Pleased to see the Senate pass #FarmBill by an 87-13 vote. Need the House to now follow suit. Strengthens the farm safety net &amp; provides certainty to producers. Not a perfect bill (SNAP work requirements &amp; forest management were missed opportunities) but legislation rarely is.
Sat down for a discussion with ag producers from Hawaii. There are so many diversified commodities grown on the islands and this group represents some of the best growers and ag leaders the state has to offer. https://t.co/AC0esCLhbB
#WOTUS rule has prevented farmers from being productive on their own land. Great news from @EPA &amp; @USACEHQ, acting to keep @POTUS's promise to repeal &amp; replace. Will bring clarity &amp; tell farmers where federal jurisdiction begins and ends. 		My statement: https://t.co/9jBgIoP5qf
Touring volcano damage in Hawaii this morning w/@hdoapio Chairperson Scott Enright, who brought several ag producers impacted by the lava flow and gas emissions from the eruption. The evidence of the fury of the volcano is staggering. https://t.co/9PaaSSGatW
Glad to see #FarmBill conf report out. Keeps strong safety net, invests in research &amp; promotes trade. Would like more on forest management &amp; SNAP work requirements, but farmers need this bill as they make decisions about next season. If it passes, I'll encourage @POTUS to sign.
Happy birthday, cousin! @sendavidperdue https://t.co/EbOb18XWsR

Gassing up this morning in Des Moines. They offer higher ethanol blends here, but we're pushing for E15 nation-wide, year-round. More ethanol means higher demand for corn, good for our growers, good for the environment. @POTUS wants to make it happen. Make #RFS Great Again! https://t.co/Ufv88B2uDN
Great day in Iowa today. Another one Thursday. https://t.co/YALOh46IXk
Tour of LICA farm here in Melbourne as our day in Iowa continues. This 80-acre farm has some innovative conservation projects going, including a bioreactor and water control structure. USDA shared the cost of both of these projects. https://t.co/qDuhTyYDi3
Love the hat: Make the RFS Great Again! @POTUS called me today and said we'll work with the @EPA to straighten out the RFS and get to 12 months of E15. https://t.co/Lt6V8apRiM
It wouldn't be the Farm Progress Show without seeing some of our fine @USDA folks. @BillAtUSDA and I hung out with Iowa @USDA_NRCS and Iowa @usdafsa staffers. Doing great work in the Hawkeye State. #FPS18 https://t.co/P34dXyp5RR

Right before I took the stage with @USDA U/S Bill Northey, I got a phone call from @POTUS. He told me to tell the folks at #FPS18 that we'll soon straighten out #RFS. 		Here's what he told me: https://t.co/7hiFsQkZ2R

Today @USDA announced details of the trade mitigation package, as directed by @POTUS, to protect U.S. farmers from unjustified retaliatory tariffs. This gives President Trump time to strike long-term deals. Program implementation Sept. 4th.  Full details: https://t.co/H1KbIhbph1
This is how you bring other nations to the negotiating table. @POTUS makes good on his pledge to strike the best deals possible for all of our economic sectors, including agriculture. This is a victory for U.S. farmers &amp; ranchers.		My full statement: https://t.co/zSXkiho7nt https://t.co/BHs7BRAD8N

Hello, Alaska! #BackToOurRoots Tour https://t.co/Ir8hJryW9U
What they say at @portvanusa is that if farmers grow it, and people buy it, they'll help ship it. To me that kinda sounds like "Do right and feed everyone." #BackToOurRoots tour continues. https://t.co/bQ09Rtdffe
They ship more wheat than any other commodity at @portvanusa, with water shipping being price-competitive with other methods. Big advantage over Gulf of Mexico ports shipping to Asia: 2 weeks vs. 6 weeks, and no Panama Canal costs. #BackToOurRoots https://t.co/nVnApIX3DR
At @portvanusa, it's primarily bulk shipping over container shipping, with 10% of U.S. wheat passing through. Here, they sample, inspect &amp; weigh grains. Feels like old hat for me. https://t.co/7zZOoJZ5AJ
Celebrating #IndependenceDay by visiting important engine for U.S. economy: @portvanusa. Before tour, briefing from Vancouver &amp; sister ports.

Discussing agriculture in Eastern Washington with @SpokesmanReview and Rep. @cathymcmorris Rodgers. Newspaper embarked on year-long focus on ag, saying it's more words written about ag than by any newspaper before. Great project to educate readers on ag issues. https://t.co/q6rrc3Ktak
Happy to join Rep. @cathymcmorris Rodgers for breakfast chat w/agricultural leaders in Eastern Washington, where agriculture is huge and they are particularly proud of their potatoes. This is the 40th state I've visited as Secretary. #BackToOurRoots tour rolls on in Spokane. https://t.co/u227PrdIZ3
Good morning from Spokane! Checking in with @KHQSean on @KHQLocalNews as we kick off another #BackToOurRoots tour. This week will take us to Washington, Idaho, Oregon &amp; Alaska. Trade and Farm Bill are on the minds of folks here, just like across all agriculture. https://t.co/PyTcabLIuj
It was a pleasure to discuss our shared priorities, @SecAzar. Ensuring the safety of our food supply is a core responsibility of @USDA and interagency collaboration is key. https://t.co/ZS1ffrYlf7
The tax cuts &amp; reforms @POTUS championed &amp; signed into law are helping agriculture. New analysis shows all family farms - small &amp; large, and across all commodities - will have lower tax rates. Much more favorable depreciable asset deductions &amp; fewer farms subject to Death Tax. https://t.co/fEKfAbJCOj
Six months after @POTUS overhauled the tax code, an analysis says tax cuts and reforms will benefit American farmers. They can keep more of what they earn to help their own families or invest in their operations. Great for the ag economy and all Americans. https://t.co/w4xdy1csdI
Appeared on @SquawkCNBC this morning, laying out why @POTUS has held China accountable for its unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft. American farmers are patriots and will not have to bear the brunt of China's retaliation. 		Video:	https://t.co/OP2N2QE99K
Our flight from Chicago to D.C. was cancelled (like many flights out of O'Hare today), so we roadtripped up to Milwaukee to enjoy some local hospitality at @milwaukeeburger. Nice place and nice people. The young fella didn't quite know what to make of us. https://t.co/e4MsIGuKSl
Busy day in Chicago and great to be with one of my predecessors, former Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman. We have a lot in common, not the least of which is working with the best workforce in government: the employees of @USDA. https://t.co/SAMjQRQBtG
Wrapping up a full day in Chicago with a meeting with @CMEGroup. Glad to be with former Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman talking about agricultural trade and other issues important to farmers. https://t.co/vIPALxiE6T
Happy to participate in another Global Food Forum, hosted in Chicago by @WSJ, w/@MaryAnastasiaOG, Paul Gigot &amp; Anthony Pratt of @PrattIndustries. Q&amp;A session focused mainly on trade issues and the need for a stable, legal agricultural workforce. https://t.co/xMnLXq2Njt
Good discussion in Chicago with Anthony Pratt of @PrattIndustries, @WSJ &amp; leaders in agriculture and food industry. It's a growing world out there and U.S. ag production will be at the forefront in feeding it. https://t.co/HBkTwXgFiN
On the expo floor at @UnitedFresh 2018, companies from across the entire supply chain are sharing new ideas about production, shipping, food safety, and most importantly, promoting the increased consumption of fresh produce. https://t.co/JfMGjySJQX
Cutting the ribbon to officially open the expo floor at the @UnitedFresh 2018 conference. Great place to learn about advancements in the supply chain for "fresh, healthy &amp; better-for-you products." https://t.co/7b1aOB5GRi
Beginning my day in Chicago, speaking at the @UnitedFresh 2018 conference. Meeting with folks hoping to #DiscoverMore from people along the entire supply chain of fresh produce. https://t.co/qGNKZm1SBx
.@POTUS instructed @USDA to craft strategy to help farmers facing China's retaliatory tariffs. We have tools to use, but we haven't unveiled strategy - not good to open playbook while opposing team watches. If China doesn't mend ways, we'll act. My op-ed:https://t.co/4ftfLMdQeA
China steals U.S. intellectual property &amp; forces transfer of technology. Chinese nationals even caught digging up genetically-engineered corn seeds in Iowa to send home. Correct Chinese response is to stop stealing, not reinforce &amp; retaliate.		My op-ed: https://t.co/4ftfLMdQeA
.@POTUS standing up to China, which wrongly believes it can bully U.S. farmers to get us to back away from our nat'l interests. There must be consequences for China's bad acts, but POTUS won't let U.S. ag bear brunt of retaliation. 		My op-ed in @USATODAY: https://t.co/4ftfLMdQeA
It took some perseverance and hard work, but the House has passed its version of the #FarmBill. Much work left to be done, but an important hurdle cleared. Thanks, Chairman @ConawayTX11. My full statement: https://t.co/EpnUccL5eb
Kudos to @ConawayTX11 &amp; House Ag Committee for full House passage of #FarmBill.  Very important to give the agriculture community some much-needed certainty.

My friend and counterpart @L_MacAulay showing me the local lobsters off #PrinceEdwardIsland. These are pretty good, but I'd say our U.S. lobstermen could give them a run for their money. https://t.co/QxiQsxd4Z3
Off #PrinceEdwardIsland with @L_Macaulay at a lobster fishery with local lobsterman Bobby Jenkins. The U.S. and Canada make science based decision and work together to keep our agricultural sectors competitive and our fisheries healthy. https://t.co/SBekijKTja

A Farm Bill is necessary to provide farmers, ranchers, foresters, and producers with the stability and predictability they need. Our farmers feed the people of this nation and the world, and they deserve the certainty of a Farm Bill.
House scheduled to vote today on #FarmBill. Our farmers are the bedrock of America, putting their hands in the soil to feed our nation. Important to support our farmers with the certainty of a Farm Bill. https://t.co/scxpgzzKz0

Hello, Wyoming...		#BackToOurRoots Tour rolls on. https://t.co/TcW2Iuq4Zc
Trying my hand at blow darts, one way to sedate feral swine. Once the hogs are captured, they are collared and tagged so they can lead us back to their friends. National Wildlife Research Center is a fascinating place. #BackToOurRoots https://t.co/EAb38vWA9p
They're fighting rabies at @USDA's Nat'l Wildlife Research Ctr in Fort Collins. Worldwide, there are still about 60,000 human cases of rabies - mostly transmitted by canines - each year. The goal is to wipe it out by 2030. #BackToOurRoots Tour rolls on through Colorado. https://t.co/oAGljAIpqj

On this #NationalDayOfPrayer, I am praying for our nation and her citizens, that they may use their God-given talents to better themselves, their families, and their communities. Faith has shaped my own life and I pray that others may find that strength as well.

Meeting today with @SorghumGrowers, who are facing duties of almost 179% from China. Chinese claim of "dumping" of sorghum is not credible in the international grain market, which is about the freest market there is. U.S. producers are the most competitive in the world. https://t.co/nkG9Vj2KJn
A very cordial meeting with new Japanese Ambassador to the U.S., Shinsuke Sugiyama. Face-to-face discussion, hoping to build on relationship with long-standing trading partner. Would like better access for our products in their markets. https://t.co/lbPavr1mzx

Talking Colorado River Basin water issues at #WaterInTheWest2018 w/fmr Ag Sec Vilsack. I'm a skin-in-the-game kind of guy. In order to solve water shortage problems, must partner w/fed, state, local &amp; private - all those who have interest must be involved. https://t.co/ITOrazm5iN
With my predecessor, fmr Sec. Tom Vilsack in Denver at #WaterInTheWest2018 symposium hosted by @ColoradoStateU.

It's been a busy first 12 months on the job at @USDA. Many accomplishments, many challenges remaining. Was sworn in a year ago today. We've been to 35 states so far, listening to the people of American agriculture. 		Here's a quick video recap: 	https://t.co/iw8JMtYuBw
A year ago today, I took the oath to become the 31st U.S. Secretary of Agriculture. Since then, we've visited 35 states, talking with the people of American agriculture &amp; relaying their concerns to Washington. Here's a new website that takes a look back: https://t.co/g4q11EXyJx https://t.co/BCQqZZ7eTE
A year ago today, a fellow Georgian, Justice Clarence Thomas, administered my oath of office as the 31st Secretary of Agriculture. Proud to have had Mary by my side, as well as some of our 14 grandchildren, who were happy to come to work with their Big Buddy that day. https://t.co/kqFvz2OBGm
Great batch of spring @USDA interns winding down their time with us. They help us with our day-to-day duties and hopefully learn something along the way. May this be the first stop on long, successful careers. https://t.co/68VvjivYHW
One year ago this evening, the Senate confirmed me as Secretary of Agriculture, with my cousin @sendavidperdue presiding that night. Best part so far is meeting the people of American agriculture (35 states visited to date). Much accomplished, more to do &amp; many challenges ahead. https://t.co/uyn9d8terJ
Celebrating one-year anniversary of my Senate confirmation by testifying about the State of Rural America at Senate Ag Committee. Covered a lot of ground: trade, rural broadband, labor issues, regulations, Farm Bill, RFS, forest management, many other topics. https://t.co/0ANB3UVxaQ

Greeted by @MdAgDept Secretary Joseph Bartenfelder in Annapolis for a meeting with state ag leaders from MD, NY, PA, DE, VA &amp; WV. Talking about the latest from @USDA &amp; how we can help states with their own issues. https://t.co/9M1dFmcW97
Americans are generous people and have built programs for those in need. But prolonged reliance on government assistance was never part of the American Dream. @POTUS's executive order reduces poverty and promotes opportunity. 		My op-ed: https://t.co/x58XSVwWRF
It's true that we get the best ideas when we're out talking to the people who actually put their hands in the soil. https://t.co/t0V8jCExFi

I commend Chairman @ConawayTX11 and House Ag Committee for passing 2018 Farm Bill, in line w/@USDA's principles released in January. As GOP &amp; Dems have farm interests at home, hope it can move in a bipartisan way through full House and Senate. Statement: https://t.co/hXQAXsyGoM
Widespread access to broadband in rural America will be transformative and increase prosperity. At @USDA today, kicking off series of listening sessions to help identify needed tools for expansion. @POTUS has made it a priority. @AjitPaiFCC &amp; @SecretaryRoss are great partners. https://t.co/XdzrN03C6N
China's announced duties of 179% on U.S. sorghum is clearly a political move. International grain market is about the freest market in the world, so it's ludicrous to mention "dumping." We stand with producers &amp; reject China's premise.		Full statement: https://t.co/NxFlU0OHin
This morning at @USDA, we're hosting the kick-off listening session to identify tools needed to expand broadband access across rural America.  This effort is born of @POTUS's Rural Prosperity Task Force. 		Tune in live at about 9:30 ET: https://t.co/Qmf3jehZUw
Mary &amp; I are saddened by the passing of Barbara Bush, the steady, witty &amp; strong matriarch of the Bush family and classy former First Lady.

One year ago today at my confirmation hearing, I called for a fix for @forestservice fire suppression funding. A year later, after a lot of work by @USDA and Congressional leaders, it's in the Omnibus. Healthy forests help prevent severe wildfires. #FlashbackFriday https://t.co/9x02YKSIuZ
Big $600 million boost for rural broadband in #Omnibus. New pilot grant &amp; loan combo program, administered by @USDA, will provide high-speed Internet access to rural and tribal areas. Dovetails nicely with @POTUS infrastructure agenda. Full press release: https://t.co/Q2t1025V8d
We shouldn't be picking winners &amp; losers in agriculture w/the federal tax code, but that's what happened through a glitch in Section 199A. I congratulate Congress for hearing the voices of Ag &amp; fixing the problem in the Omnibus.		Full press release: https://t.co/BsOfV9eCBr
This is a decades-long problem addressed. Kudos to Congress &amp; @POTUS for new way @forestservice firefighting is funded. With better forest management, we can mitigate the frequency of wildfires &amp; severity of future fire seasons. Full press release: https://t.co/zYpGuaszeo
Mary and I are saddened by the death of our friend, Zell Miller, son of the Georgia mountains, veteran &amp; public servant. We are praying for Shirley, the Miller family, and his many friends. Zell's legacy will resonate in Georgia for generations to come. May he rest in peace.
Omnibus released by Congressional leaders contains items of importance to rural U.S. &amp; Ag: fixes 199A tax glitch, addresses @forestservice fire funding, supports broadband access, clears red tape for farmers &amp; more. Look forward to passage. 		Statement: https://t.co/aabfkcrl6j

Nice welcome at Porterville Citrus in Visalia, CA. They own and operate 6 packing houses in Tulare County and pack more than 12 million cartons of citrus a year. That's agriculture creating jobs! https://t.co/DdfmJSvcoj
Always great to be with you, @RepDavidValadao. I am continuously amazed by the vast agricultural bounty of the Central Valley and California generally. https://t.co/e5e2rMUlTf
Great picture in this morning's @FresnoBee from @World_Ag_Expo yesterday. Had fun with my new friend Noah and his new pals @RepJeffDenham &amp; @RepJimCosta. https://t.co/EsLFM7aLU0
It was great to see everybody at @World_Ag_Expo. You have bright futures ahead in agricultural sciences. https://t.co/e0xyfWoDiH
The amount of agricultural products and equipment is just staggering at @World_Ag_Expo in Tulare, CA. Almost as impressive as California's agricultural diversity. https://t.co/79Jxzy6ZcL
Another Secretary Selfie! This time with our fine folks from @usdaRD at @World_Ag_Expo in Tulare, CA. These @USDA employees are often the primary representatives farmers, ranchers &amp; foresters interact with. https://t.co/8SjhEhYYFy
Touring @World_Ag_Expo w/@RepJeffDenham &amp; @RepJimCosta in Tulare, CA. Rep. Costa found his home crowd from @Fresno_State. Do Fresno State Bulldogs bark too? At @universityofga they do. https://t.co/coRO2BBk0t
Excellent choice by @POTUS of Naomi Earp as @USDA Asst Sec. for Civil Rights. Long career in civil rights issues and the fed government. Hope Senate will take up her nomination at the earliest opportunity, along with our other nominees awaiting action. https://t.co/1pK7LpZ6tR
Some of our excellent @usdafsa employees from Davis, CA turned out at @World_Ag_Expo - even had t-shirts made for the occasion. Seems I've heard that motto somewhere before. https://t.co/U0dsBZv1X3
The infrastructure agenda announced by @POTUS is going over well in this @World_Ag_Expo town hall meeting with agriculture leaders in Tulare, CA. 25 percent of new federal money in the plan will go to rural America. https://t.co/Ypmnwg2Sb2
Where else would I see some of the impressive @NationalFFA kids if not at @World_Ag_Expo in Tulare, CA? And I'm grateful to have been presented with the prestigious orange jacket that volunteers at the expo wear. https://t.co/FNxbI0KYgY
When I became Secretary of Agriculture, I was told I couldn't miss @World_Ag_Expo in Tulare, CA. So now I'm here and can't wait for a town hall session and to tour the expo. The expanse of California agriculture is truly remarkable. https://t.co/MRKc4NPsW8
When I'm out traveling the country, I usually like to pop in on our @USDA staff in local offices. Here with the @usdaRD crew in #LasVegas. Very excited about @POTUS infrastructure agenda which includes $50 billion for rural America. https://t.co/SPY9WczV58
Interesting visit to family-run @AndersonDairyLV in #LasVegas, operated by Searles &amp; Coon families since 1934. Milk comes daily to the plant where it's tested, processed, packaged, and then delivered. They also distribute frozen dairy and related products. https://t.co/X5vPQxxyuX
Great tour of @AndersonDairyLV in #LasVegas with a long history. Begun in 1907, it started with 10-15 cows. Back then without refrigeration, milk was delivered by wagon 2X a day. Searles &amp; Coon families bought it in 1934 and still run it today. https://t.co/WguYlQq85K
It's true! @USDA is everywhere! https://t.co/5B0VDoteJC
Nice @8NewsNow coverage of our visit to Gilcrease Orchard near #LasVegas yesterday. It's absolutely true that we always get our best ideas from talking to farmers &amp; ranchers who are out on the front lines of agriculture. https://t.co/AT9RCqIcMK
Town hall-style meeting at Gilcrease Orchard near Las Vegas. Good discussion of agricultural issues like excessive regulation, which @POTUS is tackling. Also the president's infrastructure agenda, which will help rural America tremendously. Thanks @NVFarmBureau for hosting. https://t.co/eWKqnjJX6u
Gilcrease Orchard outside Las Vegas sells produce for eight months of the year. The family also has a dedicated youth education program (see the @4H kids for proof of that). https://t.co/gNW0kvtT5G
Catching up with Las Vegas's finest. Members of the @LVMPD out with us today. #VegasStrong https://t.co/DOsX1HaFog
You obviously weren't afraid to ham it up, @ChristyNews3LV! Meanwhile, your photog sounds like he needs to spend a little more time on the farm getting his hands dirty. Glad you could be with us. https://t.co/AtlvriXwEx
Food waste collected at various Las Vegas casinos &amp; restaurants comes here to Las Vegas Livestock. The Combs Brothers' operation feeds almost 3,000 hogs and 300 chickens solely on recycled scrap food. https://t.co/bd7X9ffl5u
The recycling dock at @AriaLV is more than what it looks like. Last year, Combs Brothers recycling diverted 4,000 tons of food waste for use in feeding livestock. This process is a model for the world. https://t.co/b5ajD5PwtJ
Rural America will see 25 percent of new federal money in @POTUS infrastructure goals, with states making choices about priorities. Will be much-needed boost in increasing rural prosperity. https://t.co/rwt2PwgiOC

Under @POTUS infrastructure agenda, 25% of new federal money goes to rural America, meaning expanded broadband access, rebuilt roads &amp; affordable utilities. States will have flexibility to choose which projects best meet their unique needs. My statement: https://t.co/hoAGOb4Xhx
It's been a priority for @POTUS to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure &amp; today's initiative demonstrates his commitment. With words &amp; deeds he proves that rural America is close to his heart - 25% of new federal money goes to rural areas. https://t.co/hoAGOb4Xhx
Great crowd at @NationalGrocers #NGAShow18 in Las Vegas. Independent grocery stores are part of the fabric of communities across our great country. They innovate, give great customer service, and most importantly, feed people. https://t.co/kipYL19opZ

Our @USDAFoodSafety personnel put in a lot of game prep leading up to #SuperbowlLII, conducting surveillance on @USDA regulated products like wings, burgers &amp; hotdogs in Minneapolis. All to ensure protection of the food supply.
As kickoff of #SuperBowlLII approaches, want to thank our @USDAFoodSafety employees in MN who have worked around the clock to ensure the food supply in and around the stadium is safe &amp; wholesome. Perfect example of "Do right &amp; feed everyone!"
Proud to name 5 new leaders in @USDA's Departmental Administration. We're working to make USDA the most effective, most efficient, best-managed department in the entire federal government. These highly qualified people help us toward that goal, Release: https://t.co/Tym9ZMXS9F

Touring Michigan Turkey Producers in Grand Rapids, MI. Locally-owned, MTP was founded as a co-op by 15 growers looking for better ways to bring their birds to market. Naturally, we have @USDA inspectors here, as always, ensuring the safety of the U.S. food supply. https://t.co/58I8R5G3n1
This is the best way to learn what's happening on the ground - talk to the people on the front lines of American agriculture. At Heeren Brothers' apple operation, a discussion with Michigan producers and the Heeren Brothers leadership team. https://t.co/bX9IBkk9tP
#Michigan is the 32nd state I've visited in nine months as Secretary of Agriculture. At Heeren Brothers in Comstock Park, they process 50,000 pounds of apples every hour. https://t.co/aehnUOS3rK

Had the pleasure of meeting Maria Martinez @m_angelica25 at @IPPEexpo today. She's a proud graduate of the @NationalFFA program at John Bowne HS in Queens, NY. One of the most unique, inspiring urban #FFA programs I've seen. https://t.co/1LkXszByEn
There's no more noble or honorable effort than feeding the world. That's what I told the @NationalFFA youngsters at @IPPEexpo in Atlanta. Seeing these kids always gives me confidence about the future of agriculture. https://t.co/9vx5teX1u3
Even though @IPPEexpo is being held in Atlanta, it's drawn @NationalFFA kids from across the country. Their exposure to policy makers and industry leaders will serve them well as they take on their own leadership roles in agriculture. https://t.co/9y2SD8Tjbt
I never miss a chance to highlight the impressive young people of @NationalFFA. At @IPPEexpo, we asked students in the audience to stand and be recognized for their important leadership in the next generation of agriculture. https://t.co/PFrtKrKOhT
At the @IPPEexpo in Atlanta, people still talking about @POTUS #SOTU last night &amp; optimistic message it sent. At @USDA we aim to clear barriers and provide services to help the agriculture sector improve productivity. https://t.co/Lc9CnTBahV
The 1st year of the Trump Administration saw great accomplishments for all Americans, including those in agriculture &amp; rural America.  @POTUS delivered a hopeful, unifying #SOTU that bodes well for a strong nation growing stronger. My full statement: https://t.co/jmpG8Ygsyt
Very optimistic #SOTU from @POTUS tonight. Focused on accomplishments, booming economy, vision for the future.  State of the Union is strong and getting stronger.
Opioid addiction really hits rural America hard. @POTUS attention to the problem truly elevates the epidemic to national attention. #SOTU
This @POTUS is a strong negotiator and I have confidence that he will strike fair trade deals that benefit the entire nation, including the agriculture sector. #SOTU
Job training and workforce development touted by @POTUS are also key to plans to improve the quality of life in rural America. New and expanding businesses want to hire the best workers. #SOTU
The infrastructure agenda from @POTUS is much-needed in rural America. Very important in our efforts to increase rural prosperity. #SOTU
When I'm out talking to agricultural producers, one of the biggest problems they tell me about is excessive regulation from Washington. @POTUS focus on cutting red tape is a welcome change that helps remove obstacles to farm productivity. #SOTU
The tax cuts and reforms package promised and delivered by @POTUS is already spurring great economic growth.  The job creation and big boost in the economy benefit all Americans, including those working hard in the agriculture sector. #SOTU
I am continuously amazed by the bravery of our @forestservice firefighters. In #SOTU, @POTUS just praised David Dahlberg, who "faced down walls of flame" to save children &amp; staff in a camp in CA. I had the great honor of meeting David today. He's a guest seated w/@FLOTUS tonight. https://t.co/a8deHiLkFG
I'm not in the House chamber tonight, but I'm watching and looking forward to a common sense #SOTU from @POTUS that is optimistic and unifying.
Incredible story, how @forestservice firefighter David Dahlberg bravely barreled down an access road during a wildfire, saving dozens of children &amp; staff stranded at a ranch camp in CA last July.

The @psucreamery is the largest university-owned creamery in the country. Although primarily known for ice cream, they also produce milk, yogurt, cream cheese, sour cream, and other dairy products. Might have to perform a snap inspection. https://t.co/8T0aYqr6Zh

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. would have been 89 years old today. He said, "Life's most persistent and urgent question is: What are you doing for others?" 		At @USDA we try to uphold Dr. King's legacy by doing right and feeding everyone.		#MLKDay https://t.co/fYeHFlyGzJ
A fine selection by @POTUS, tapping Ken Barbic as @USDA Asst Secretary for Congressional Relations. Great combination of legislative experience and leadership promoting U.S. agricultural competitiveness. https://t.co/rD9T46I9xG
Proud to introduce old friend @RepDavidScott at @USDA ceremony honoring Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s life of service. Dr. King called all of us to work to create a Beloved Community to improve society. https://t.co/Q9etpSsRBD
Glad to catch up with my old friend @RepDavidScott. We served in the Georgia legislature together. I'll be introducing him at @USDA's #MLK National Service Day ceremonies in a few minutes. https://t.co/XjOmDk2GCA

It was an honor to chair President Trump's Task Force on Rural Prosperity. We formally submitted our report and recommendations today:		https://t.co/5NxnVc6C2C https://t.co/CI0WpXmacN
High-speed Internet access, E-Connectivity, is key to spurring increased prosperity in rural America. That's one key finding in our Task Force report delivered to @POTUS today. 		My op-ed: https://t.co/WRDBuCZGd6
Thanks to @kilmeade for the opportunity. Big day for agriculture and the @FarmBureau! https://t.co/8YSKUFUqBQ

Some of these young folks tell me they made our Twitter feed when we were Indianapolis for the @NationalFFA convention. Well, at @FarmBureau convention, here we go again! https://t.co/K6Z5NXPxZC
And what would a visit to the @FarmBureau convention be without the FFA-ers?  Great to see @tnffa represented. https://t.co/lNoFm6U8n0
Shining a light on women in agriculture - "FarmHer" is the word here. Great message at @FarmBureau convention as we look to increase rural prosperity. https://t.co/xlgeniVhLl

Early morning at Nashville's Pancake Pantry to talk to @foxandfriends @kilmeade about increasing rural prosperity. Will present report to @POTUS later today. https://t.co/5X0DhtYj3H
Happy to announce @usdafsa state committee members. These are vital, as they serve as liaisons between @USDA and producers in states by keeping them informed and hearing their appeals and complaints. Listing: https://t.co/qtQ3NFIfAf
With every seed farmers plant in the soil, they are exhibiting their faith in a bountiful harvest to come. There's nothing more American than that. As 2018 dawns, let's embrace the promise it holds and work together to fulfill that potential. #HappyNewYear to all. https://t.co/jlnRO7IvTH
We know that most people don't click on the links in tweets. But if you do, check out this one. You'll see that 2017 was a full year at @USDA. Many accomplishments across our agencies and offices. https://t.co/FR9K0n2nRS https://t.co/iQLSRk70Kt
Hurricanes Harvey, Irma &amp; Maria devastated 5 states, Puerto Rico &amp; the U.S. Virgin Islands in 2017. @USDA helped feed people and assist producers following the storms. People in agriculture are hardy &amp; resilient. They will recover and USDA will be there. https://t.co/FR9K0n2nRS https://t.co/Ecr3vYk4Qd
2017 saw the costliest wildfire season on record, as USDA's @forestservice deployed over 25,000 brave personnel, who risked their own lives to protect people and property. Long-desired fix to fire suppression funding problem appears to be in reach. https://t.co/FR9K0n2nRS https://t.co/vfZzbkXavR
The first of its kind, the ethics app @USDA unveiled in 2017 provides answers to government ethics questions, emphasizing commitment to the highest degree of integrity. Available to federal employees or the general public on Apple or Android devices. https://t.co/FR9K0n2nRS https://t.co/lYJTcL6mT1
We created the first-ever Under Secretary for Trade &amp; Foreign Agricultural Affairs at @USDA in 2017. New U/S Ted McKinney hit the ground running (or flying, really) and wakes up every day looking to sell American products in more foreign markets. https://t.co/FR9K0n2nRS https://t.co/3nBpoF2Szp
In 2017, @USDA launched an initiative to provide timely and comprehensive support for U.S. military veterans who want to pursue careers in agriculture. Check out https://t.co/L27aAsRStK. https://t.co/gvmGBvGSQW
In 2017 @USDA responded to local school nutrition workers, parents &amp; students to provide greater flexibility and local control of school meals. New ability to provide nutritious meals kids actually want to eat. https://t.co/FR9K0n2nRS https://t.co/ZohCh8GETS
2017 was a big year for trade victories at @USDA. Beef to China 1st time in 13 years, rice to China 1st time ever. Easing of EU regs for U.S. citrus, chipping potatoes into Japan, poultry into South Korea. More: https://t.co/FR9K0n2nRS https://t.co/DI5FLLTTbG
We reorganized @USDA in 2017 to work toward our goal of being the most effective, most efficient, most customer-focused department in the federal government. 1st ever U/S for Trade, new domestically-focused mission area, IT improvements. https://t.co/FR9K0n2nRS https://t.co/op0bj0zQ8V
2017 was a great year for reaching thousands of young people interested in agricultural careers (and for Secretary Selfies too). We signed MOUs with @NationalFFA and with SCORE, and also worked closely with @4H. The future for these kids is now. https://t.co/FR9K0n2nRS https://t.co/EfJ8ZLoy1x
As 2017 draws to a close, looking back on a busy year at @USDA. Since I was sworn in near the end of April, I've been to 30 states and 6 foreign countries, promoting the interests of American agriculture. A quick review of what we accomplished together: https://t.co/FR9K0n2nRS
Mary and I wish you a happy, healthy &amp; merry Christmas. We hope you will be able to spend time with friends and family, reflecting on the many blessings we all enjoy as Americans. #MerryChristmas https://t.co/vZlARuJ28r
We are pleased to report that @USDA_APHIS has issued a movement permit to a Mr. S. Claus of the North Pole to allow entry and exit of reindeer during the evening hours of December 24th and early morning hours of December 25th. 		Official announcement: https://t.co/mHpTlmFbJF
We certainly didn't want Walter the camel to miss his debut as a key player in the living nativity scene.  @USDA was happy to help, @SenJohnThune! https://t.co/6BErfjrBjQ
It's been a busy year at @USDA, traveling the nation talking to producers, reorganizing the department, notching trade victories, granting flexibility for school meals, responding to hurricanes &amp; fighting wildfires. Here's more: https://t.co/FR9K0n2nRS
Very kind of you, @SecretaryZinke, thank you! Look forward to working with you even more in the coming year. https://t.co/Ax6Y2RlkND
Had a visit to the @USDA TV studio today and said thanks to our own Larry Holmes, who is retiring after 44 years of federal service. Thank you for your work on behalf of the people of agriculture. https://t.co/W6JDt20cc9
Thank you, @SenPatRoberts! https://t.co/FB16l0mhrZ
#TaxCutAndJobsAct is long-awaited Christmas present for taxpayers, who will keep more of what they earn. Great for agriculture, great for overall economy. Thanks @POTUS for strong leadership &amp; Congress for being responsive to the people. https://t.co/dEbkqtzALH
We now have over 1,000 @forestservice personnel on the ground and in the air fighting the #ThomasFire. Our engagement with @CAL_FIRE continues to grow, as our courageous @USDA employees head toward the danger to protect lives and property. https://t.co/fCyUudCR2V
More than 900 @forestservice personnel remain engaged in fighting the #ThomasFire alone, working with @CAL_FIRE, assisting with ground and air fire suppression. It's extremely hazardous work and we are thankful for their selflessness and bravery. https://t.co/p0FSv3OOFJ
Grateful for the bravery of the nearly 950 men &amp; women of @USDA's @forestservice who are fighting the fires in California. Forest Service presence has increased as they risk their lives to protect people and property. https://t.co/XGr9Pq6wCF
This is tremendous news and it will make a great Christmas present for the American people. Kudos to @POTUS for his leadership, and thanks to Congress for being responsive to the people's call for tax relief. https://t.co/C2YujWsinZ
Good meeting with @VP to talk tax cuts &amp; reforms and economic competitiveness. With Gov. @AsaHutchinson, Gov. Rick Snyder (@onetoughnerd), Gov. @KimReynoldsIA, Gov. @BillHaslam &amp; @SecretaryRoss. https://t.co/55eYtwfex4
Deputy Secretary Steve Censky unveiled @USDA's new IT operating model at @WhiteHouse Office of American Innovation event. Much more data-driven and customer-focused. https://t.co/EPLiI60cmu https://t.co/wBc5aKBmHU
The tax cuts and reforms championed by @POTUS would make a tremendous Christmas present for Americans, including those in agriculture. Most family farms are small businesses, and they need relief to provide for their families and to reinvest in their own operations. https://t.co/mOntMWt9ap
14 associations cited science and data when they announced support for @USDA flexibility and greater local control of school meals. Nutritious meals are no good if kids don't eat them. Trash cans don't need the nourishment. https://t.co/VJA3ZOm9Pv
Very much appreciate the letter of support from 14 associations, agreeing with @USDA flexibility and greater local control of school meals. Students won't eat school meals if they aren't appealing! #MakeSchoolLunchGreatAgain https://t.co/EKsafj2Oct
To everyone celebrating, may the Menorah candles shine strongly and may you be with the ones you love. Mary and I wish you eight days of peace and joy. Happy Hanukkah! https://t.co/HyMoZ4uSPe

At @Interior for a discussion of practices to prevent severe wildfires, such as we've seen in California &amp; wide swaths of the nation this year. Thanks to @SecretaryZinke, @RepRobBishop, @RepWesterman &amp; @forestservice Chief Tooke, plus many stakeholders in attendance. https://t.co/KYQrF5Ly1f
Nice coverage of our visit to @FAMU_1887 on Friday, where I met some very impressive young people who are pursuing careers in agriculture. Got to find ways to convince more of their peers to enter the field. Ag can be about more than just farming. https://t.co/SWxvNWVKPK
We've granted Arizona a 2-year SNAP waiver to test a program to prevent fraud. If a recipient requests  more than 2 replacement benefit cards in 12 months, AZ can request direct contact with the recipient. https://t.co/iN6YCELNSv
Wide-ranging panel discussion at @FAMU_1887 w/faculty, students &amp; @RepAlLawsonJr to talk about youths in agriculture. Asking what they'd like to see in 2018 #FarmBill to draw young people into ag careers. https://t.co/dh6R2jtkDi
The breadth of knowledge already residing in the young people I encounter is always impressive. At @FAMU_1887, the students I'm with are ready to begin their careers in agriculture. https://t.co/qLfrZCxjX1
Nice lunch with @FAMU_1887 students who have either interned with @USDA or are USDA 1890 National Scholars. Hearing about their career plans, I know the future of agriculture is bright. https://t.co/wXGNVkbOp2
Before our roundtable discussion about youth in agriculture, some @FAMU_1887 students show off what they've been working on. https://t.co/XHV1edCpXy
Just arrived at @FAMU_1887 in Tallahassee, with @RepAlLawsonJr &amp; FAMU President @LRobinsonFAMU. Will meet w/students &amp; talk about youth involvement in agriculture. https://t.co/KqBQMpg9K6
In Tallahassee, so why not an unannounced visit to the @forestservice office here? Talking to the folks about the usefulness of prescribed burning to help mitigate wildfires. Their minds are on the fires in CA as well. https://t.co/EEJZCfHAiM
USDA's @forestservice remains significantly involved in fighting these fires. Brave men and women risking their lives to protect people and property. https://t.co/Zz9phvokim
Not a surprise to me, but great to see @USDA ranked in the top ten best places to work in the federal government in annual survey. Up two spots from last year's ranking. It's all about the top-notch, professional workforce we have. https://t.co/WCrbqDcIsr
Our @forestservice has more than 800 personnel and over 30 aircraft fighting these fires, both on National Forest lands and elsewhere assisting @CAL_FIRE. Team effort in trying times. https://t.co/yOuerxHlOG
My office feels a lot more like Christmas thanks to this beautiful North Carolina tree, presented by @RepMarkMeadows and grown by Rodney Buchanan. Could be a problem that there's no chimney for Santa to come down. @NCChristmasTree https://t.co/Ewo4v03GJp
What a sight to begin the Christmas season. A beautiful Engelmann Spruce from the Kootenai National Forest in Montana - this year's U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree. @USCapitolTree https://t.co/WC6FpoJAF0
Any minute now, we're going to light up this tree - the official U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree. All the way from Montana. https://t.co/PuJUl440wR

Face-to-face with our new @usdafsa state directors, in Washington, DC for their orientation. Impressing on them our continued emphasis on making @USDA the most effective, most efficient, most customer-focused dept in federal government. https://t.co/5JWi7xJbbP
The state directors for @usdaRD are wrapping up their orientation in DC, so I'm happy to give them an overview of our efforts to increase prosperity in rural America. Meeting with new @usdafsa state directors in a little while. https://t.co/3RCnFPEM6q
SNAP was created to provide people w/help they need to feed themselves &amp; their families. Not meant to be permanent lifestyle. We want to provide nutrition, but also to help transition from government programs, back to work, into lives of independence. https://t.co/AMihXkkaGt
Coming soon, @USDANutrition will be working with states to give more local control over SNAP where the goals are helping people achieve self-sufficiency, promoting program integrity &amp; improving customer service. https://t.co/AMihXkkaGt
Feels like home at the @WhiteHouse this morning, as county commissioners (and some state legislators) from Georgia are in town. As former governor &amp; state legislator, I know how important it is for local officials to have access to federal leaders. https://t.co/RH2tZMiKxe
Our state directors for @usdaRD and @usdafsa are in DC for @USDA orientation. Happy to talk with them individually for a bit and get a picture or two. They're the ones out on the front lines of agriculture in the states. https://t.co/GAWdFkPQ3g
Boy, am I glad to see these folks. Swearing in new state directors from across the country for @usdaRD and @usdafsa. These are our representatives out in the field, who are the face of @USDA for so many of our customers. https://t.co/HatnhVGECE
Tax cuts and reforms will be important boosts for American agriculture. Most family farms operate as small businesses &amp; need freedom to grow, create jobs &amp; provide for their families. Thank you, @POTUS, for your leadership in moving toward this historic relief for taxpayers. https://t.co/jxgncWAuiZ
Good conversation in Phoenix with members of @WestGov. As a former governor myself, I understand the issues they deal with. Discussed trade, forest management, wildfire funding, among others issues. https://t.co/OfUos1tFxp
Telling @DanSpindle from @abc15 in Phoenix that agriculture will benefit tremendously from tax cuts and reforms. Most farms are small businesses, so tax relief will help them and create jobs. Just like for the rest of the U.S. economy. https://t.co/S1kVA23NXK
Projected U.S. farm exports for fiscal year 2018 look pretty solid.  $140 billion expected, would be 4th-best year on record. We want to keep it up and find more markets for more American agricultural products.  https://t.co/VhgWfGtypo
Yep. Those are all roses, as far as the eye can see. Francis Roses near Litchfield Park, ArIzona. I visit a lot of farms as part of my job. But not too many like this one. https://t.co/mu39ahVkoH
If only Twitter could convey the way this field of roses smells at Francis Roses in Arizona. Beautiful and aromatic. They supply about 1/4 of the roses in U.S. &amp; Canadian markets. https://t.co/rfUGUVpnlT
Nice welcome at Francis Roses near Litchfield Park, Arizona. Always good to check in with producers of all kinds to hear how business is going. Ideas and concerns are best gathered by talking to folks on the front lines of agriculture. https://t.co/RrKz3Fpxbd
Productive discussions w/@azagriculture Director Mark Killian &amp; AZ ag leaders. We talked taxes, trade, regulations, labor issues. Really helpful to hear from folks on the ground in these fact-finding listening sessions. https://t.co/xToHfPevFq
In Arizona and happy to see legendary farm broadcaster Orion Samuelson. He's everywhere! https://t.co/skQYGKLxbr
Nice tour of @azagriculture Director Mark Killian's ranch. They partner w/@UofA's @USDA certified beef processing plant. Allows them to sell beef inside and outside of Arizona. https://t.co/VM9YSWi880
At the @AgRetailers Conference &amp; Expo in Phoenix, talking to the folks who provide the supplies &amp; services ag producers need. Encouraged them to be engaged in the democratic process, because @POTUS listens to the people. #ARA2017 https://t.co/wFQs8KLcx3
.@POTUS is right. Like shop owners on Main Street, U.S. farmers need to turn a profit to grow their operations, create jobs &amp; feed their families. It takes too much time, effort &amp; expense just to comply with the onerous tax code. People need relief. https://t.co/ucrxtVIuFa
Was happy to be able to bring granddaughter Rabun, the youngest 4H-er at @Nat4HCongress. Here meeting @micah_trull74, who shows off his pin lanyard. https://t.co/OX62Q59KEA

America's farmers produce over 44 billion pounds of potatoes and 3 billion pounds of sweet potatoes each year. Feel like we did our part to put a dent in those numbers at the Perdue family Thanksgiving. https://t.co/AnxGlccz2e
Some scenes from the Perdue family Thanksgiving. The lady in the pink jacket is Aunt Elizabeth, my father's only surviving sister, who hosted the event at her house for many years. https://t.co/dmL9xyWM8j
Such a blessed Thanksgiving at the Perdue family gathering. Here's hoping you are able to spend time with your own friends and family. https://t.co/VQbNhn769a
On this #Thanksgiving, let us be thankful for loved ones, the God-given freedoms we hold dear, all the blessings we enjoy as Americans, and for the farmers, ranchers, foresters &amp; producers who feed, fuel &amp; clothe this nation. https://t.co/hnoR1trwcA
As we prepare for #Thanksgiving, I hope you are planning to share time with friends, family, and loved ones. I reflect that we have much to be thankful for as Americans. And if you are preparing a meal, please remember we have American farmers to thank for the bounty. https://t.co/QCiCHcCSBe
Story behind the story: Drumstick was raised on Carl &amp; Sharlene Wittenburg's farm in Douglas County, Minnesota, with the aid of five young women from the local @4H chapter.  Well done, ladies, and congrats to Drumstick (and pal Wishbone). https://t.co/GuA4IQ2HfQ
Every once in a while, I do what I call "Management by Walking Around." I drop by unannounced in random offices in @USDA. Here's Bill Clay of @USDA_APHIS Wildlife Services. Had a good talk about controlling the feral swine population. https://t.co/RrQoecO5Lj
Big news on agricultural trade: U.S. farm exports hit $140.5 billion for FY2017, the 3rd highest total on record. I'm a grow-it-and-sell-it kinda guy. If American ag producers keep growing it, @USDA will keep helping to sell it. 		The numbers: https://t.co/VVzVtfXADq https://t.co/lmzb4nFZm2
Great to be with you, @VP, to promote @POTUS agenda of historic tax cuts &amp; reforms to create jobs and grow the economy. Good timing, as House passed its version today - good step along the road to success. https://t.co/xpNAaPG5cR
Great news as House passes tax cuts &amp; reforms package. Big step toward end product that will boost economy &amp; create jobs.  Credit to @POTUS for driving the debate and clearing path for historic tax relief and simplification. My statement: https://t.co/QUlFMWXzKQ
At the @WhiteHouse this afternoon w/@VP talking with state and local leaders from CA, NJ &amp; NY about @POTUS agenda to cut taxes and reform the federal tax code.

Happy to address annual conference of @APLU_News this morning. Partnership between @USDA and land grant colleges &amp; universities is long-standing relationship beneficial to students, research &amp; agriculture. https://t.co/rq3NagHCdy
The people in agriculture I talk to -- in California, Iowa, New York, and elsewhere -- want tax cuts and reforms. Most farms operate as small businesses. They want simplification of the tax code and more of their own money to invest in their own families and enterprises. https://t.co/bC5VNgupRg
They've got about 1,000 Holsteins at @KingsDairy and they all wear necklaces that track rumination activity, heat &amp; other factors to tell what‚Äôs happening with certain cows. These are like the FitBits of agriculture - tech savvy. https://t.co/ClDYtnbkfi
The agriculture family out in full force for town hall this morning at @KingsDairy in Schuylerville, NY. W/@RepStefanik, @RepJohnFaso, @RepTenney, heard about tax cuts, deregulation, #FarmBill, school meals, among other topics. https://t.co/x9BmaTz3T6
Talking about future of family farms at @KingsDairy w/@RepStefanik, @RepJohnFaso &amp; @RepTenney. @POTUS efforts on tax cuts &amp; reforms big topics. Farmers shouldn't have to spend big money on lawyers &amp; accountants just to avoid Death Tax to pass on life's work to their children. https://t.co/taXHgbhy0v
Just checking. Yep. They have chocolate milk at @KingsDairy. https://t.co/32g9JWOpeD
Once again, the intersection of agriculture and manufacturing. Milk producers need this machinery and someone has to make it. Touring @KingsDairy with @RepStefanik @RepJohnFaso &amp; @RepTenney in Schuylerville, NY. https://t.co/KsShn4CRQA
Visit to @KingsDairy in Schuylerville, NY brings it all back. I can remember getting up at 4:30 a.m. to milk cows on the family farm and feeling that Holstein tail swipe across my face. https://t.co/xyrOpL8S3v
