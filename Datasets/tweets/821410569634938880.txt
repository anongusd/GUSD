@GovMikeHuckabee @Lrihendry Like you just said it's a horrible revolving door, some newly elected politicians who r not millionaires show their tax returns &amp; run for office, then use the powers of their office to get rich, leave office to get richer &amp; never show their tax returns again  JUST LIKE YOU DID
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews Really?? Any plans Pelosi had would b so boring,  cuz the only really good dirty trickster is not available tonight. Let us know when you will have the Beatles on your show.
@TheRynheart @GOP When he shuts the US down this time can he please also close the WH and his twitter acct.
@GovMikeHuckabee @ShannonBream @FoxNews Will that warp.speed time phenomenon make u care about ppl outside the beltway &amp; stop the blame game. Ppl out here r exhausted watching talking heads point fingers- seems if talking head studio was on fire no one would call 911 until talking heads got last word on blame for fire.
@hogansgoat2423 @deborahann770 @grannyE15 @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Six of one half dozen of the other we all still paid for the plane for a worthless reason.
@grannyE15 @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump I'm wide awake and listening to the truth Melania flew to Mar A Lago on a military plane today, Trump himself said so
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump You ran for president at least twice so I expect you to know that the President, VP &amp; speaker are NEVER allowed to fly commercial cuz of 9-11 &amp; we never put the VP on the same plane with POTUS. Surely you knew that, but it's ok cuz Melania just flew military to Mar A Lago today.
@realDonaldTrump Gosh I'm so confused, I thought everything wrong with the world BT (before Trump), was the fault of politicians elected BT, &amp; everything wrong since was the fault of Democrats &amp; now we're told these children died not because of Democrats, but cuz their own parents made them sick

@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Oops it take POTUS more than 15 minutes to do his comb over and hit the tanning bed, so 15 minutes might have to be extended before he can deal with Nancy and Chuck.
@Acosta @CherylRutledg17 Translation--- oh my tonight I have to share my bed with Trump's secretary of transportation and our pillow talk was supposed to be about Christmas, now it will be about signing up to take classes on how to speak Russian and Chinese
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Apparently it's ok with presidential values for the US government to kill 7 year old children who are loved and wanted , put American military lives at risk who are loved and wanted  in Syria, but to protect unborn children whose parents decided to abort based on medical advice.
@GovMikeHuckabee Uh---one big difference, Google is not owned by Russians
@GovMikeHuckabee So Mike Flynn is your idea of a true patriot, please charter the rest of us patriots a plane to Russia and Turkey cuz we all want the same amount of the patriotic money Flynn got from Turkey and Russia, cuz we all want you to recognize us for our patriotic service to the US
@krassenstein Also same guy who loudly claimed one of the previous occupants of the WH was not born in the US and thus should be evicted from the WH has now put 3 people in the WH who really were NOT born in the US
@GovMikeHuckabee @USPS Good luck with getting USPS to even find your package.  Maybe Fox can fix USPS
@GovMikeHuckabee @TBN Since you get paid for doing these shows, use twitter for free to advertise your show, moved from your home state of Arkansas to Florida to avoid state income tax why should your paid opinion be better than other paid opinions?
@GovMikeHuckabee Depends on if Acosta has a law degree and is subject to ethical rules in the courtroom,  I've seen some pretty outlandish behavior by defendants in courtrooms
@GovMikeHuckabee Kinda hard to remember your mission is to drain the swamp when you're up to your hips in alligators who are playing eat the voters
@GovMikeHuckabee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Agreed, Trump fights back, justified or not--Lying Ted, Little Marco, Low IQ Maxine, but he also starts it, he wasn't a candidate when he did the birther movement against Obama. May be ok with you for ppl to act this way but most of us still teach Christian values to our kids.
@GovMikeHuckabee @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @POTUS He sure didn't help Mitt Romney so maybe Mitt can skip the groveling meeting.
@GovMikeHuckabee @united Maybe your feeling came from brownies that contained Marijuana as it is legal in Colorado. We'll all have to wait and see how the DNC feels Wednesday morning.
@GovMikeHuckabee Agreed- and all US citizens must  be allowed to vote w/o a pole tax or  exact match ID, etc. Evidence shows hand writing changes over time so to have non-experts decide14th amendment rights by making an expert opinion if your current signature matches one done years ago must stop
@GovMikeHuckabee Just following Trump advice to body slam folks
@JustoJSanchez @GovMikeHuckabee Lots of folks believe they are followers of Jesus, and they try to lead their lives as Jesus taught us but most of us know we come up a little short. Only those who grade themselves on a curve think they are perfect in the eyes of Jesus. They forget Jesus doesn't grade on a curve

@NateBell4AR @realDonaldTrump Sen Tom Cotton says GOP Sen Graham is a bald face liar and he never heard and does not remember what Sen Graham heard in same meeting. Either Sen Cotton is lying or his memory is soooo bad he needs to have a health exam
