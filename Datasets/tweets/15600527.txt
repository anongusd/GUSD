Leviticus 27:30 Thus all the title of the land, of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord’s; it is holy to the Lord.
The verse isn’t a response to the tragedy in Parkland, FL. My prayers are with those victims, their families, and all who have suffered because of the evil in this world.
The idea in Numbers 19 is that sin causes death, and the separation between God and humanity. The passage provides a way for the removal of sin, and foreshadows ultimate salvation from sin through Christ's passion and death.
I don't proselytize with additional commentary on the scripture, but given the responses to this verse I think some context is warranted.

While I’m disappointed in today’s outcome, my commitment to provide relief from Obamacare is as strong as ever. 5/x
As we saw this wk, moving bills through the legislative process is hard. But that’s a feature, not a flaw, of our constitutional republic 4/
They’ve rendered their judgement: Obamacare has failed. 3/
My constituents have judged that law, and more than 60 votes I’ve cast to repeal &amp; replace it, through 7 years and 4 election cycles. 2/
I’ve strongly opposed the ACA's mandates, middle-class tax hikes, and expensive one-size-fits-all health insurance plans since day one. 1/
George, 57, from Sumner emailed me: "just received my new healthcare cost. up 71% ... now they want 909 per month with 6500 deductible"
Unfortunately, the ACA broke many more of its promises. Here are 7 Key Promises Obamacare Broke: https://t.co/Fej2O9EseJ https://t.co/qdojXp4BYn
Katherine from Lawrenceville: "The biggest problem with the ACA is that the promise of being able to keep our current covered... was a lie"
Stephanie, mom of 3 in Danville, says her family's deductible went up $6K. "Obamacare should be repealed and taken off the books," she says.
David in Flora writes: "My wife just got her insurance renewal. Her monthly premium will be $1082 every month!!!!" Says ACA "needs to stop!"
"Sally" makes a great point. She should be able to buy a plan that better fits her unique needs, not Obamacare's one-size-fits-all mandates. https://t.co/CJrDIQk6UM
Bradley from Mahomet, another vet, says before ACA he paid $78/mo for his child's coverage...He now pays $167.44/mo for "a much worse plan"
Lisa from Bismark says her "monthly premium has gone from a little over $200 to currently $450" In May she says she'll be forced to pay $678
David: "We should have the choice of the coverage needed, not some dictate from the Federal Government." He said to let @SenatorDurbin know. https://t.co/QMVIlYZyXN
David in Highland, married w/ 2 teens, went from paying $500/m w/ $1,500 deductible to $990/m w/ $12,600 deductible "for far less coverage"
Jan from Neoga paid $254/m for a plan she liked. Now she pays $858/mo for the same policy. Says "ACA will be the demise of the Middle Class"
Larry, a veteran from Bethany, tells me his wife's insurance went from $610/mo to $1,000/mo. Says "something needs to be done about this."
Throughout the day I'm going to share more of these stories about how the ACA has been anything but affordable for many of my constituents.
