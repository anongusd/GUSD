@WWJD303 No one is being denied a thing, if they want the exemption all they have to do is the complete the paperwork @joethepatriotic
@joethepatriotic The case is not about whether nuns qualify for an exemption, they do. It's whether they have to fill out a form to claim it
@joethepatriotic So by your specious #GOPlogic, the #DMV is a tyranny because they "force" you to do paperwork to drive legally
@joethepatriotic Force? The plan the nuns have is already exempted, they just need to fill out a form each year to keep exemption
@joethepatriotic what principles are the nuns renouncing? They fill out a form and get a waiver, just like they do with the IRS for taxes
@joethepatriotic @DougLaMalfa Renouncing what? Paperwork is tyranny? The #GOP wants rape victims to fill out more papers than the nuns will.
