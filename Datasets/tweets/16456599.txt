T. Rowe has held a small stake in Wynn Resorts since 2003. It bought 3M shares of $Wynn stock from Steve Wynn for $175/share
One of the big buyers of Steve Wynn‚Äôs stake is Capital Research and Management. They bought 5M $Wynn shares at $175/shares.
Two institutional investors that already own $Wynn bought Steve Wynn‚Äôs 8 million remaining shares. And Wynn Resorts sold 5.3 billion shares to Galaxy Entertainment - for more than $900M.
In less than 2 months - Steve Wynn has gone from calling sex assault allegations ‚Äúpreposterous‚Äù to resigning as CEO and, now, fully divesting himself of his stake in Wynn Resorts.
