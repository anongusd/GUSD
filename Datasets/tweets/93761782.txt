He was a loyal friend whom I loved dearly, and his life will be an inspiration for young people to serve our nation for generations to come.
I saw firsthand as, together, we led two Senate Committees, the boundless passion John McCain had for our country matched only by his staunch adherence to an honor code that guided his entire life.
Senator John McCain was the bravest person I ever met. He was tested in war in unimaginable circumstances and was fearless in public life. He spoke his mind in the face of powerful forces.

Read about Carl‚Äôs full seven-point plan to reduce the deficit here: http://t.co/Sul55Kqm
‚ÄúI will be back again to discuss 3 more ideas that can reduce the deficit, protect the middle-class and avoid draconian cuts.‚Äù
‚ÄúI hope the Joint Select Committee will look hard at these and the other proposals in my plan as they carry out their difficult task.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe should end these Wall Street loopholes, and I have encouraged the members of the Joint Select Committee to end them.‚Äù
"According to a survey by a magazine covering the hedge fund industry, the top 10 hedge fund managers last year each made at least $440M."
‚Äú[Joint Committee on Taxation says] eliminating the carried interest loophole could reduce the deficit by $20B or more over 10 years.‚Äù
‚ÄúThese special tax breaks impose an unfair burden on American taxpayers, and they contribute significantly to the budget deficit.‚Äù
‚ÄúI cannot see how anybody can explain to working Americans that they must bear a greater tax burden so hedge fund managers get a break.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe second would end the ‚Äòblended rate‚Äô loophole that gives preferential status to income from derivatives trading.‚Äù
‚ÄúOne would end the ‚Äòcarried interest‚Äô loophole that allows hedge fund managers to pay the lower capital gains tax rate on their pay.‚Äù
‚ÄúI want to describe 2 more of my proposals, each dealing with a tax loophole that benefits Wall Street at the expense of working families.‚Äù
‚ÄúI believe the President‚Äôs  proposals are an important step toward serious deficit reduction.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe President has embraced the need to restore significant revenues to reduce the deficit."
Carl‚Äôs on his way back to the Senate floor to deliver his third speech on his plan to reduce the deficit. Watch: c-span.org/Live-Video/C-S‚Ä¶
Read about Carl‚Äôs full seven-point plan to reduce the deficit here: http://t.co/Sul55Kqm
These proposals ‚Äúensure that multinational corporations and wealthy individuals pay the taxes that they owe, just like working Americans."
Legislation introduced with @sensherrodbrown and @clairecmc would clamp down on corporate stock option tax deductions.
‚ÄúClosing the stock option loophole would ‚Ä¶ end an unaffordable federal subsidy for corporate executive pay.‚Äù
Carl‚Äôs Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act ‚Äúwould penalize tax dodging, not legitimate economic activity, and it would help to bring down the deficit.‚Äù
‚ÄúAll of this shifts the tax burden of these tax dodgers onto the backs of honest taxpayers.‚Äù
‚ÄúA single building in the Cayman Islands ‚Ä¶ serves as the mail drop for nearly 19,000 companies incorporated there for tax-dodging purposes.‚Äù
‚ÄúAbuse of offshore tax havens by wealthy U.S. taxpayers costs our treasury $100 billion a year ‚Ä¶ (we) can recover a significant portion.‚Äù
‚ÄúBudget experts tell us that we cannot close our budget gap with spending cuts alone. Revenue must play a role.‚Äù
Carl‚Äôs on his way back to the Senate floor to talk about ways to reduce the deficit. Watch: http://t.co/GfWyCPmr
Read the full text of Carl's statement on his deficit-reduction plan: http://t.co/IxssQ76R
"I've sent a letter .. laying out these seven loopholes that can and should be closed."
"If we simply close these loopholes, we can save over $1 trillion over 10 years."
‚ÄúPast efforts to reduce high deficits have made new revenue a significant part of the equation.‚Äù Reagan: 75 percent revenue increases.
"‚Ä¶ but also avoid devastating cuts to defense, health, education and other programs important to America and its families.‚Äù
Carl: "We can reach our deficit reduction targets and help ensure fiscal stability, while avoiding not only the damaging automatic cuts ‚Ä¶
