@FangedKatipo @Jennyi43 @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump @LifeNewsHQ @LiveAction @LilaGraceRose @spucprolife But we could educate people better on using better forms of birth control so they don' have to get a abortion.
@FangedKatipo @Jennyi43 @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump @LifeNewsHQ @LiveAction @LilaGraceRose @spucprolife Still, that 1 Percent suffers.

@Symbolic_Love @Jennyi43 @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump @LifeNewsHQ @LiveAction @LilaGraceRose @spucprolife I don't think theres a moral problem with abortions, and I feel that with this hot topic women are more pressured then ever.		(BTW this is a really productive debate we are having)
@Jennyi43 @94mazdamiata @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump @LifeNewsHQ @LiveAction @LilaGraceRose @spucprolife You support women giving birth to babys who would immediately die right after birth?
@Jennyi43 @Symbolic_Love @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump @LifeNewsHQ @LiveAction @LilaGraceRose @spucprolife Lets respect our differences before twitters new rules suspend us. SP.
@Jennyi43 @Symbolic_Love @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump @LifeNewsHQ @LiveAction @LilaGraceRose @spucprolife https://t.co/Pq7zGmEqhs
@Symbolic_Love @Jennyi43 @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump @LifeNewsHQ @LiveAction @LilaGraceRose @spucprolife I think that if there is more sexual education we could help prevent abortions used as birth control, but it still does not give other people the right to tell women what they can and cant do.
@94mazdamiata @Jennyi43 @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump @LifeNewsHQ @LiveAction @LilaGraceRose @spucprolife What if the baby has bilateral renal agenesis or anencephal? It will not survive, and have a intra-uterine fetal death.		What if the mother has dangerously high blood pressures called pre-eclampsia, she could have seizures and organ damage resulting in her death or injury.
@KipGross1 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Ummmmm https://t.co/ewdXBLNxWD

@Jennyi43 @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump @LifeNewsHQ @LiveAction @LilaGraceRose @spucprolife What if a minor got pregnant from sexual crimes?
@Jennyi43 @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump @LifeNewsHQ @LiveAction @LilaGraceRose @spucprolife Sometimes women have to have a abortion or they could die.
@Jennyi43 @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump @LifeNewsHQ @LiveAction @LilaGraceRose @spucprolife Thank you for politely showing your opinion, many don't do that. 	But what if its medically impossible to give birth and you are pregnant. Not everybody can get a C section. 	What if the baby has a problem in the womb and if it was born it would always be on life support.
@Jennyi43 @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump @LifeNewsHQ @LiveAction @LilaGraceRose @spucprolife Women have a moral right to decide what to do with their bodies.		The right to abortion is vital for gender equality.		Women who are sexually assaulted, Victims of Rape, or forcefully made Pregnant, now have to keep a baby that was forced on them.
