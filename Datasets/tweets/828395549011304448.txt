@BarbraStreisand Well thats not intelligent
@LindseyGrahamSC Because the Supreme Court has not interpreted the Constitution to mandate automatic birthright citizenship, the Congress can pass a law to correct the current misguided and incorrect policy of automatically granting citizenship to children of illegal immigrants.
@LindseyGrahamSC The Supreme Court has never held that the children of illegal immigrants born in the United States are automatically citizens.
@LindseyGrahamSC The history of the 14th Amend. makes clear that the language ‚Äúsubject to the jurisdiction thereof‚Äù meant a citizen could not owe allegiance to any other foreign power. This excludes illegal immigrants who are in defiance of U.S. jurisdiction and are citizens of a foreign power.
@LindseyGrahamSC The plain meaning of the 14th Amendment means that one must BOTH be born in United States AND be subject to the jurisdiction thereof. Since there are two explicit requirements, they both cannot be met by simply being born on U.S. soil.
