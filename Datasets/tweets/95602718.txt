@shannonwmbc @SenTedCruz @SenSasse Naw, it's just history. Also the New Testament. Christianity went completely off the rails even before the last Apostle passed into the next life. But even among those who claim to read/have read the Bible I've yet to find any who know the slightest thing about what it all means.
@shannonwmbc @SenTedCruz @SenSasse Actually it's the Xtians, you know, the false claimants to the name of Jesus, who in their abject ignorance worship the horned, false god representing Nimrod, the founder of Babylon. His cult took complete control of Xtianity by 325 AD and took over Europe by 721 AD. #MemeFail

@pcarlton29 @Catlady628 @stucam7771 In fact, a person can't know what the meaning of the term "antichrist" is unless they first know what the definition of the title "Christ" is &amp; I haven't found a single Xtian who has the correct understanding of the title "Christ" as given throughout the entire Bible. Clergy lies
@pcarlton29 @Catlady628 @stucam7771 Trump does however fit many of the criteria of the evangelicals delusional vision of an individual personage to be "THE antichrist" but as their delusion is exactly that-a delusion, they got it all wrong and fell for the one they try to warn about. Poetic justice.
@pcarlton29 @Catlady628 @stucam7771 Trump is just the "Little Horn" on the 4th Beast in one of Daniel's prophetic visions. Anti-Christ or Antichrist however you want to spell it is a completely different thing than all the churches teach if one goes by scripture &amp; it's not any of the various biblical beasts.
@pcarlton29 @Catlady628 @stucam7771 Trump's not "the anti-christ". There is no personage in the Bible who is "THE anti-christ", that's all a wild misinterpretation of the scriptures by the evangelical clergy that they took from delusional misinterpretations dating all the way back to the early "Holy Roman Empire".

@LeftProud @leeannkendall @ProudResister And you still failed to address the fact that in no line did I or the article I linked to even remotely suggest that Trump is "the Antichrist", as you put it. You're definitely a Troll with nothing to add. Your only purpose is to muddy the water and so I'ma mute you now.
@LeftProud @leeannkendall @ProudResister Then you will remain as uninformed as you were when you first trolled my tweet.
@LeftProud @leeannkendall @ProudResister You clearly have no idea about the Revelation of Jesus Christ. Whatever this "Revelations" thing you speak of is, well that's your own problem.
@CBSNews @davidlitt Anyone who can be "persuaded" by Trump for any reason in any way shouldn't be left alone to care for themself.

@brianstelter @GlennKesslerWP He can correct his piece by saying instead that it's "a year of unprecedented deception during which Trump increased the frequency of his lies until it became difficult to number them on a daily basis..." That would correct his article to reflect the reality of the truth as it is
@brianstelter @GlennKesslerWP Then he's wrong on the second part-Trump has always been 100% unmoored from the truth. He (Trump) has never been moored to the truth in the first place so the statement that he (Trump) has become "increasingly unmoored from the truth..." is itself predicated on a lie.
