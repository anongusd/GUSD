Thank you to @ruthmglenn @quasimado @robvalentedvpa  Dave Thomas and Susan B. Sorenson for joining us today and discussing the intersection of guns and domestic violence, and thank you to everyone who joined us today! #AdvoChat
It's Q&amp;A time! What questions do you have for the panel? #AdvoChat
DV victims using guns for self-defense? "You're asking someone to hurt someone that they love." @ruthmglenn #AdvoChat
DV victims using guns for self-defense? "It's a false sense of security," says Dave Thomas, IACP #AdvoChat
Research published 20 years ago: purchasing a gun and bringing it into home increase risk of homicide and suicide for women. Susan B. Sorenson #AdvoChat
@ruthmglenn  to Susan B. Sorenson: Oftentimes we are asked whether victims and survivors of domestic violence should get guns to protect themselves. What does the research tell us about whether or not guns do or do not make victims of domestic violence safer? #AdvoChat
If you want to follow instance where there is an intersection of DV and firearms, check out #DisarmDV.
Lethality assessment tools are another best practice for identifying at-risk cases. #AdvoChat
@robvalentedvpa is pointing out the process in Baltimore is also an example of a best practice model for law enforcement to work with victim advocates and survivors to get them to safety and firearms out of the hands of abusers. #AdvoChat
RT @AvalonCenterTN: I hope #Congress  gets on board with adding boyfriend that doesn‚Äôt live with you to the code for the gun restrictions w‚Ä¶
@AvalonCenterTN The Lautenberg Amendment, 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 922(g)(9)
In NYC, gun violence has decreased 85% since 1993. Everything they do with the people they serve actively participate in a coordinate community response. #AdvoChat
@ruthmglenn to Dave Thomas: Do you have any examples of a jurisdiction that is having success or using what you would consider to be best practices in enforcing domestic violence and firearms laws? #AdvoChat
States are closing loopholes like "the boyfriend loophole" because of Congress' lack of action in this arena. @robvalentedvpa #AdvoChat
Federal law about firearms hasn't changed since 1996, and so states are way ahead of the feds in terms of protecting victims. #AdvoChat
@ruthmglenn to @robvalentedvpa: Can you please speak to the ways that state and federal laws differ around guns and domestic violence and offer any suggestions that you may have to help both survivors and advocates better navigate these differences in policy? #AdvoChat
We have a culture that enables abuse. @robvalentedvpa #AdvoChat
[An abuser] is a domestic terrorist. --Dave Thomas, IACP #AdvoChat
80% of incidents involved a gun were male on female; many were boyfriend/girlfriend. 2/3 of the times they were used to threaten the person. The use of a firearm increased fear 3-fold in victims. -Susan B. Sorenson #AdvoChat
@ruthmglenn to Susan B. Sorenson: Through your research, what did you learn about how the presence of guns can heighten fear and compliance among victims and reduce willingness to leave or otherwise end the relationship? #AdvoChat
@ruthmglenn reminding us about #SurvivorSpeaks, which allows survivors to voice their experiences and educate communities (including the media) about the reality of domestic violence. #AdvoChat
The framing in these stories is lacking, and it's because we lack resources to educate the media. @ruthmglenn #AdvoChat
When people are reporting these stories, they need to look at the bigger picture. Ask: what kind of violence was present before this one incident? what kinds of law are in these communities? did things work as they should? @quasimado #AdvoChat
@ruthmglenn to @quasimado : How can the media work to center and uplift the voices and stories of domestic violence victims and survivors in the conversation about domestic violence? #AdvoChat
The systems is meaningless if people don't have to submit records. #FixNICS will help close some of these gaps. @robvalentedvpa 	More on #FixNICS: https://t.co/dEQgfFQ13l #AdvoChat
It's 2018, and people can still avoid a background check with a private sale. That needs to change. --Dave Thomas, IACP #AdvoChat
@ruthmglenn to Dave Thomas: What would you say are the biggest barriers that law enforcement agencies are currently facing in terms of enforcing state laws regarding the surrender of firearms? #AdvoChat
This patchwork of laws we have makes it way too easy for abusers to access firearms. @robvalentedvpa #AdvoChat
@ruthmglenn to @robvalentedvpa : Can you speak to the variability in state firearm removal policies that allow certain loopholes to persist? #AdvoChat
We need [firearms] laws with teeth to them. --Dave Thomas, IACP, responding to @robvalentedvpa 's point about challenges facing the system. #AdvoChat
@quasimado brought up how laws across the country are inconsistent and often not enforced. @robvalentedvpa is chiming in w/ the fact that there is no structure or resources for law enforcement to remove firearms from those under a #DVPO. #AdvoChat
Most of the research doesn‚Äôt take into account how the [firearms] law was implemented. --Susan B. Sorenson #AdvoChat
Access to the firearm is a key thing, and we know this well. -- Susan B. Sorenson #AdvoChat https://t.co/TlgIUxD7PA
@ruthmglenn to Susan B. Sorenson: What can we learn from the data about both the risk factors as well as the effectiveness of policies that prohibit abusers from purchasing or possessing guns at reducing intimate partner homicide? #AdvoChat
I try to keep the numbers and the people connected. Each data point represents a person who has struggled -- and possibly didn't make it. -- Susan B. Sorenson #AdvoChat
RT @AvalonCenterTN: I know it just started but I love how this webinar is set up with live web cams and interactiveness @NCADV #AdvoChat
Law enforcement is the conduit between the community and the legal system. -Dave Thomas, IACP #AdvoChat
As a journalist, my role is to take people's stories and give them a wider audience. @quasimado #AdvoChat
@robvalentedvpa is talking about how legislation and policy can keep victims safe. Getting systems the resources they need, putting funding and support behind the issue, etc. #AdvoChat
@ruthmglenn is asking the panel our first question: What role do you and those in your field play in bolstering our nation‚Äôs response to the intersection of guns and domestic violence? #AdvoChat
RT @jemappellelis: @NCADV #advochat My story is much like Ruth Glenn‚Äôs.
@ruthmglenn is sharing her story as a survivor of domestic violence and gun violence, and why the intersection of DV and firearms is such a critical policy issue for NCADV. #AdvoChat
Susan B. Sorenson, trained in sociology, psychology, and public health, is a Professor of Social Policy at the University of Pennsylvania where she also is the Executive Director of the Ortner Center on Violence &amp; Abuse in Relationships. #AdvoChat

Rob (Roberta) Valente @robvalentedvpa is a Policy Consultant for @NCADV, with specialized interests in firearms, federal domestic violence laws and interventions, and tribal issues relating to domestic violence. #AdvoChat
Melissa Jeltsen @quasimado  is a senior reporter at HuffPost, where she writes about #GBV. Her recent work has highlighted #DV victims who are incarcerated for self-defense, how to prevent intimate partner homicides, and the role of firearms in abusive relationships. #AdvoChat

#VoicesRising ANNOUNCEMENT: Due to an emergency, the "Advocating for Healthy Relationships" workshop at 4pm in the Narragansett Ballroom has been cancelled.
An attendee just asked when the #DisarmDV website will be live. When @KellyEWRoskam said we're hoping Phase 1 will launch at the end of Oct. 2018, the workshop attendees got VERY excited! #VoicesRising
By informing advocates and survivors about the letter of the law in an accessible way, #DisarmDV  ensures that they are speaking the court's language -- literally! #VoicesRising
Basic questions like "what kind of domestic violence restraining orders are available in my state" can be answered by the #DisarmDV website. #VoicesRising
There's very little consistency across states when it comes to the process of getting protection orders and relinquishing firearms. #DisarmDV #VoicesRising
Having info is the most important first step in taking steps to prevent violence. Gaps become evident via projects like the #DisarmDV website. #VoicesRising
By breaking it down state by state, policy makers can examine what neighbors are doing across state lines and potentially point to it as a model. #DisarmDV #VoicesRising
#DisarmDV also walks people through a very tricky legal process (obtaining protection orders) and breaks it down state by state on how to get one, including how to ask for the courts to order a firearm removed from an abusive partner.  #VoicesRising
Information on protection orders by state are important for multidisciplinary teams to develop responses, new policy, and even statutes. #DisarmDV #VoicesRising
The #DisarmDV workshop is underway! First question is to Adelyn RE: data found on the website. How do survivors+advocates use it? #VoicesRising
The @Disarm_DV project will be discussed at a workshop @ 10:30am in Providence Ballroom I &amp; IV. Join @NCADV and @EFSGV  for an overview of the #DisarmDV website launching in Oct. https://t.co/kgTfFCBH4I

Thank you to Jason Emmanuel for joining us today and discussing the prosecution of DV cases, and thank you to everyone who joined us today! #AdvoChat
Remember: Though you may not always see eye to eye with your prosecutors and there will be times of disagreement and frustration on the part of the advocate, we‚Äôre all on the same team working toward the same goal of ending DV in our communities! #AdvoChat
working with survivors from underserved populations, fighting outdated perceptions of DV, lack of cooperation from the victim.  (2/2) #AdvoChat
Common challenges prosecutors face: Lack of evidence, determining primary aggressor when no witnesses, efforts by abuser to undermine the case, changing contact info for survivors and witnesses, (1/2) #AdvoChat
There‚Äôs many ways to support survivors during a trial, and Jason is sharing some great best practices with advocates right now. #AdvoChat
Jason is reviewing how advocates can support survivors during and after charging decisions are made. #AdvoChat
We‚Äôre now examining what advocates can do during the warrant application phase. #AdvoChat
Jason is now discussing how advocates can help law enforcement while preserving confidentiality. #AdvoChat
The stages of a criminal prosecution: law enforcement response, warrant application, charging decision, probable cause hearing, status/pre-trial conferences, service of subpoenas, final pre-trial conference/motion hearing, trial, sentencing, &amp; post-conviction/appeal. #AdvoChat
"As prosecutors, we seek to strike the necessary balance between accountability, survivor needs and wishes, AND the safety of both survivors and the community at large." Jason Emmanuel #AdvoChat
The St. Clair State‚Äôs Attorney Office Mantra: ‚ÄúThere is no criminal justice without social justice and there is no social justice without criminal justice.‚Äù #AdvoChat
The role of the prosecutor is not just to seek convictions but to seek justice in the many varying forms that may manifest. #AdvoChat
In 2017‚Äôs Q1, the State Attorney office charged 142 DV-related offenses. 46 were declined and 20 were sent back for further investigation ‚Äì an aggressive 68% are formally charged!  #AdvoChat
Domestic violence &amp; related offenses are an ongoing challenge for St. Clair County, just as they are for many other jurisdictions across the state and nation. #AdvoChat

Thank you to Courtney Chasse for joining us today and discussing change implementation, and thank you to everyone who joined us today! #AdvoChat
After completing your recommendations, meet with team members and chiefs to review report, discuss findings/concerns, review recommendations, and discuss next steps. #AdvoChat
For each finding in your assessment, offer a thorough recommendation for improvement. These can result in checklists, supplements, topic trainings, and more. #AdvoChat
One thing the team noticed in their list of findings was how information was missing or not included in police reports, leading to DA‚Äôs pleading down pleas with offenders. The team had the DA explain to officers &amp; state the importance of documentation in every report. #AdvoChat
After you finish mapping, you can build your list of assessment findings. It‚Äôs important to note good things as well as bad! #AdvoChat
The place to start with your best practice assessment is mapping law enforcement‚Äôs current response from start to finish. #AdvoChat
Before you begin your best practice assessment, you will need to educate yourself, prepare and organize, and educate the team. #AdvoChat
Systems support involves getting people from all systems involved in the process: 911/dispatch, law enforcement, victim witness advocates, pretrial services, DA‚Äôs office, probation, batterer intervention programs, child protective services, and judges. #AdvoChat

Thank you to all our panelists for joining us today and discussing creating sustained cultural change and making the #MeToo movement last, and thank you to everyone who joined us today!
Question from the audience: What role can the education system play in preventing domestic and sexual violence?
The panel is now taking specific questions from our webinar audience, starting with how DV and SA orgs can work together to best serve survivors and victims.
It's important for men to be able to talk to other men about this. @quasimado
Men need to check our privilege and listen. -- Aaron @WithoutViolence
Too often men feel shame as victims and survivors. It's a silencing thing. Having voices come forward helps more male survivors to reach out for resources. -- Julie @RalianceOrg
#SurvivorSpeaks https://t.co/GLv3P12Vi2
1) Stop harassing us. 2) There's violence men have experienced as part of being raised in this culture that they need to process and come to terms with. -- Jessica @SafeSpacesDC
Men can play a role by beginning to believe. -- @ruthmglenn
Now @quasimado is asking our panel what role men play in #MeToo.
#SurvivorSpeaks https://t.co/PFJLS1arvc
Who is being left out of #MeToo? Young ppl, women of color, disabled, unemployed, queer, trans, DV vics, sex workers, homeless ppl, men, undocumented workers.
@quasimado is asking our panel who is being left out of the #MeToo conversation.
RT @speak766: ‚ÄúAccountability and culture change means believing survivors‚Äù @NCADV #metoo #SAAM
We need to center the experiences of those most marginalized -- sex workers, homeless women, women of color, transgendered, unemployed, etc. -- Jessica @SafeSpacesDC
@quasimado is asking Jessica of @SafeSpacesDC: How did the conversation about intersectional feminism evolve as a result of the #MeToo movement?
Part of culture change is saying "We believe you" first, and then work backwards from there. @ruthmglenn
RT @speak766: ‚ÄúIf we are to continue to change this national narrative, we must have people in power who are not denying what‚Äôs happening‚Äù‚Ä¶
‚ÄúIf we are to continue to change this national narrative, we must have people in power who are not denying what‚Äôs happening.‚Äù -- @ruthmglenn
So many things have to go right for a survivors to come forward and report. -- Julie @RalianceOrg
RT @couragecentral: Aaron Polkey: ‚ÄúNothing happens in isolation‚Äù @quasimado @ruthmglenn @NCADV @WithoutViolence
@quasimado asks @ruthmglenn: How has the #MeToo movement influenced the national conversation on the importance of believing victims?
RT @speak766: ‚ÄúSustainable culture change means people looking out for each other‚Äù - Julie on creating change after #metoo @RalianceOrg @NC‚Ä¶
Social media has given us a way to call someone out individually where they respond. -- Aaron @WithoutViolence
@quasimado asks Aaron from @WIthoutVIolence: How does social media impact our ability to shift culture and how can advocates and orgs use it to further their efforts?
Culture change is a long term process. #MeToo is an amazing moment to accelerate this change. -- Julie @RalianceOrg
@quasimado asks Julie from @RalianceOrg: What does sustainable culture change look like in the #MeToo era?
The legal system isn't equipped to deal with accountability, because the legal system asks "Who needs to be punished?" while accountability asks "What does the survivor need to feel safe?" -- Jessica @SafeSpacesDC
The Safe Bar Collective is a program working to end gendered violence and discrimination in nightlife. @SafeSpacesDC
It's important that nightlife staff are equipped to recognize warning signs and know how to safely intervene. -- Jessica @SafeSpacesDC
@quasimado is asking Jessica about a report that indicates workers in restaurants and bars have the highest claims of sexual harassment by women. How have stats like this influenced the work Jessica is doing at @SafeSpacesDC?
RT @OCEconnects: Great examples on how to support sexual violence victims in the workplace @WithoutViolence @apolkey @NCADV https://t.co/WC‚Ä¶
Employers are charged with not only responding to harassment but also creating a culture from Day One On The Job that supports survivors and promotes accountability. It's a question of the workplace's values. -- Aaron @WithoutViolence
Aaron recommends this article from @Forbes: How To Hold Employers Accountable During The #TimesUp and #MeToo Movements https://t.co/rZ0LJFoHlq
@quasimado asks Aaron from @WithoutViolence: How can we hold employers accountable and what can workplaces do to cultivate a culture of support, respect and equity?
RT @OCEconnects: #MeToo  looking forward to @NCADV webinar Creating sustained culture change during #SAAM2018 Thank you @quasimado @Without‚Ä¶
RT @speak766: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs continue to carry #metoo forward and include everyone who has experienced this, including domestic violence survivors‚Äù‚Ä¶
We still have difficulty understanding we live in a patriarchal society, because that's what enables this violence against women to continue. -- @ruthmglenn
This is an opportunity to talk about everyday consent. --Julie Patrick @RalianceOrg
@quasimado asks Julie from @RalianceOrg: Is our understanding of sexual consent broken, and how do we fix it?
We have to look at the situation comprehensively if we're going to come up with a comprehensive solution. -- Jessica Raven @SafeSpacesDC
It's important to remind people that sexual harassment is just one piece of gender based violence. --Aaron Polkey @WithoutViolence
Sexual violence is often used as a tool to assert power and control by abusers, but DV victims tend to get left behind in the #MeToo conversation. -- @ruthmglenn
DV victims have been marginalized within the #MeToo conversation. -- @ruthmglenn
@quasimado asks @ruthmglenn: How do domestic violence survivor stories fit into the #MeToo movement?
This simple hashtag #MeToo gave people permission to talk about it. -- @ruthmglenn
@quasimado is asking our panel what the #MeToo hashtag means to them.
Jessica Raven is a survivor, mother, organizer, and the Exec Dir for @SafeSpacesDC, a DC-based grassroots org working to build safer public spaces by centering the experiences of those at the margins.

RT @speak766: Great webinar on the Take A Stand for healthy teen relationships curriculum @NCADV #TAS4HTR #TeenDatingViolenceAwarenessmonth
Thank you to everyone who attended our #TAS4HTR webinar today! Be sure to check out the entire project at https://t.co/nrPCXUQXyD.
We created Aye to be gender neutral and didn't assign a gender to the robot in an attempt to be as gender inclusive as possible. We may, in the future, have an opportunity to create additional lessons to address things like inclusiveness. #TAS4HTR
The entire curriculum takes ~16 hours. It depends on whether you are utilizing middle vs high school students. The last module can be short, or very long depending on your students. #TAS4HTR
What questions do you have for Gretchen and/or Emily about the #TAS4HTR curriculum?
If you are an educator interested in being an official pilot for this curriculum, click here: https://t.co/Razs0UF78s #TAS4HTR
We have created easy levels of commitment for educators who are interested in the Take A Stand FOR Healthy Relationships Curriculum and look forward to receiving feedback and improving the curriculum. #TAS4HTR
In order to improve what we have created, we need educators nationwide to pilot the curriculum in sections or entirety to be sure that it is worthwhile to educators and students. #TAS4HTR
The Action Tool Kit provides educators and students with dynamic ways to spread awareness and promote healthy relationships. #TAS4HTR
The #TAS4HTR curriculum ends with students being challenged to Take A Stand FOR Healthy Relationships by implementing the TAS Action Tool Kit in their school or community.
What to expect from #TAS4HTR Curriculum Lessons: *General guidelines and steps with encouragement to make lessons fit classroom and situational needs *Extensions based on student interest and time
What to expect from #TAS4HTR Curriculum Lessons: *Mix of direct instruction, small group activities, discussion, creative expression, student choice, reading and writing *Middle school and high school options (1/2)
Activities within the educator guide also comes with any handouts/worksheets needed for the lesson. #TAS4HTR
The lessons are aligned with BOTH the National Health Standards as well as Common Core standards so that schools can integrate the curriculum in a variety of classrooms. #TAS4HTR
We have included middle school and high school options within the educator guide which allows teachers to choose activities that fit the needs of their particular group. #TAS4HTR
Each lesson within the educator guide includes step by step instructions for teachers, required materials, time requirements, essential questions for the modules, standards and student objectives. #TAS4HTR
We included the same intro lesson in each module to help educators or advocates prep students to talk about a difficult and sensitive topic. #TAS4HTR
By the end of Module 6, Aye has developed friendships, observed positive and negative examples within relationships, and taken steps to take a stand for healthy relationships at the high school. #TAS4HTR
Throughout the modules, Aye, further develops their understanding of emotions and relationships by attending a local high school. Aye attends class, interacts with teens, and writes for the school newspaper. #TAS4HTR
The animation is helpful in aiding students in the development of healthy relationship skills, especially for younger students in middle school. #TAS4HTR
The story of Aye begins each of the modules and allows students to watch an AI learn and deal with the same topics they are covering in their class. #TAS4HTR
Together with @verbalplsvisual, NCADV developed the story of Aye, who within the storyline, is the most emotional capable robot ever created. ü§ñ #TAS4HTR
While each module covers a different topic, we have structure each of the 6 modules to have consistency in the types of resources available. These include module animation, program intro lesson plan and an educator guide for each module. #TAS4HTR
Then moving on to the development of their own healthy relationships, the reality of teen dating abuse and what advocating and Taking A Stand may look like in their school or community. (2/2) #TAS4HTR
The modules build on each other both in content and in skills, first focusing on the development of emotional intelligence and understanding the impact of external influences. (1/2) #TAS4HTR
Ideally these modules would be completed as a whole but they have been designed to be able to stand alone to honor the needs of the educator/advocate/particular situation. #TAS4HTR
The curriculum is structured around 6 topics (what we call modules) that build upon each other to help students develop the skills it takes to develop healthy relationships themselves and advocate for others‚Äô relationships. #TAS4HTR
The scope and sequence of the curriculum was created with the understanding that the needs of educators will vary greatly and so will the extent to which an educator may implement the lessons. #TAS4HTR
https://t.co/nrPCXUQXyD includes the full curriculum, resources for educators and teens, how to get help, and an animated component to each of the modules.
Emily, the #TAS4HTR curriculum developer, is now going through the website (https://t.co/nrPCXUQXyD) and curriculum.
We are now entering the testing and evaluation phase of the project and are working to secure a number of pilots in different parts of the country. We‚Äôll be using the info and feedback obtained during the next several months to improve upon and expand the project. #TAS4HTR
RT @speak766: 1.5 million high school students are physically abused by dating partners every year @NCADV #TeenDatingViolenceAwarenessmonth
The #TAS4HTR curriculum took over a year to develop and launch. All of the modules are available now and their full release coincides with #TeenDVMonth.
We also wanted the overall message to be a positive, proactive one, so emphasizing learning about and advocating FOR healthy relationships rather than ‚Äúcombating violence.‚Äù #TAS4HTR
We wanted to expand the reach to younger teens, so we created lessons and information for both middle and high school aged teens and their educators. #TAS4HTR
After several conversations, we decided to create an easily accessible resource that would serve as a guide to conversations already happening b/n educators and their students. #TAS4HTR
NCADV held several focus groups with teens, educators, and #DV advocates early on in the project to test the direction of the project and gather info from them about what they thought the curriculum should include. #TAS4HTR
With the collective reach of both @NCADV and @DiscoveryEd, we expect to reach thousands of educators across the country. Since its recent release in Oct 2017, the response has been overwhelming. #TAS4HTR
As a result, we collaborated with @DiscoveryEd and sough funding from @VZFoundation to create a free, national standards-aligned resource for educators on this topic. #TAS4HTR
We also struggled to find information on this topic that was geared towards younger teens. #TAS4HTR
As we dug deeper, we found that while there were many good resources out there, most were hard to find, some seemed difficult to implement, and others came at a cost to educators. #TAS4HTR
The project came about a few years ago as a result of hearing from a number of educators across the country who were searching for a curriculum on healthy relationships and teen domestic violence. #TAS4HTR
Our webinar today is getting started! We‚Äôre joined today by Gretchen Shaw, NCADV Assoc Director, and Emily Treas, #TAS4HTR Curriculum Writer.

Thank you to Mark Wynn for teaching us about strangulation and its motive + impact today, and thank you to everyone who joined us today!
What is SAID during a strangulation must be documented. It will help the DA prove intent!
Outward trauma may not be visible. Look/listen for hoarseness + loss of voice, light headed, difficulty swallowing, among other signs.
Victims may not understand the danger of strangulation and may be reluctant to seek medical attention.
Strangulation can be hard to prove. A lack of visible injury doesn't mean NO injury, doesn't mean there AREN'T signs/symptoms, and it doesn't mean there WASN'T impairment of breathing/blood circulation.
Why is strangulation significant in #DV? B/c it symbolizes an abuser's extreme use of power and control. https://t.co/wvq740Uajj
Strangulation is NOT the same as choking. Strangulation is a form of asphyxia characterized by closure of the blood vessels and/or air passages of the neck as a result of external pressure on the neck.
Surviving victims of strangulation assault are 750% more likely of becoming a homicide victim. https://t.co/6k1htJ0i5L
If you need to leave today's webinar early, don't stress about what you might miss. We'll be sending the recording around to all participants!
Our apologies for the inconvenience -- we're starting over to make sure everyone hears and gets the info they need!
And we're back! https://t.co/EH0AU52rfE
Apologies for technical difficulties -- we're working on getting the challenge resolved and will start again really soon!
RT @speak766: Strangulation has been a commonly missed crime in the context of #DomesticViolence @NCADV webinar
Today's webinar participants will have an in-depth understanding of strangulation's lethality, IDing the signs + symptoms, getting the right documents ready for the DA, and interviewing a victim after strangulation.
Today's webinar is all about the #motive and #impact of #strangulation, featuring guest presenter + NCADV board member, Mark Wynn!
