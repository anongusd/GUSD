We've tried many. I wouldn't say we've exhausted any @SandyDarity
Lead was the third paragraph &amp; there to show why broad policies aren't only answer either @SandyDarity.
Point on social insurance is it's one way we provide (to some extent) the things wealth can buy @SandyDarity, not that it's adequate as is
I didn't order any options &amp; said reparations isn't any more radical than "socialist" policies needed to close gaps.  @SandyDarity
True, recs I mention are not a solution to racial wealth gap, but address other holes in the system @SandyDarity
Also said we should be willing to exhaust every possible option. That does not exclude reparations @SandyDarity
.@SandyDarity , along w/sustained commitment to eliminating racial economic disparities .One or the other still leaves gaping hole.(2/2)
.@SandyDarity the heart of the point I was making is at end of 5th paragraph: combo of broad &amp; racially targeted policies is needed (1/2)
