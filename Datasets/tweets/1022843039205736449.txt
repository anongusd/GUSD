@NancyPelosi @RepCummings Americans can see how the who media in the country are covering up for Democrats instead for the media to exposed the bad things that happened under Obama administration to Americans, and the intelligence agencies also to investigate they rather turns they eyes down
@NancyPelosi @RepCummings Americans if you can investigate well, the answer is simple under Obama administration they use state money to buy the media and the intelligence agencies so that they become loyal to the Democrats, that is why if the DOJ will investigate the intelligence agencies well surprise
@NancyPelosi @RepCummings Americans please ask yourself why is the intelligence agencies so loyal to the Democrats and the media, under Clinton and Bush administration the intelligence agencies and the media were not loyal to any party but why under Obama administration then it change.
@NancyPelosi @RepCummings Nancy Pelosi I hope you understand the term corruption well, because Trump do not use state money he use his own money, but in your case Obama use state money to buy the media and the intelligence agencies that is corruption, using state money is corruption
@NancyPelosi @RepCummings Nancy Pelosi tell Americans the corruption that happened under Obama administration what have you and your fellow Democrats done to stop the corruption, Americans have seen how Obama use state money to buy the media and the intelligence agencies to do dirty work for Democrats
