One of the hard to quantify elements of a business decision is the sense that the people you‚Äôre trying to make a deal with just may become an endless haggling harassment. That you‚Äôll never get to peace and agreement. https://t.co/NWugmh1sjM
I respected the essential tax argument but man, all those jobs, all that dynamism ‚Äî was there really no way to make it happen? This is a loss to the city. https://t.co/JKpR7KxKR9
But Amazon has stunned by pulling out. 25,000 jobs lost, billions in construction gone. And those who fought the deal now own it.  That is not the safe spot. No moral here but suspect Fear of Surprising Success will become a real calculation. End. 5. Or 6.
Amazon in New York ‚Äî the safe political spot was to oppose the deal while knowing it would go through. You got credit for opposing a billionaire titan who got too big a tax break from city and state. 4
Scottish independence the same ‚Äî those who stand strongly for it do not seem eager to call a second referendum ‚Äî because it could pass. And they‚Äôd have to manage and execute it. 3.
The Brexist politicians, many of them, never thought it would pass, but got credit for idealistically pushing it. Then it passed, and they panicked. That‚Äôs the not-safe place, when the thing you‚Äôre for passes. Then you own it. 2.
The Amazon story has me thinking of a dynamic I see a lot now in politics. The safe spot, the political sweet spot, is to be for something, on moral or ethical grounds, that you know will never pass. Or against, for same reasons, a thing that will. 1.

6. ...knowing you had every right to protest or support a propery tax increase, or something happening in the local schools.  I always thought there would have to be local newspapers because the appetite for local news would stay broad.

4. Is there less hunger now for local news?  Less of a market?  Years ago you read your local newspapers for school sports coverage, what‚Äôs on sale at Safeway, maybe the comics or cartoons. But you also read them because it was part of your job as a citizen.
3. ...or how it‚Äôs produced but think they do because they saw a movie.  All much rehashed.  But there is something else in this area, a question.  And I do not know the answer.  It has to do with what I‚Äôm thinking may be a larger detaching from the local.
2. The crisis of local newspapers is connected to and the product of many things, all of them famously known. The rise of the internet, the consequent collapse of the advertising model, the arrival of corporate saviors who know nithing about journalism...

2. Agca told the pope he feared the Virgin Mary would take vengeance on him. The pope told him no, she only wants to love him, and explained some Catholic theology.  Agca, freed years later, came back to Rome and laid flowers at John Paul‚Äôs tomb. https://t.co/2Hb9Kgalh5
1. This picture captures one of the great moments of the 20th century.  It is Mehmet Ali Agca meeting in his prison cell with the man he shot, Pope John Paul. John Paul had forgiven him after the 1981 assassination attempt, and called him his ‚Äúbrother.‚Äù https://t.co/aZvOJ9M5C1

If you are still nearby, you know those kids. Cops and responders, you‚Äôve seen them. If you have not already, go knock on the door. Help. The end. 6
Normally they go to the neighbors. But the neighbors are gone. The kids are alone, with the tv. ‚ÄúKiller storm‚Äù ‚Äúdeadly flooding.‚Äù  And here is what I want to say. 5
One of the kids is in diapers, maybe one is four and going wild, one is six and has a pain in his stomach and putting towels under the door. And they can‚Äôt wake mama. 4
Mom‚Äôs asleep, dad‚Äôs not there. But the tv‚Äôs always on. The kids are picking up the words and the fear but there‚Äôs no grownup to do the job, get it together, evacuate. Or buy water and milk and bread. 4
This is not ‚Äòwrong‚Äô: they‚Äôre trying to help, reporting a story, maybe the drama will prove realistic and they saved lives. But this is what I think about. There are little kids with no fully functioning parents, or grandparents. 3
Our public media warn and counsel. As days pass their language becomes more heightened. Killer storm, potentially catastrophic, deadly, winds like we‚Äôve never seen, evacuate. 2
Every time a big storm‚Äôs coming I have the same thought. Here I share it. 1.

to have a conversation, not an argument. But also mean not to upset. It is my sense now history in America needs to be protected. /15?
Kids -- all of us -- need more to look up to. (Many possible subjects have previously been suggested here.) I always mean here /14?
But to the extent possible leave history alone, dont tear down or deface. That is a shame. And: build more statues. /12
Leave the statues up and tell the story, all aspects, as you pass. And ponder what grave moral wrongs we might be allowing/ignoring now./11?
Imperfectly but in the end constructively we held together and stayed America. This is a lot to talk about, pass down, explain. /10
And both sides afterward held together -- imperfectly, sometimes uncomfortably. The leaders of the South largely attempted reconciliation /9
that was right. An issue that had been dodged/badly handled/ignored for 85 years was finally decided, definitively. Slavery was abolished /8
It answered and resolved the question: would America continue half slave and half free? It would not. The side that won was the side /7
or the desire for land or dominance. It was fought over an intensely moral issue: slavery. It is still our most killing war, 600,000 dead /6
As if they are tearing us down, our history down, banishing it. The Civil War was fought not for the usual reasons of war --mere conquest /5
Sorry, forgot to do /3.  You must argue it out.  Beyond that, the spirit of the Tear Downers seems to me in part nihilistic: /4
Forgot to put /2 on that. My thinking: you can't erase history, can't remove it, can't hide it in the corner. You must face it, discuss it -
But no reason they would have. I am against the movement to tear down statues of those who fought in the Civil War and others - Founders etc

My father was in Italy in WWII. He always said the Salvation Army folks he saw gave free donuts. The Red Cross, he said, charged 5 cents. /2
