@jmccartie should be fine then, I mean you don't even need to start the truck, its battery alone will be plenty.
@jmccartie got a straight away with enough of an incline you can just as easily bump start an ATV... is the truck a diesel? If so just be aware it's 24v and the ATV is going to be 12v
@new and just things it should include like times of day the device is not allowed to be used (ie 8p-8a), I feel like I'm missing something obvious
@new First off just pure lack of control and lack of multi-users switching on devices specifically tablets, but just at the most basic level, why does the "sub"-accounts have to go into others purchases and "download" the movie to their device to even see it in theirs?

@waltercolindres ...the caveat is they have the vehicle style you're looking for, Subaru makes some things, like wagons, that Honda/Toyota no longer make.
@waltercolindres On the Japanese brands, Honda/Toyota over Nissan/Subaru any day of the week... or just get a 4Runner, unless you need the 3rd row the Pilot has. We have a 2006 Pilot with 150K, still runs great, haven't had any problems and we've owned it since 50K miles.

@jmmiller03 the deeper you get into the home automation side the more you'll realize to do things really smart you have to have a lot of flexibility, something HomeKit will probably never provide. SmartThings has some great stuff here, and G added integration a few months ago, works great.
@jmmiller03 it's just about having more mics to hear and answer, in theory you should be able to ask your assistant to turn on/of lights, etc from anywhere in the house, right? I have decent coverage with the minis but there are still areas not covered.
@jmmiller03 it's also about getting the market share so the other vendors want to integrate when choosing which to support. Dots and Minis were only $25 for weeks around Christmas, and they kept going out of stock, I ended up with 4.
@jmmiller03 most are building the two primary players in now. Apple hasn't opened up Siri in that way... their loss. It's the next UI beyond phones.
@jmmiller03 Across *their* device types... Fixed that for ya. Good example, the best consumer thermostats are the Ecobees, they have Alexa and Google Assistant.... that's an ecosystem.
@jmmiller03 a lot of it, and the acceleration of its deep learning comes down to sheer numbers, Google has ~70% of US smartphone market and 85% globally and growing

@ScottMagdalein @brithume also it doesn't just end abruptly, it starts going up immediately, so there won't really be a notion of having to "keep" anything
@ScottMagdalein @brithume also, why shouldn't it also apply to corporations?
@ScottMagdalein @brithume first fundamentally, I'm always going to favor government as close to the people as possible, so preferring local... your response favors federal govt being more important, second it's easy to point at California/NY because they are outliers, but this impacts more than just them
@ScottMagdalein @brithume this also doesn't apply to corporations, which is good, but people should get the same benefit. The sunsetting of the personal cuts but not corporate, also lame.

@soffes you should do it just to see what happens, and then for the hell of it tip the guy an extra $20 after plugging it in
@bdmontz @ValaAfshar that said, I'm not saying blockchain is not valuable, I'm specifically talking about the cost of mining Bitcoin now, and then once it halves again... just seems stupid long term, there will be something else
@bdmontz @ValaAfshar the article was about the computational expense, I'm not trying to delve into the perceived final value of it, Bitcoin itself does feel like a bubble as most of the price seems to be coming from making money off of it rather than any intrinsic value
@davedelong as a pro user, I need more than 16 GB of RAM and that's not even a possibility, went back to iMac. That's my point. Also expanding the hard drive in year 2, etc. That's not Pro.
@bdmontz @ValaAfshar but mining Bitcoin is a zero-sum game, expanding the internet is not, so the free market claim is hardly an argument to be made.
@waltercolindres Yeah, most "apps" don't necessarily need the concept of scroll to top on each route change, but you could easily enough do it in your base router on route state ending (assuming you want to do it on every route no matter what)

@stevelackmeyer okay so to save 1,200 $40K/yr jobs you‚Äôll need almost 50MM, my point still stands.
@stevelackmeyer the problem is his salary isn‚Äôt high, especially for the size of the company he runs
@stevelackmeyer https://t.co/gn1LWjjfrf ‚Äî his cash pay is $2.1MM, stock/options is rest. If you run a 200K person company, seems fair.
@stevelackmeyer he doesn‚Äôt make that much, I used that number to show how ridiculous it is to think giving raises based on that logic is
@stevelackmeyer United Technologies has almost 200K employees, even if he was paid enough that you could take 50MM of his salary that'd be $250/employee/yr
