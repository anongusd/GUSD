@Barrand1997 @pasherri @TonyAtamanuik @AOC exactly, j. we have a generation of people that believe that and have to take drastic measures. i should have slept in my car 10 years ago instead of paying rent and actually thinking that i would get ahead of student loan payments that way. i even skipped marriage/kids. get it?

@ananavarro what i don't get is how the non-wealthy that vote r hate gov and think it is all corrupt. warren explicitly leads the charge against corruption, yet r's just don't like her. it's clear that you and r voters have no real values other than self preservation.

@Master_Squirrel @Bantauj1 @RepDanKildee @NRA @GOP wow. trump is the biggest bitch alive. talk about handouts. never applied for a job. gave at least 4 jobs to his kids in the admin. what if obama did that? anyone who thinks he is tough or smart can gtfo. look at his appearance! that is a fat whiny baby.
@Master_Squirrel @Bantauj1 @RepDanKildee @NRA @GOP it was real money, snowflake.
@Master_Squirrel @Bantauj1 @RepDanKildee @NRA @GOP it does. you are used to having your vote count more. that's white entitlement. you don't even notice. 		i am saying population matters most. and one vote should be one vote. 		"conservative-ism" is a sham pretending to be an actual set of beliefs.
@Master_Squirrel @Bantauj1 @RepDanKildee @NRA @GOP that whole idea died in the 80s. it's dumb you're just trumpists now.

@Master_Squirrel @Bantauj1 @RepDanKildee @NRA @GOP as it is now, rural americans get more than one vote for (basically) being white. you're telling me you deserve more than one vote?		population matters. laws are for humans not land area. 		it is special. laws take root here first and take 20 years to get to the rest.
@Master_Squirrel @Bantauj1 @RepDanKildee @NRA @GOP the less gov thing is bs. 		gov works when we vote in smart people with good intentions. 		whoever told you less gov is a grifter that hates themselves.
@Master_Squirrel @Bantauj1 @RepDanKildee @NRA @GOP yeah, exactly. progressive dems are already changing that. 		dude, prog dems want to tax people who make 10 mil, 70% of everything after 10 mil a year. 		you don't get taxed more if you make normal people money.
@Master_Squirrel @Bantauj1 @RepDanKildee @NRA @GOP not true. cal loses money by being in this country. and under the ec 67 cal votes in national elections equals 1 wyoming vote.  (widest gap)		that's why we will destroy the ec to have more of a say or we're going to walk. we don't need some value-less gop oligarchy nation.
@Master_Squirrel @Bantauj1 @RepDanKildee @NRA @GOP if you really want, for instance, money out of politics you should follow progressive dems. they are already addressing this stuff by rejecting pacs. so, the argument that dems are just as corrupt is dumb.
@Master_Squirrel @Bantauj1 @RepDanKildee @NRA @GOP this country needs cal and ny. cal and ny do not need this country. 		cal: #5 economy in the world. proof that progressive policy is more productive.
@Master_Squirrel @Bantauj1 @RepDanKildee @NRA @GOP it was better. right now all we are doing is rewarding an entire family that has never worked a day in their life. daddy's money. 		trump has made us friends with bully nations only, russia turning our backs on our allies. that's nuts.
@Master_Squirrel @Bantauj1 @RepDanKildee @NRA @GOP bc they are inside traders making money for the already wealthy at every turn. they lie to us normal people to get the votes. they tell you that you need to be scared of those illegals and dems. that's brainwashed.
@Master_Squirrel @Bantauj1 @RepDanKildee @NRA @GOP see that's the thing. you guys aren't tough and gritty. you aren't no-nonsense.  		obama and hrc are what's tough, worldly, deliberate, patient, kind, and have actual ability and real vision.
@Master_Squirrel @Bantauj1 @RepDanKildee @NRA @GOP also, i slept in my suv for more than 2 years to pay off 23k in student loans and keep 8k or so in my pocket,  all on 17 bucks an hour. do you know any r that would do that to get ahead?
@Master_Squirrel @Bantauj1 @RepDanKildee @NRA i'm from louisville, ky. moved to cal at age 30 bc i don't like gross republican culture. 		clinton was investigated 11 times. she never cried like kavanaugh did after 20 mins. 		the @gop are cons and you are the mark.

@Master_Squirrel @Bantauj1 @RepDanKildee what's unacceptable is white terrorism and @nra money in politics. 		two white male shootings this week, louisiana and fl. domestic terrorism by angry white males kills more than any asylum seeking immigrant, even registers on the cdc's list of public health threats.
@Master_Squirrel @Bantauj1 @RepDanKildee nope. the pres has repeated over 8k verifiable lies. this is one of them. why do you believe him? will you serve his sentence with him too?
@Master_Squirrel @Bantauj1 @RepDanKildee that's why i say it is racist. there is no other sound reason to support it or support this pres or any of his garbage ideas. let me guess, you think hrc and obama are criminals and give the benefit of the doubt to trump. he has not earned that or any leeway.
@Master_Squirrel @Bantauj1 @RepDanKildee smuggling comes in ports of entry, drugs too. 		plus, are you going to take away private land from all those ranchers and farmers? that's authoritarian communism. 		border culture and economy would be decimated. even border r's know that.
@Master_Squirrel @Bantauj1 @RepDanKildee right, next you're going to tell me there's an emergency, when in fact r's controlled all of gov for the last two years and could have passed this if they wanted to. it only became an "emergency" with a dem house. it is a manufactured, fake crisis built by a lie from a liar.

@kathypodgers no claiming. so, what? congress should look like the people it reps. 		kyrsten sinema rejected the bible at swearing in, in favor of the constitution. 		and two native american women were elected for the first time, one gay.
@kathypodgers if you are concerned about terrorism and crime your prob is with the @nra fanatics that commit mass shootings every few months like clock work. undocumented commit crimes at much lower rates than citizens.
@kathypodgers nope. 		the undocumented are undocumented bc it is a years long process to do legally. until then, they're in limbo and that's ok. 		by all means, if their are criminals, treat them as such. but being undocumented is just a way of saying this person is in line for processing.
@kathypodgers it's progress not an over through. we refuse to live in the past, unless it's to celebrate the new green deal as it compares to the original new deal. 		everything he's doing is a con.
@kathypodgers oh, yeah just announced nancy's universal background check bill coming on tues. 		the undocumented will be held to the law too. laws are for everyone.
@kathypodgers speaking for myself, but notifying you that all dems in congress will be supporting it. that's why we (voters) chose them.
@kathypodgers agreed. 		rep steve cohen introduced a bill *yesterday* that would 1. eliminate the ec and 2. not let a pres pardon himself, his family, anyone in his admin or campaign. we support it bc it's the right thing to do.
@kathypodgers fair enough. : )		i personally believe that this is the part of the framework that has outlived it's usefulness and is only keeping us from a brighter pathway. (tyranny by a minority that often votes against solidarity, the law, and doing the right thing, as in 2016.)
@kathypodgers you can be heard. but your rural white vote is not *more* important. 		as it is now, 1 wy vote equals 67 cal in national election years due to ec. 		you are used to your privilege (counted more than once). we demand you are counted equally.
@stadiumtalkcom always will be: rudy (1993) 		he never gave up and it gets me every time.
@SenatorRomney dude, you're an obnoxious creep-a-zoid.  		a junior congress-woman, not a president. it's cool, and we can handle it. 		 #ImpeachTheMF
@kathypodgers democracy is greater than the idea of being some flag-waving, white preserving, fake patriotic republic. 		you messed up by supporting trump, own it.
@kathypodgers if you want a republic move to an oligarchy country where a handful of families control all interests. 		the electoral college makes your vote count more than once compared to population centers. you do not deserve more than one vote.
we want you to pass the bill to re-open the gov bc we know that border security funding is good but the wall is in-effective and morally disgusting. the money would be better spent on all kinds of border things, just not a wall. do your job. 		@senatemajldr

@ImaVoter2020 will vote for any at all: personal pick harris/beto.   		before that happens i want our first female president to come into  office under  extraordinary circumstances: impeachment of both the pres  and vp: resulting in a pelosi 2019.

@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib yes. but you've gone too far this time. that's what i'm saying.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib you have to investigate to see if there is evidence. more than a week too.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib no, rejected. not a criminal. i am going to berate you though. bc your narrow minded vote has the very real potential to destroy this country and that constitution you claim to love pretty quickly.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib exactly. soc sec is the decision being made for you. bc it has been proven to work. we want to expand that idea to healthcare immediately and public college tuition soon.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib did you say that about b. clinton? only had a little sex affair with a consenting adult. 		obama nearly flawless. (and no there aren't going to be a bunch of stuff coming aout about him, like you're going to argue. 		meanwhile, you sold this country down the river for a scumbag.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib did your side just discover irony?
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib maybe. let's investigate.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib arrogance. the classic liberalism thing is just someone massaging your ego telling you that you are above the crowd and see things more clearly when in reality you would have went along with the nazi's until it was too late. you voted for a conman.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib but social programs and a forced savings account is. they make us save for retirement. before it's existence people retired into poverty. they're telling you to save bc the alternative wouldn't be in our best interest.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib not brash, obnoxious and class less. 		it would be a double standard if that was trumps only offense. 		it is one of a thousand. there is no need to protect this guy and i don't see why you want to.

@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib you're the fairy-tell person here. 		all the right wing minded people are desperately trying to rebrand themselves as free thinkers who know the real truth from history and seek out their own sources. it's self-serving drivel and bogus.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib yeah. and my generation has always assumed it won't be there for us. whatever. not a big deal. 		but it is a non-optional thing. it is socialist. you pay it and it is given to old widows so they can have something to live on. that's solidarity. that's socialist. i am for it.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib ok. imagine obama or hillary doing what trump does.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib so what? she's not running for anything, much less the supreme court.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib sounds like a personal prob. if you were running for a major position it should be all out. 		um. dr. ford's testimony has not been dis-proved. 		the other, lesser accuser's has, i grant you.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib see. one set of rules for you. one for everyone else. 		he should do it bc he is under very serious suspicion. innocent people welcome the opportunity to clear the air.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib socialism does not have to be total gov control. jesus. we already have socialist policies like soc sec. you watch too much propaganda and in the meantime you let the most serious threat to the countries future get away with way too much.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib omg. i know i said it first. but it is obvious that you were relying on it first. how are you not getting this?
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib then why didn't trump testify when he had the majority?
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib he was an entitled creep with zero class.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib all he had to do was say "since i am innocent and being considered for a job promotion to the highest court in the land, i ask for a complete investigation that takes as long as needed". 		instead, he cried like he's never been challenged before. he is not more important than her
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib nope. this is 2nd grade text book stuff. all i'm talking about is creating a new industry of gov backed projects.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib i knew you were going to say that. that's why i included it. 		we do not have equal rep in pres election years due to the electoral college. ex: one wyoming vote = 67 cal votes. 		what we have is tyranny by minority. white, rural minority.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib you brought race into by giving the white male automatic preference when he has done nothing to deserve it. 		there we go:you are a legitimate conspiracy cheerleader. stop watching fox news, it's not real. they are intentionally mashing opinion content in to undermine solidarity.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib i'm not. nor do we want to take away those advantages in any way. 	what we want to do is extend the same opportunities to the many. 	when you vote gop you are backing policy that hinders the many in favor of the already well-off. that's not democracy or gov by the people.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib delusional.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib she testified for 11 hours and never cried like kavanaugh did in 20 mins. that's called character. 		trump has several members of his family on the payroll. would you be ok with obama doing that? or are you protecting white privilege till the end (of which will be coming)?
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib again: not true. the socialism you are referring to was a authoritarian one. socialist policies for the people have a just place in a democratic society. and yes we should be aiming for solidarity and democracy, above being some cheese ball, flag waving, fake patriot republic.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib yes. so what? there is that soros conspiracy. he funded the caravan right? (eyes rolling)		sounds like everyone who isn't a white male is under un-due suspicion for you.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib nope. living on less than 30k a year is what's pretty good.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib aha. you're a conspiracy theorist. let me guess, you still believe in pizzagate?
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib hrc would have represented democracy and a good faith attempt to do the right thing on the world stage and engage citzens domestically. 		trump plays to the most basic impulses of social division and use against them while self dealing in the back ground.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib you're right: his actions, the things he says, his inability, his entitlement to the position all do make him evil. your actions are who you are. why do you skate over this?		he ran on the lie that he given 1m. evidence suggests it's much  more like 400m.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib Did she work for daddy or go into his biz? even if she did: she's not a lying monster. trump on records for over 6k outright lies thus far and it's indisputable. how low do we have to make the bar for your guy (and the enabling gop) to be able to participate?
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib our best policies are soicialist. see: new deal and that push for a green new deal. ...then you should be against the gop tax scam and gop spending that always explodes the deficit only to be checked later by sound dem principles.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib yes, and while that needs to be addressed you chose your side and endorsed lobbyist nra, military spending beyond any rationalization, nepotism and good ole boy cronyism. i like when people go out into the world, earn a degree, and try to be something they may not be otherwise.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib ...(2) it's almost like you say one thing "work hard, create your opportunity" and do another "he's a winner and so savvy, never mind his inherited (faux) success and lack of decency or class". 		isn't there a word for that? oh, right no integrity.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib so in your estimation, an elite is someone who worked all their life for what they wanted to be, (with minimal hiccups) that was not given their position in life via family money and business dealings. here's what i don't get: you seem to be against people earning things.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib your ideals are from a pre 2016 era when you may have been able to argue how trickle down works and fiscal conservatives are republicans. both are outdated notions. if you are anti socialism, have the elderly hand back their soc sec checks and never go to pub library again.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib do you even notice when those voted into office are from priviledged, entitled backgrounds? next, you’re going to tell me they got where they are without help and through their conviction and work alone.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib already read that one. ok, i wasn’t terribly serious about that one anyways. let’s pretend jesus was anti-accountability in gov and anti-solidarity among citizens, like you say.
@realDailyWire @benshapiro @andrewklavan @ElishaKrauss @michaeljknowles @JeremyDBoreing happy to say, i’ve never seen/heard either of your shows. seems obnoxious. but hey those “making content” bucks, huh?
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib what could be more dis-honest than what we are living right now? be honest, you voted trump. own it. own the fact that you voted for a a tv personality that lived on his father's handouts and began a political career by repeating the racist lie that obama was born abroad.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib ...scared to have to compete with the many?
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib you're not part of the gop, but you are a part of "politicians are bad" and "businessman are good" crowd. you're not a unique snow flake, gov is for the many and it's duty is to level the playing field for the less advantaged. what's the matter scared of the competition?
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib cherry picked and you're desperately trying to imply that this would put us on the road to authoritarian socialism. it will not. you could have easily chosen an article from a Scandinavian country where it works. btw, jesus was a pc socialist.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib so, you are in fact for rule of law? good, me too. seems like you wouldn't engage in undermining unless it benefited you, though. oversight: let's do it.

@katieporteroc good fun! i never knew how this worked. : ) i wonder where my rep @RepPeteAguilar ‘s office is?
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib just to show you i’m being fair, i basically agree with you on the so-called muslim ban. it is postering for the trump base but is not a ban. but, more importantly we should all (you too) be outraged at the saudi fiasco. if you’re going along with that one, god help you.
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib ...bureaucrats and dems are not your enemy. why do tou feel the need to attack capable people with honest jobs? and why defend generational handouts and  entitlement thru gop fake patriotism?
@JkaabH5 @RashidaTlaib if you don’t cringe at terms like ‘homeland security’ and ‘faithful patriot’ you bs detector may be broken. 		universal healthcare is the next logical step in social programs that have been provem to work: soc sec, and already existing aca.
@PFlowerstone @MikeLevinCA @LibsInAmerica @realDonaldTrump ...for the most part, of course. : )
@PFlowerstone @MikeLevinCA @LibsInAmerica @realDonaldTrump exactly! gop loves the myth of the self made business man and political outsider. trump is the epitome of both, and it’s caustic. 		i vote for professionals with good intentions. what gop voters call politicians and elites, i call people with honest jobs.
@MikeLevinCA @realDonaldTrump exactly mark. we tell our children to be good and kind, then sometime in thier 20s we tell them to just go along at all costs. 		we need to reject attacks on soldarity and democracy which every child and non-broken down person knows is right.  : )
@Lawrence exactly. how much more do we have to dumb down the rules so the gop can cope?

@vlirosi @RashidaTlaib @shaunking how do you pay for endless corporate welfare? gov works when professionals with good intentions are voted in. no more whining.
@lenburman @BetsyDeVosED whaaat?! we subsidize those predatory places? (i haven’t followed this issue, clearly)
@realDonaldTrump if you were half the person 41 was you’d have my respect from the other side if the aisle. but, sadly you deserve a pauper’s burial and prison for life leading up to that day.
@RIVERJPHOENlX heard that. i went through this with bob’s burgers more than a year ago and the orig law and order, (first 8 seasons of 20) year befor that. 		still waiting on l&amp;o seasons 9-20.
@realDonaldTrump was the lone holdout on a g20 vote to commit to climate change policies. this is the gop: “we should do nothing about climate change though it has been confirmed to be real and domestic gun violence doesn’t deserve action.” who votes for this inept in-action?
@redstatetake then give cal (the world’s 5th largest economy) all it’s money back. the country needs cal and ny, cal and ny do not need this country. dismantle the electoral college or we walk.  : )
@redstatetake gotta jet for now. fun talk @redstatetake!
@redstatetake certainly. i agree with that. for some reason i think that real estate seems to last forever (and the advantage of being able to cash in that equity, or simply live in it mortgage free, through generations) but agreed, cash balances don't live forever.
@redstatetake @MarkMuro1 @JohnJHarwood @ThePlumLineGS @RonBrownstein agreed. i knew that. so the rich stay rich and people from privileged or at least helpful backgrounds are the only ones allowed to participate. exactly the notion that progressives reject, entitlement. gov works when professionals with good intentions are voted in.
@redstatetake @MarkMuro1 @JohnJHarwood @ThePlumLineGS @RonBrownstein i don't get this. it took me until age 34 to even make that 17. do you think people choose how much they make? you're welcome to call my employer and ask for a bump.
@redstatetake @MarkMuro1 @JohnJHarwood @ThePlumLineGS @RonBrownstein i have 2 step bros that inherited an rv dealership in rural america and have made 70k a year since age 24. no college, no loans, stable work for decades now (they're older) and never had to be homeless. this is your gop voting block. handouts.
@redstatetake @MarkMuro1 @JohnJHarwood @ThePlumLineGS @RonBrownstein i wouldn't make 17 there. people who don't get handouts or help (the majority of people) often have to go to urban centers to make that. it's the nature of opportunity. get it?
@redstatetake @MarkMuro1 @JohnJHarwood @ThePlumLineGS @RonBrownstein i lived in rural ky and louisville for a long time. i only came to cal 5 years ago. while you may be able to have a mortgage and play house, it's at the expense of having a being in that backwards culture. but yes, that may be the retirement plan. haha.
@redstatetake @MarkMuro1 @JohnJHarwood @ThePlumLineGS @RonBrownstein if you don't want to be taxed, you are a fake patriot subverting solidarity. i don't have kids, but pay taxes so a kid down the street can go to public school. i pay soc sec so an old widow down the street has something to live on and am happy to do so. that's solidarity.
@redstatetake @MarkMuro1 @JohnJHarwood @ThePlumLineGS @RonBrownstein that's the problem. you are taking away my voting rights by having your vote count more in national election years. with electoral college, in pres elections, one wyoming vote equals 60 something cal votes.
@redstatetake @MarkMuro1 @JohnJHarwood @ThePlumLineGS @RonBrownstein the whole ind liberty thing is just people messaging your ego, telling you that you are above the group to get you to go along with their agenda that benefits that wealthy alone. “you’re an individual right? then cotw against the group of normal responsible citizens” conned.
@redstatetake @MarkMuro1 @JohnJHarwood @ThePlumLineGS @RonBrownstein it’s all relative. if i made 30 an hour instead of 17, maybe i’d live in doors and be able to meet my modest financial goals. instead, i make my 17 work. guess i’m crazy huh?
@redstatetake @MarkMuro1 @JohnJHarwood @ThePlumLineGS @RonBrownstein i’m also homeless so i can be debt-free. do you know of any gop-ers that would work that hard to earn something?
@redstatetake @MarkMuro1 @JohnJHarwood @ThePlumLineGS @RonBrownstein exactly. i argue that democracy and solidarity are our highest goal. it is above any notion of being some flag waving, white preserving, nationalistic republic where raw population doesn’t own the rules.
@redstatetake @MarkMuro1 @JohnJHarwood @ThePlumLineGS @RonBrownstein i know it was. but today we have tyranny by a minority. an emotionally under-educated minority. 		we change things in the constition that no longer serve the majority, like slavery, women’s suffrage, voting rights. 		sometimes the past belongs exactly where it is.
@redstatetake @MarkMuro1 @JohnJHarwood @ThePlumLineGS @RonBrownstein and it’s incredibly outdated, irresponsible, and hinders the direction of this country. it’s out-lived it’s usefullness. but, yeah, keep arguing for your own self preservation alone.
@benshapiro comedy gold, ben. are you scared to debate me?
@redstatetake @MarkMuro1 @JohnJHarwood @ThePlumLineGS @RonBrownstein their represention and power should be proportional to population and economic activity. right now, they get extra bonus entitled rural white people representation.

@HildaSeda @Perez1oj @michaelcdeibert not communism. some of our best policies are progressively democratic such as soc sec, medicare and even public libraries. democrats want to protect these programs and create new programs in their image, since they ahve been proven to work. for instance, single payer healthcare.
@Perez1oj @michaelcdeibert after all, this is in no way your fathers gop of "fiscal conservatives"
@Perez1oj @michaelcdeibert in a pre-2016 world i would agree. now-a-days anyone knowingly voting republican at any level of our elections has to be a conspiracy theorist. the old "i always vote right-wing" needs to be thrown out in favor of decency, re-examine your priorities miami-dade.

@clruffo yes, she was on tv. no she was no believed by the gop because they see her as simply 'not as important'. 		all he had to do is say "i request a full investigation, since i am innocent and we are talking about my lifetime appointment to the sc." how hard is that?
@GovMikeHuckabee she's trusted 		the gop is busted 		and on nov 6th it's case closed for you.

@GovMikeHuckabee @kilmeade the gop went along with all of this, every step of the way to get us to  this absolute low point. republican voters are under educated, support crime to their benefit, do not reject racism outright and have no moral  backbone of any kind. be ashamed.

@realDonaldTrump if you believed in the rule of law you would:	 	make it crystal clear that it applies to everyone equally. 	not have so many indicted or plea-dealed under your recent direct employ.	release your taxes, like every pres before.	understand that protest is vital to democracy.

#GeorgeWashington 		remember democracy and that peace of mind that we were honest to god trying our best to sort out the difficult issues?   		...what a distant memory.

@Jim1959Jr @IleanaCarmina you don't get a free pass out of investigation because you went to the right school. we'll not confirm #Kavanaugh , take our time to investigate and perhaps the women will be trusted and he'll be busted. case closed.
@Jim1959Jr @IleanaCarmina That's why it's an investigation. To gather the facts. We won't get to them by not investigating. Also, you are the one's who are anti-law. Testify, show taxes, be transparent, co-operate.

the gop went along with all of this, every step of the way to get us to this absolute low point. republican voters are under educated, support crime to their benefit, do not reject racism outright and have no moral backbone of any kind. be ashamed.  #TrumpPressConference
@realDonaldTrump if i ever get an alert in either voice or text format from you, regarding anything at all, i will take a sip of espresso then throw myself through a closed window.
public libraries, public education, medicare and social security are all progressive socialist programs built on the idea of solidarity among citizens. we must build more solidarity by investing in medicare for all and free public college education. @justicedems
i've often relied on the public library for access to ideas that i  couldn't find elsewhere back in the world before web-accessible content.  while the content of texts may not be so sorely needed in 2018, i  submit that access to wifi and charging is invaluable.
do you know a retired or elderly person drawing social security income? before it's existence americans retired into poverty. i'm glad this progressive socialist program exists. i support broad taxes for broad benefits.
pro homeless tip: immaculate hygiene and exercise will set you free.
more about me: zero consumer debt and an older vehicle in good repair. i've even  thrown 200 bucks a month at my student loans for 10 years now. if i payed 800 dollars a month to live indoors that would ruin everything and I would be overextended. dedicated to discipline.
i'm not sure if a job alone has ever made anyone middle class. perhaps that's the root of our cultural obsession with home mortgage ownership. people think they have the chance to pay one price and sell for more on top of their 9-5. always seemed dishonest to me.
from understanding much flows. solidarity, democracy, and dignity for the most vulnerable among us.
@realDonaldTrump You have zero values, zero character, zero ability and you're a goblin who has lived on handouts and just to show you I'm being fair: I always liked your haircut. It's bold.
@realDonaldTrump I will happily give you my extra 940 dollars a year in take home pay in  exchange for universal health coverage even though I personally don't  need it. Why? It's called solidarity and democracy. I want to pay broad taxes so others  basic needs are met.
@realDonaldTrump Cool, Cool. Also, Lock Him Up! (you're the him)
@realDonaldTrump you said that so strongly that I feel like you'll be out of office by the new year.
@realDonaldTrump the boy/girl couple in their 20s directly behind our lying speaker are removed from the shot starting after the 51 min mark. hint: because they never clapped or smiled.
