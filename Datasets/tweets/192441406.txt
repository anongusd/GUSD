Congressman Buck took $5500 from the gun lobby so far this year. How many more will it take to buy his vote? https://t.co/uXcwVtdV3F
@ScottRTipton got $1000 from NRA; wonder why he hasn't issued a statement yet. Has a good Democratic opponent though #votehimout
But thanks to the $9950 he received from the gun lobby in 2014, his heart doesn't ache as much https://t.co/ymbUOZSDMk
$2000 from the NRA buys her silence https://t.co/4lqk0IqrOa
If you want more from him, it will cost much more than $2500, the amount Rep. Calvert got from the NRA this cycle https://t.co/SFgCjfr1nK
$3000 from NRA to @SteveKnight25 buys his silence on gun violence
$3500 from gun lobby buys @GOPLeader silence on gun laws
@DevinNunes took $2500 this cycle from NRA. Alas, he doesn't have a serious opponent who you can use to tell him how you feel
That's it, nothing more. *goes back to counting $2000 donation from NRA* https://t.co/5Q7d2WAoUO
@RepJeffDenham took $1000 from NRA this cycle. Luckily there is a competent Democratic opponent running against him @eggman4congress
$1000 from the NRA apparently buys @RepPaulCook's silence on gun violence beyond "thoughts and prayers" https://t.co/S5glNxA7lW
@RepLaMalfa has taken $2000 from gun lobby this cycle. Maybe he's waiting to issue a meaningful statement on #Orlando?
With $2000 in gun lobby donations, I suspect @RepWesterman is feeling a little guilty today. Hence no statement
@RepFrenchHill received $2000 from NRA so far this cycle; must be waiting to issue a statement so he can get their approval first
@RepRickCrawford hasn't tweeted about #Orlando yet. Probably determining what to say without risking his $1000 donation from NRA
Alas, if you want more than prayers, you'll have to pony up: the good Senator took $5950 from the gun lobby in 2014 https://t.co/ZiqMSq405P
@JohnBoozman got $1000 from NRA this cycle. Wonder if it is enough to prevent him from supporting sensible gun laws
You took $1000 from NRA this cycle. Maybe if more fetuses had been shot you'd care to support sensible gun reform https://t.co/hVfi11qg8s
@RepDavid only has taken $1000 from NRA this cycle. Maybe he can actually stand up to NRA for once #thoughtsandprayersarenotenough
@RepMattSalmon maybe since you aren't running for re-election you can actually oppose NRA for once #thoughtsandprayersarenotenough
@RepGosar only received $1000 from NRA this cycle. Maybe he can stand up to NRA for once and support sensible gun laws
Of course, when you've received $6500 from the gun lobby this cycle, #ThoughtsAndPrayers is all you can offer https://t.co/8cxjAha7LM
Turn that sorrow into action Senator. Stand up 2 those who gave u $8950 in donations in 2012 and do the right thing https://t.co/NQEg2jeLWc
@repdonyoung took $1000 in gun lobby money this cycle. Will he stand up to NRA despite this?
@lisamurkowski received $4,000 from NRA this cycle. So much for being a "moderate" #voteherout
@RepMoBrooks follows me. Hoping that he has courage to stand up to NRA despite $1,000 donation from them this cycle
Unsurprisingly, the Congressman has taken $6000 from the gun lobby this cycle. #votehimout https://t.co/L9lF7AtueX
@RepMikeRogersAL took $1000 from NRA this cycle. Will it be enough to sway him from taking meaningful action to prevent future Orlandos?
The Representative took $2000 from the gun lobby this cycle. Not surprised all she has to offer is "prayers" https://t.co/qHcv15s7bM
@dragonflyeye Pink Pistols? https://t.co/wydr3YIwGx
@SenatorSessions took $1000 from NRA in his last reelection bid. He may be vice-president; will he show some courage and oppose them 4 once?
The good Senator has taken $4950 in NRA PAC money this cycle. Will he stand up them despite their donations? https://t.co/IWD6rDlVhv
Time for a calling out. Let's go alphabetically by state, and focus only on donations for now.

@donaltc @mattdawidowicz @Clarknt67 He's an unknown among the community. Would have to waste too much resources getting them to turn out
