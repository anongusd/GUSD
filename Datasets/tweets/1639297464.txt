that‚Äôs what blockchains are for
silicon valley no longer needs innovation
overnight

one of them is crippled and limping on its talon knuckles 		looking forlorn
on one of these foraging steet pigeons
may we puke now
how splendiferous
and that‚Äôs how some people meet their own demise 		with the stupid ass nose ring still intact
with a god damn nose ring
a forty year old punk ass hoosier boy from the midwest
for him, a punk ass hoosier boy, he thinks he‚Äôs fucking cool
his banning the poor jewish conservative woman protesting in front of his own corporate headquarters was a terrible misstep on his part. misguided. those sorts of arbitrary decisions based on perfunctory ‚Äòcommunity standards‚Äô which are outrageously left-leaning ideology. run amok
every lesbian wannabe is
like zack
like unique, zacey‚Äôs barren
she does it in cape town too		aubergine gormandizing 		obviously an avocation 		to somehow compensate in her own mind the haplessness of her own singlehood
compared to, say, what zacey chen ordinarily takes inside her own mouth		when on holiday 		in taipei
not bent
but more erect
it reminds us somewhat of the leaning tower of pisa
from street level, we‚Äôre staring up at the hobart building
winter coastal fog has already rolled in		accompanied by sprizzles 		micro thin droplets of chilled rain		which creates plenty condensation
not in a sanctuary city
doesn‚Äôt take much
zacey herself is conflicted about her own sexual orientation
how does a milquetoast like him ever sleep soundly every night 		he must be trembling in his own calvin klein boxer shorts		while he texts zacey
being the unchallenged CEO of a high tech company affords you  inalienable rights		you can stick it in anyone‚Äôs ass		without any major repercussions
slubberdegullions panhandle at montgomery street exits in the frigid cold in fits of desperation 		zack tosses them mere breadcrumbs 		as if they were all citified pigeons		waiting to starve to death 		for some one as nefarious as zach, every one of them is invisible
chief operating officer
or his COO will be
he‚Äôll be martyred
a transgender-fluid hombre like zack can be really fucking rotten to the core 		that factoid in and of itself has to be brought out to the general public in an expeditious manner
the world will never miss a zack 		not one who cherishes ‚Äòcommunity standards‚Äô		also known as ‚Äògeorge soros‚Äô socialism‚Äô, gone awry 		for the digital age
when the throngs arrive in about an hour or so via subway		zach will attempt to blend in with other pedestrians 		all for naught
zack dorsalfin
he knows he‚Äôs a loser		he confesses he‚Äôs a chump
a jerky geekboy like zack may not know he‚Äôs a target		he may not be able to foresee events while they‚Äôre unfolding.....in real time		in this case, machine-driven algorithms are utterly useless
basically, zack is a hoosier punk from the midwest 		unsophisticated 		uncouth		not articulate in the least 		when starkly compared to his own predecessors
how many of his own female interns did he pork in his SOMA loft when they had tenure at fritter is excruciatingly difficult to ascertain but one thing is for certain 		zack dorsalfin is bi-curious  		and a 3.3 billion dollar compensation package helps a lot
laced in his espresso
at union square, there‚Äôs a gargantuan   christmas tree a thousand miles high, set up almost exclusively for the ultra-affluent 		like zack		so that he may humble-boast on the roof top of the cheesecake factory 		a raving lunatic 		buzzed off nitrous oxide 		and grand mariner
he probably thinks we have a paintball pistol 		but that is an erroneous assumption on his part
you never take things personal
certainly not ours
he‚Äôs on everyone‚Äôs shit list
it‚Äôs just an educated guess
i think zack carries a glock
a rogue operative could make a tragic mistake about zack		identifying accurately 		a number of wiry thin hipster dudes with ugly ass beards trample about during rush hour		do their livelihoods depend upon it
they say.....the early bird catches the worm 		or, rather, that‚Äôs what they used to say		way before we were born
not today
nor is she in london
she‚Äôs not in new york
as per usual, zack and zacey are shuffling about frenetically doing counterintelligence trying to pinpoint our exact location through geofencing, but it‚Äôs not going to work 		we‚Äôre calibrian
you can not miss zack because he is as thin as a rail		as if he were a full fledged member of the gay barbershop quartet		they sing		acapella 		but he‚Äôs not likely to be present on market street until about eight 		after he stops in at peet‚Äôs coffee		for an organic scone
we‚Äôre thinking as long as you consume a normal amount of kombucha on a regular basis you‚Äôre less likely to die from a severe case of MRSA 		on the streets of san francisco 		that is, if you never paypal for an ugly limewire scooter 		while in transit
and from what we understand, fritter headquarters has a decent ventilation system in their building 		so, no worries
it‚Äôs like the worst form of strep throat		immune to antibiotics 		apparently it‚Äôs a flesh eating bacteria 		gone airborne
apparently a number of people have perished from MRSA
for the department of justice
we‚Äôre on a reconnaissance mission
plenty of homeless congregate outside of uncle tom‚Äôs waffle house on bush street, in close proximity to chinatown 		syringe needles stuck in their exposed arms		human feces smeared all over the local business establishments
we‚Äôre in downtown san francisco right now. searching for where zach parks his car...		but we think he commutes by muni		or one of those transgender limewire scooters

a business man should never never fritter his life away. by sly-admiring the george soros‚Äô of the universe 		it‚Äôs the incipience of his own crestfallenness
not the rest of the conservative population
from afar
but despite that unsavory fact, the torontonian continues to admire him
a fucking traitor. a punk ass jerk
these days however jack traverses primarily to thailand to meet and greet buddhist monks who don the unruffled saffron laced robes. they instill in him the abstruse principles of asceticism. where he can relinquish capitalism for the more worthy ideal of ultra-maoist globalism
a euphemism for atheistic beatitude
before jack converted to san francisco gay
jack knows. jack used to date unique
and how to foment meaningful forms of highly animated congress. while suspended 		in mid flight
it‚Äôs profoundly ugly because unique incorporates gobs of uncalled for braggadocio. an italian word. she‚Äôs never had italian dick. unique doesn‚Äôt know. truth is, unique, the unimpeachable torontonian, she‚Äôs unfamiliar about diddly-squat. about arial tents pitched in the backwoods
every other 6 hours, unique humble-whispers to other canadian men on the internet. and they‚Äôre supposed to be ‚Äòresponsive‚Äô. it‚Äôs their job. to commiserate. what the fuck for. some one else is breaking her shit down in the bedroom. stretching it out. making it emote. which is ugly
just like her personality
if she had tits it would be an entirely different story altogether. but unique confesses. she has none
often she gets hangry. moody. intractable. unique. when no one is doting on her silly fucking oriental ass. whenever she becomes disinterested in drawing out intricate tao lin laced mandalas. when her deformed shu pei puppy finally ignores the uncalled for alacrity she heaps
unique offers them, the almond milk boys, unwarranted cleavage pics. almost every other day. or night. and armpit evaluations as well. as if all these losers can‚Äôt thrive not unless she opines about the politics she concurs she‚Äôs ill-conversant about. no consolation for any one
when a sassy chinese-canadian midget savant frequently indulges in sour mash whiskey consumption, she inadvertently morphs into inveterate alcoholism, where she then spills her guts to indolent corralled men on the fly, showing them all her privacy related issues. without qualm
the one which puckers up taut when vigorously stricken with a sturdy fresh green bamboo rod. causing unique to micturate profusely. on command
someone like unique understands no shame whatsoever. she confers with those asshole men because she honestly believes she needs more masculine advice. constantly. how‚Äôs she to function in the real world if not another man is somehow not osculating her skinny little emaciated arse
a chinese-canadian midget savant batch is incompetent. she‚Äôs in her mid twenties. should know better. she should. she admits she shouldn‚Äôt offhandedly coy-flirt with other jack off men while she‚Äôs seriously involved in a monogamous relationship with an african man who‚Äôs well-hung
where unique senses she can purchase ann taylor business apparel at more than 75 percent discount, for her appallingly dismal amanuensis job, in downtown toronto, a cesspool of corrosive liberalism, where entities such as ashley madison, a swinger‚Äôs utopia of lust, reigns supreme
there is even a minor contingent of effeminate soyboys. in that surly slavish stable of hers, which point unique in the right direction, in terms of gps coordinates, when she needs to cross the southern border wall, in pursuit of those designer labeled retail outlets,
as each corralled man parcels out disparate amounts of sound advice. some provide unique with automotive maintenance recommendations. other scumbag jerk offs teach unique how to black hat hack into major news outlets, such as digital journal, a libtard tabloid, for neofeministas
what‚Äôs lacking
as tradition dictates in north eastern canada, she‚Äôs in search for ‚Äòthe new dick‚Äô. the one that can opine. is better equipped. when ever chad is sound asleep. dreaming about other asian batches who are more physically attractive than she. often unique questions her own portfolio
when one thinks of a unique as unassuming and gauche, of the assumption her current live-in futon-occupier, chad, the zimbabwean, is there solely omnipresent in her own miserable existence, as a soothsayer of sorts, why should other potential suitors be patriarchally-shamed
defined as such what inherent evil consists of is when an unscrupulous chinese-canadian vicenarian midget savant sneak-chats about on social media platforms in conjunction with a m√∂tley crew of asswipe corralled men, all of whom which in turn act as inept sycophants, on call 24/7
