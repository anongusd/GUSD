Per Civiqs, women oppose Kavanaugh confirmation 40-54, Per Quinnipiac poll, women oppose him 37-55. But he has support of 49 percent of men in both surveys. He is opposed by nearly 90 percent of Dems, backed by more than 80 percent of Republicans. https://t.co/UubK5oKQ3j https://t.co/wTISNufOhD

I agree with this. Jay has been saying it for along time. One way to diversify the people on the beat is to diversify what kind of work can be done on the beat. And I think both should be done. https://t.co/zwFTu0vznt
For what it's worth, this will sound like bragging, but I say this to address one obvious question: two of these outlets fairly recently asked me about working on their political staffs. I suppose they recognized that I am qualified, but lots of other people are too (12.) https://t.co/xhdTUjDU2v
It is simply hard for me to believe that a fair and equitable process for hiring political reporters results in 0 non-whites being qualified for those positions and therefore being hired at some of these outlets (11.) https://t.co/xhdTUjDU2v
I'm less concerned about diversity purely for the sake of coverage. White reporters should (and I think are to some extent) covering racial issues in America and Trump. My concern is more about equity and opportunity (10.) https://t.co/xhdTUjDU2v
But my guess is that group would do more on how Trump's immigration policy affects people and less on whether Jared and Ivanka are gaining or losing power in the White House. And that is a choice (9.) https://t.co/xhdTUjDU2v
I could cover hire a team of say, Yamiche Alcindor, Astead Herndon, Laura Jarrett, Sarah Kliff, Seung Min Kim, Dara Lind, and Jack Jenkins (that was basically off the top of my head) to cover the White House and I bet that group would break news and do great features (8.) https://t.co/xhdTUjDU2v
There are plenty of qualified, talented minority reporters who are interested in politics. Ultimately, editors have to decide if they want to hire these people--even if those hires might require slightly changing how those outlets approach White House coverage (7.) https://t.co/xhdTUjDU2v
Another issue: many outlets are desperate to avoid being cast as biased against GOP. A White House team that had 3 black/Latino reporters out of 7 would more accurately reflect America than 0/7, but might not be ideal if the aim is to get palace gossip from this White House (6.) https://t.co/xhdTUjDU2v
Second issue is that many editors in DC view the WH reporter role as more about describing internal tensions (so Jared v. Bannon) than say, how Trump affects America's racial dynamics. Reporters (like myself) not particularly interested in "palace intrigue" are disadvantaged (5.) https://t.co/xhdTUjDU2v
The reporters in DC who are most followed on Twitter by other reporters in DC is a heavily-male, heavily-white group. Of the top 25, three non-white reporters. Only four are women. https://t.co/Shga8ZHIzI (4) https://t.co/xhdTUjDU2v
The first issue is journalism hiring, like hiring in other industries, is often about who we know, who is in our personal circle, who our circle thinks is good. And look at this analysis by Vox. (3.) https://t.co/2lxXnIFsrG https://t.co/xhdTUjDU2v
It is not that these outlets completely disregard racial diversity or are unaware of their shortcomings on these issues. They all have recruiting directors/editors in charge of staffing/diversity committees, etc. (2.) https://t.co/xhdTUjDU2v

The fact that Donnelly backed Gorsuch, a year before the election, but not Kavanaugh now is worth remarking upon. Trump is likely to come to Indiana next month and attack him for this vote, so there is some political risk. But a yes vote would have irritated Donnelly's base. https://t.co/y1jxK1EvDs

Also, much of the news broken by people like Ronan Farrow, Jane Mayer, Greg Miller and Eric Lipton would not be known unless they unearthed it. If the deputy attorney general is actually leaving, everyone in the world will be able to match that reporting in about 20 seconds.
Many news outlets have the view that anyone can write a story, but not everyone can "break" a story. Breaking news has value, and outlets should hire IN PART for that. But the significant number of people trying to be the next Maggie Haberman is often not helpful to readers.
The "fake news" crowd is often attacking deeply-reported, accurate accountability journalism. But the endless reporting trying to be first to say Kelly or Priebus would be fired serves outlets and journalists ("we were first") but only confuses readers. They tell me this.
There has been some great access-based journalism the last two years. But there has also been way, way too much, overhyped, thinly-sourced stuff that confuses readers and over time erodes trust in the media overall.
I stopped reading Axios early last year for exactly this reason: thinly-sourced, overhyped stories that often didn't pan out. Every outlet makes mistakes. But what happened today did not match what their initial story implied.
Axios sometimes breaks news. So the rest of the media felt compelled to follow them. Which whoever leaked this Rosenstein story was betting on. And it worked. https://t.co/8IATvkZtJ2

When Democrats do stuff like pleading to Kavanaugh himself to ask for a delay of the hearings, what is the point? This is a contest of power, not kindness. There is zero chance he is going to do that.
Sounds like Trump wanted to talk to Woodward just like he really wants to talk to Mueller.

Flake is suggesting he will press Kavanaugh on Trump's statements about Sessions over the weekend. Important. Much different if a Republican is raising that issue.
Most important comments of the day are right now--how much Flake is praising Kavanaugh. If he is voting yes (and that seems very likely right now) hard to see how this nomination goes down. Not a surprise at all, but still important.
The Sasse statement was a long attack on the idea that people should talk about the policy views of justices who have a huge impact on U.S. policy. And it described people who care about what the court does as unhinged and hysterical. His level of sanctimony is something. https://t.co/rw2jKi72tk

Lots of great data in this report.  About 88 percent of Trump 2016 voters are white,  60 percent of Clinton supporters.

Abrams is a fairly traditional Democrat on policy, to the right of the Sanders‚Äô crowd. She is a black woman, but that does not make her extra liberal. Kemp ran a Trumpy-campaign, but was not that Trumpy before. Should be a compelling race and one I hope gets smart coverage (2)
Abrams says there should not be a giant monument celebrating people who fought to keep her ancestors enslaved. Kemp says he has a pickup truck which he can use to ‚Äúround up‚Äù and ‚Äútake home‚Äù illegal immigrants. Both candidates are really partisan, the NYT concludes today. (1)
This might explain why the ‚Äúestablishment‚Äù candidates keep winning Democratic primaries. The party is moving left on policy, but it may not be ready for the kind of ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù that Sanders wants. https://t.co/KFFmSrPpZZ

I see a divide on last night between the reporters whose jobs demand access to WH officials and senior Republicans and those who do not need such access.  I am not sure who is right.  I think that divide is natural.  But I think it is worrisome such a divide exists.
I think we in the press should be humble about how we view the act from last night. I was at the Colbert WHCA in 2006. It was uncomfortable.  He was not polite. But a lot of his criticisms of Bush and the press were later borne out by reality.
In other words, Trump has been attacking the press for three years.  It is part of his message. Much of his base agrees with him.  The press does not damage its standing much with its choice of dinner comedians, nor can the press improve its standing by say, ending the dinner.
There has been a decades-long campaign to attack the press as biased against the GOP. Trump has taken it to a new level, since previous presidents have not attacked the press as aggressively as he has. But the WHCA dinner has almost no bearing on this much more important dynamic.

This seems exactly right to me. Jones needed high black turnout and support but also more support among whites than Dems typically get in Alabama. https://t.co/2wZiyYc3dA
An important part of the Jones campaign: he took fairly traditional Democratic stances on nearly issue, made no promises to back Trump's agenda. He is likely to be the 49th Democrat on nearly every issue. https://t.co/17TOH5M1kZ

"The people of Alabama have spoken," says Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill, a Republican, seeming to reject Moore's contention that the result is somehow in doubt.
Moore sounds like he is nowhere near conceding. And all but said it is God's will for him to contest the results.
"Evangelical" is becoming a fraught term to some who say that their religious beliefs are evangelical, but that evangelical has come to be understood as being aligned with politicians like Moore. https://t.co/XuSLWa1rQh

I am reading a lot of good policy coverage of Graham-Cassidy.  This for example. https://t.co/MnlZSgHH2Y
I think the features that drive GOP donors/activists/members (reduced spending, fewer rules, abortion limits) are very well known. https://t.co/YbT8XgL4zo
I think they understand the bill:less money from feds, fewer rules for insurers. I don't think they want to advertise those features though. https://t.co/o19qFDVx9Z
Under this bill, feds will spend less money on health insurance. States will have more flexibility.  But more people covered? Very unlikely. https://t.co/vkkXUmpa3f

If they are deferring all questions to Mueller, the congressional investigation becomes much less useful.
It's very hard to have congressional oversight if the administration won't answer basic questions.
These no one "pressured" me responses are designed to get media favorable coverage for Trump. I hope no one falls for them.
Sounds like we should read the papers more, watch Senate hearings less. The intel chiefs won't deny what is in the papers.
I feel like Coates is advertising he will tell the senators whatever they want in private, Rogers seems to be really defending Trump.

Trump is right about this: country was divided, long before he or Obama entered office.
I think Trump has now been clear that people in his campaign did not deal with Russians. So press can look into that.
I get the sense that talking to the president may not be the best guide to learning what the Trump administration will do.
He can't really talk about policy in much detail. So I don't know how pressers can be anything more than bashing press.
As @jayrosen_nyu says, the press has now turned into a "hate object" for Trump. We will have to figure out how to handle that.
.@Acosta of CNN standing strong, asking tough questions, highlighting Trump's falsehoods. This is not easy, and he's doing a great job.
Has a president ever been more obsessed with cable news?
This man went around the country saying the elected president was not born in the United States. But other people have hatred!
If you didn't read E.J. Dionne's column today, go back and do so.
Listen carefully. He will not rule out that his campaign team talked to the Russians. Trump only said that he did not talk to the Russians.
The man who bashed Muslims and Mexicans in his campaign is mad about "hateful" coverage by CNN.
Good for my colleague @PeterAlexander, who used his question to say to the president's face that he is constantly lying. That took guts.
PBS, NBC, CBS get questions. So looks like Team Trump has folded on the "'we won't call on traditional media" approach.
Wow. WSJ staff is mad at the paper's editor for being too pro-Trump. And the reward is Trump is trashing the paper and likening it to NYT.
So Flynn lied to Pence, said he didn't remember the details of the call with Russian ambassador and that is the reason for the firing.
Well, he did call on a reporter from NPR. So progress on that front.
Russian intervention in American election is "fake news," leaking is the real problem.
So Trump says he asked for Flynn to resign. Clearing that up.
Context for Trump's claims he won a historic victory. He did not. https://t.co/mhS80lAdIJ
If you are leader of the Free World, please, yes, just repeat "a number I've heard," without asking for verification.
I don't purchase drugs often, but I doubt they are cheaper than candy bars. But I did get to laugh.
I think it's useful for him to highlight what he views as accomplishments, like end of TPP. And this is what presidents do at pressers.
People can fact-check his claims (like the wrong electoral college comment) but it's not clear he cares about being accurate.
If the Iran deal is terrible, he can withdraw from it. If the media lied about Flynn, Trump could have kept him.
No. He did not inherit a mess, at least at home. Unemployment was 4.8 percent when Trump started. It was 7.8 percent in 2009.
A full-on war on the press here. Full on. Press is "out of control," he says. Press is not supposed to be under his control.

This is not a conservative-liberal thing. This is transcript of Bush's last news conference. AP. CNN. ABC. NYT. https://t.co/5RsS1c73Yp
What we learned is that Trump feels the media and national security establishment forced out Flynn, not Trump. He is frustrated with both.
I'm all for having different outlets ask questions. But we learned almost nothing about how the national security adviser departed.
Trump has called on Reuters, Fox News, Daily Caller, D.C. ABC News affiliate, New York Post, Fox Biz, Christian Broadcasting, Townhall.
There was a quasi-Flynn question from Christian Broadcasting Network and now Townhall. This is a big break from Obama or Bush.
Wow. Team Trump is not playing around. Very intentional effort to have conservative-leaning outlets ask questions at news conferences.

Joy is right. I wonder if those leakers Spicer was complaining about will inform us that Trump knew about Flynn conversation. https://t.co/j1gCCLaCHO
This briefing suggests that Team Trump seems to think that Flynn downplaying sanctions while Obama was president is not a big problem.
Good Skype questions!
These Skype questions are actually an opportunity to hear concerns outside of the Beltway. But they are not being used well.
I think leaks are a serious issue. That said, these leaks are not about where terrorists are.
Spicer was clear that the problem was not discussing U.S sanctions with Russia, but lying about it to Mike Pence and others. Interesting.
"The president has been incredibly tough on Russia." There are many ways to suggest Trump is not in Russia's pocket. Why go over-the-top?
So Trump asked for the resignation, Spicer says. So a firing. That was a bit unclear last night.

@DavidLauter Right. Well, I think he is really trying to appeal to black vote. And her to young. But not working for either so far.
@esglaude This is a good point. I am wary of "race relations" as opposed to more precise issues, like the ones in your book.
@IanMessmore @AriRabinHavt That might be true. I"m still not excited about it being asked.
@2Buddy I think Bernie's supporters are going to stick with him!
@ChineduAchebe Well, Clinton is doing better among whites than Sanders among blacks. So what you said.
@JasonWCole I'm not totally sure why, but Clinton is winning more than 80% of black vote.
@rolandsmartin So LBJ, Clinton, Obama, Reagan enacted policies that affected black people in specific ways, not race relations generally.
@rolandsmartin I was suggesting presidents change government policy on race more than racial relations/feelings.
So did Sanders do anything tonight to close his deficit with blacks? Did Clinton build her support among young white liberals? I doubt it.
Am I the only one who thinks even running for president should not require you to name what precisely you pray for?

Rubio is scripted, but he is of course right. Conservatives are frustrated because Obama has accomplished his liberal goals.

Obama got little passed in his Senate career but a lot done as president, whether you agree with his agenda or not.

On Iran negotiations, Clinton blasted Obama in 08. But he followed her model as president. She was right back then.

She keep saying look at her policy. Sanders is talking about values. He is suggesting that giving speeches at Goldman is inherently bad.
I"m pretty sure people on Wall Street would prefer Clinton to Sanders as president.
Clinton speaks in terms of policy and keeps saying her policy is better. Sanders is speaking about values and principles, not policy.
