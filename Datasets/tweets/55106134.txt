@btoellner @jspencebaker @kclightrail @BrianHartleyKC @KCBizJournal The real ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù cycle was the border war and move of corporate interests to suburban offices (that require massive new infrastructure). See huge 435 investments that never end as an example.
@btoellner @jspencebaker @kclightrail @BrianHartleyKC @KCBizJournal Not sure it‚Äôs a ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù cycle. DT fell into imbalance by massive loss of jobs (mostly to suburban greenfield). Market (yes, with incentives) DT filled empty older offices with apartments/hotels. Office still laggard. Suburban building rates not helping. On DT we add no new infra.
@jspencebaker @btoellner @kclightrail @BrianHartleyKC @KCBizJournal Totally understand argument. But difference between residential &amp; office is significant. DT is far from ‚Äúhot.‚Äù  We have taken 2.5 m sq/ft offline in recent years for apartment and hotel conversions. So we have limited office space, but prices lag due to quality. It‚Äôs tough mix
@jspencebaker @btoellner @kclightrail @BrianHartleyKC @KCBizJournal The age and general condition of the building, and the significant planned improvements to bring it to quality Class A was a consideration. The building will stay on the tax rolls at slightly above current rate. Exemptions would be applied to realized improvements.

@kevinklink @kckansascity @warofthesuburbs @TomGerend @KCMO @KCMOManager I‚Äôll get Haussmann to work on bulldozing our downtown. ;)	But seriously, I agree that filling in gaps is more important than height. Hopefully we can land on a mix between central Paris and a bit of La D√®fense.
@kckansascity @warofthesuburbs @TomGerend @KCMO @KCMOManager Yes. Ultimately it‚Äôs density and vibrancy that makes developments work. We don‚Äôt need soaring high-rises. But a skyline changing tower would be nice to see someday.
Football/basketball coaching duos go cage match against other SEC and Big 12 coaches. Got to agree with @GabeDeArmond, Barry and Cuonzo match up pretty favorably. #Mizzou https://t.co/fnHiIyZNJM
Really find land value taxes intriguing. Helps prevent long-term land hold. Would discourage parking lots as ‚Äúfuture development parcels.‚Äù https://t.co/BPLqYhVVbZ
This is true. We can push developers and development, but until we see more top down demand pressure that drives lease rates, we will struggle gaining more significant high rises. https://t.co/n2EE5XcQV5
@warofthesuburbs @TomGerend @kckansascity @KCMO @KCMOManager Well, there used to be 200,000+ jobs downtown and fewer than 5,000 places to live. Why our highways are designed to get people in and out of DT as fast as possible. So we‚Äôve grown one metric. Still have office work to do.
@kckansascity @jspencebaker @TomGerend @Beertheist @KCCrossroads @kcstreetcar @KCMO @kclightrail @Crossland_Inc Must add that the convention center hotel proposal was the primary driver in both projects coming in the market. @Loews_Hotels grows market and creates new spin-off nights to nearby hotels at different price points.

@st_vockrodt So true. Flexible zoning could help. Also should consider some other land tax structures. WYCO in particular has been hammered by tax appeals on even operating big-boxes.
Big-box retail tax breaks have always been a terrible gamble. When they invariably close, communities are left with an albatross facility and huge surface lot. Other retail has more adaptive reuse opportunities, hold value. Communities should have more minimum land tax options. https://t.co/0uwaJLb6e6

@ebelden @EricWBunch @KatyWrites @mellinger It‚Äôs certainly different for everyone. However, most people do significantly underestimate the cost of car ownership once you add in gas, insurance, parking, tax, recurring maintenance, unexpected maintenance...
@EricWBunch @ebelden @KatyWrites @mellinger True. So few seem to comprehend how much vehicle ownership costs when you add up operation, insurance, fuel... not to mention if you finance. It‚Äôs crazy expensive.
@EricWBunch @ebelden @KatyWrites @mellinger Agree. Entire metro should be looking at eliminating single-family only zoning. Allow ancillary rental units on lots... et cetera.
@EricWBunch @ebelden @KatyWrites @mellinger Yes. Plus less restrictive zoning that allows more density will help keep access and costs down.
@ebelden @KatyWrites @mellinger It‚Äôs a VERY complex issue. One that is certainly not easy to solve. Especially when you are trying to preserve affordability in specific ‚Äúhot‚Äù neighborhoods. I appreciate @QuintonLucasKC‚Äôs hard work on the issue and am active in efforts to assist. Happy to discuss over a beer!

@Beertheist @designerjenn Yes! 	Logic over anger and clicks. 	Happy to help convene meaningful discussions on how project finance and public participation really works. 	There are real issues, but the sky isn‚Äôt falling.
@ChrisPerrey @Arsenal @BurnsMcDonnell @SportingKC @Chiefs @Royals @Black_Veatch Thanks Chris! ;)
@huskersundevil @chevrolet @GM @volvocars @BMW I agree 100%. Just not sure @GM will be the ones to get it right.
@worleygirl Was on the wait list. Still not convinced of their reliability.
The @chevrolet Volt was the first American car I‚Äôve bought as an adult. Not sure I will see @GM evolve with better EVs anytime soon. Same with Ford. They seem stuck on trucks and SUVs  	Back to @volvocars and @BMW for me. https://t.co/MZ4QvjmEfs

@KJH05 @mellinger The one thing fried turkeys and meth labs have in common. üòÇ
@mellinger @AKGarcia331 True. I‚Äôve tried to be an adult for several years now. Always order McGonigal‚Äôs fresh and cook with a self made glaze and stuffing. Best year was when I made a bourbon maple glaze for the bird. A+ effort that year. The ‚Äúextra‚Äù bourbon didn‚Äôt hurt with the family joy.
@JasonKingBR @mellinger Why do you hate antioxidants that come from Northeastern swamps? Sorry, I mean bogs. üòÇ

@jmartkc SCOTUS is an entirely different issue. As for elected officials. There are good ones that are older, but a youth infusion across the board would help.
@samuraihawk @btoellner @KCPLDistrict @KCMO Sigh. I advocated early on for a higher-res screen. That said, no one predicted that thousands would gather for televised events as regularly as it has happened.
@btoellner @KCPLDistrict Yes. But the investment has been worth it. I would argue that @kcmo would have invested much more than the gap to revive the moribund downtown.

Good reporting by @st_vockrodt 3 initial observations:	1. Sorry to see @joliejustus drop bid	2. The ‚Äúchattering class‚Äù already in overdrive. Sadly, this race could turn negative. Not what anyone needs. 	3. Steak dinners in Iowa are much better than New Hampshire. 	@KCStar https://t.co/Jp58dV2T2E
The race for @KCMO mayor is full of great candidates. 	Now I hope all of those candidates focus on the issues that matter, and how they would build consensus. KC has a weak mayor form of gov‚Äôt. It requires a deft hand to make change. https://t.co/Jp58dV2T2E

@downtownkc @KCIEdgemoor @KCStar Yes. However, the City Council delayed the process for quite a while. Then the revised gate count was just settled a few weeks ago. I think all is well... but the developer needs to be more visible in the public eye.
@KrisNielsenKC Zero to one.
These items and delays are all reasonable and legitimate. That said, @KCIEdgemoor has to go above and beyond in public engagement, information and transparency. As a HUGE supporter of the new terminal, I expect more, as should all metro residents. @KCStar https://t.co/UGsx0RanzY
