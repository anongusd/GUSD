@gr8tjude That makes a lot of sense.. he did not make the team but gets to play anyways.  Why not just share your salary with him?  Sounds like the cheerleader decision.. everyone makes the team.  Come on.. think about what you are asking for.

@KennedyNation You are both from CA... what else in common??
@SenFeinstein More interference.. good job.
@AnnCoulter Wow.. I use to enjoy your comments. Now you harp on Trump whenever you can.  Give him some slack.. We will get our wall, world peace, and a great country again.  It will take time.  Patience is a virtue.
@marklevinshow Best show yet.. makes me feel despair for our beautiful country.  So sad that it has been high jacked by progressives leaving Trump and his administration a huge mess to make safe again.  I hope he was listening!!
@TeamTedCruz @BigLeague2020 Glad that he had tough  questions  today but where are the other senators?? When a company is based in CA., it makes perfect sense that most employees are liberal.  It will not change.

@conservmillen Stabbings.
@Liz_Wheeler Just back from trip to London..local papers headlines were about 10 stabbings in less than 10 days.
@OliverMcGee You can see the defiance in his eyes.  Hateful, disrespect for American people.
@GomerP6699 It goes deeper and deeper.  What were they thinking..
@NewtTrump Possible distraction from DACA discussion and credit given to Trump?? Change the topic.
@baltimoresun @BaltCitySchools Just ask who is running the city .. liberal Democrats.
@SenSanders Bernie thinks if he says this enough times we will all believe him..  wrong.  Is he overwhelmed with positive News .. still can not give Trump any credit.
@thehill Isn't it the corporations that are passing down their gains to employees.  Salary increases and bonuses.  That is good for everyone.
@RealSaavedra @RitaPanahi Oh Alisyn... So disappointed in you.  Would you rather the  US taxpayers not do Well? Just report the real news and do not try to spin it. You will have less stress and sleep better at night!!!
@greta Build the wall.	Health care reform.. open up free market and ability to purchase affordable HC insurance.
@MSNBC Well .. his TRUMP name is his brand how do you separate that... ??

@CGasparino Time to get over it Charlie.. 90% negative media coverage.
@charliekirk11 You are soooo right.   So many factors lead to success or failures.

@HARRISFAULKNER @Mediaite Congratulations.. love your shows.. respect your opinion,  poise, grace, and beauty!
@tedcruz UNIONS.
@PinkBelgium @TruthFeedNews She should lose her law license... and that is just the start she is so Corrupt.
Did you watch Eboni arguing with Sheriff David Williams on Fox this am?? Her anti Trump feelings get her into trouble. Who argues with the guest?? Pitbull had to be shut down by Griff Jenkins.
@3lectric5heep She better plan to stay home.. sponsors beware.
@thehill How childish.. they think they are making a difference.
@BecketAdams HRC.. correction.
@BecketAdams Save that joy.. it will fizzle.  Reminds me of election night when Dem. Realized HTC lost.
@KurlyNY15 @tedcruz What an awesome tax relief for parents who want the best education for their children.  Public schools need competion.. charter schools or whatever it takes to educate  all children.
@KurlyNY15 @tedcruz That does not work.. unions suck up the money and protect problem teachers.  Tried that for years.
@IncognitoPatrio I wondered why the panic over "acting" director... Drain the swamp.. shut it down.
@RepMiaLove Agreed.. should be part of orientation for all new employees.  HOWEVER, any person,  man or women elected to government office should already understand the difference between right or wrong and respect for others.
@FoxBusiness @SenSchumer Your need to grandstand is obvious.. I do not care about what you want.
@FoxNews How about all men and women should be held accountable?  Equal justice for all.
@dbongino Be careful..
@greta 10  cents a quart picking raspberries at age 10.  I Hated raspberries for years but Remember with pride my Dad telling someone that I was his best picker.

@Mookiejookie @WalshFreedom Everybody has a right to their own opinion even if you do not like it. Who will judge?
@FoxNewsInsider @WillieGeist @MooreSenate He is a better choice than an abortion supporter.
@FoxNewsInsider @realDonaldTrump He does not get it... parenting skills 101.
@JudicialWatch Drain the swamp..
@YoungDems4Trump You should have thought of conquense.. where were your  values?
@BlissTabitha Excellent article but misleading title .. shows press bias once again.
Rep Curbelo (R-FL) needs to form a Republican Hispanic Caucus. Hopefully, more will join him.   Let the Democrats have there own closed group.  Who needs them?

@LuisPin23257352 Was ... worst president.
@pkcapitol @RandPaul Give Senator Paul a break.  If I had 6 broken ribs, I would be on pain killers and not able to move around. I had bruised ribs but not broken . ..  It was very painful.
@theblaze That film will lose money.  What a bad idea...
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump Mitch needs to resign.. come on Rep. Party Stand Up to your "leader". Clean up the swamp.
@FoxBusiness Go Away.. We dont need or care about your opinion .
@JudgeJeanine Let's hope they say no.. He did not fulfill his job responsibility.   He should be sitting in jail for deserting.
@GOPLeader @POTUS @HouseGOP Does not matter if they do not become law.  Focus on quality not quanity.. please.
@KamVTV Yes... was surprised.  Wish our MSM would report this.. doubt it.
@greta Cover up?  Eyewitnesses must fear for their lives.  Continue to press for better information.  Thank you.
@JudicialWatch Where is the city manager or council members??  People have lost their alligence to America.  So Sick.

@ACLJ This is hard to believe.. is it fake news??
@NWOinPanicMode @AnbMiele Let us have hope.
@AmyMek @thebradfordfile Never give up... for our children, grandchildren.

@SarahPalinUSA I saw a picture with a receding hairline.

@CGasparino @realDonaldTrump You sound disappointed. . Wish you would support our president and help him MAGA.
@politico Shows their liberal roots.. like most journalists.
@LouDobbs @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump DOJ settles and taxpayer pays the bill.  Is that all?

@davidwebbshow @DailyCaller Selective memory??
@ericbolling So sorry for your loss. It is heartbreaking.
@JamesOKeefeIII They Must be brain washed.. if they can not report the truth, they need to get out of journalism.
@ACLJ And Lois Learner loses her pension .. right?
@FreedomWorks @Jim_Jordan I hope so... if the dems support it we know it is not a good conservative bill.
@JackPosobiec So how did Mc Cain get it...  Many complicit.
@GeraldoRivera Many options to keep produce costs reasonable... like tax cuts for the producers. Lets get our youth to work.  Hard work builds character.
@FoxNews @NewYorker I wonder if their subscriptions increase with covers like this... doubt it.
@AnnCoulter Higher education promotes independent thinking.. Lets keep everyone down.. great message professor!
@toddschnitt @Delta @FAANews What about all the people with dog allergies or asthma? Who is watching out for them?
@witsnewsdotcom @GoldnemovesGold Laughed out loud... so true!
@Lrihendry Yes... this makes a lot of sense.
@HeyTammyBruce Best to stop talking about another attempt to change the narrative.  Taxes,  Clinton , Obama,  treason, health care more important.
@FoxNews @FoxNewsOpinion Not sure why Fox keeps him on.. Juan .. do you really say what you believe??  Liberal script or talking point for the day?
@seanhannity Now what???  Corruption is all around us.
Good news. Beef exports up 25%, dairy up 16% in last 12 months. Success for farmers &amp; food proccessors.. go Trump Administration!!
@CGasparino Showing your true colors.. liberal attack when you have nothing constructive to say.  It is time for the networks to stop the fake news.
@w_terrence @davidwebbshow @realDonaldTrump Ok.. he needs a FBI visit... what was he thinking???
@deneenborelli She has got to go..
@ByronYork @IngrahamAngle She is digging a bigger hole for herself.. can't get an audience here.. has to go to UK.
@thehill Should be worried...They should have cut payments long ago.  I hope the insurance companies step in and give us some real low cost options.
@DailyCaller Afraid of a challenger.. she would lose!
@FoxNews Another pay check.. with no strings attached!
@IngrahamAngle Black .. white.. We are all Americans.. grow up .. respect our flag.  Do something constructive if you have a problem with society.

@GovMikeHuckabee @TBN @realDonaldTrump @PressSec We saw you in NYC at your Fox show.  Love the new format and large theater. Congratulations.
@davebriggstv Makes sense not to give the players any recognition.. they will stop if they can't get their message out.. whatever it is.
@gabriellahope_ So.  CNN is at it again.. spreading fake news.
@SaraCarterDC But will anything be done ???
@WayneDupreeShow That is so wrong... why is society so corrupt??  Think people !
@DLoesch Well .. they probably had public grant money and had to spend it or lose it.
@TomiLahren He is one of the good guys.
@DLoesch How dumb.. what a waste to time and resources.  I would have told them my golf handicap if they asked!!
@greta This will be interesting to follow. So far...All talk and no action.  Bet they can not function together.

@YoMellyMel @ericbolling @ConnieRomero5 I think it will be Tucker then Jessie.  Wake up Fox.
@ericbolling Please don't give up .. you have to fight the liberal haters.
@thehill Always blame the other guy... never accept responsibility.   Must be GOP rule #1.
@dagenmcdowell Picking up  insulin  prescription today.. it will cost over $900 for 3 month supply. Stuck. Pay or do not take rx??
