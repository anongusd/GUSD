Blast to the world that US Senators and Dem #POTUS candidates @SenWarren, @SenBernie, @SenGillibrand, @KamalaHarris, @SenAmyKlobuchar, @SenCoryGardner voted against protecting babies #bornalive from botched #abortion, supporting #Infanticide. They have blood on their hands #shame

What‚Äôs is your crack pipe? When you tell me that legal #abortion saves babies lives &amp; lowers the infant mortality rate you must be tweaking.  What part of Every Abortion Kills A Human do you not get? You can‚Äôt lower the mortality rate by killing. #ThursdayThoughts #FetalUprising

@ChrisWrightActs @RitaDrown Still a separate human being.
@ChrisWrightActs @RitaDrown Instruments of death don‚Äôt belong in the uterus. Killing innocent humans is wrong no matter where it takes place.
@ChrisWrightActs @RitaDrown Come on you know that a new born cannot live with out the assistance of others. Should people be allowed to let a newborn just lay there and die? We are compelled by law to use our bodies to take care of those who cannot take care of themselves.
@mclovinbk @EricaDVM Really? Becuase you you look up when the heartbeat begins it‚Äôs at 18-22 days.
@ChrisWrightActs @RitaDrown With their own dna, their own heart pumping their own blood though their own blood steam, their own organs functioning and growing and developing. They are a separate human being and have a right to grow and develop just like every other human.
@EricaDVM @mclovinbk Silly doctor, you should know basic terms even if you are a vet. Zygote, embryo, fetus, infant, toddler, teen .... are all terms for the stage of development of a child. A human child is a human child no matter what stage they are.
@ChrisWrightActs @RitaDrown I believe that anyone can do what they want with their own body until they use that power to harm another body. As I fully believe the human in the womb is a unique, separate human I cannot condone killing that human.
@ChrisWrightActs @RitaDrown No one is condoning abortion? I‚Äôm at a loss for words here as thay is 100 percent exactly what you are doing. With any issue in the world you would call yourself pro-that issue so why not with abortion? Because you know there is something wrong with it.
While some take a #SundayMorning stroll, I get to laugh at Sunday Morning #trolls who think they are progressive by arguing for the right to slaughter innocent humans at the alter of their convenience. #Abortion is the true war on #women. Human rights for all! #FetalUprising
@ChrisWrightActs This is not a woman‚Äôs issue, this is a human issue. Abortion effects everyone involved from the mother to the father and the innocent human being killed. I stand up because it wrong.
@LostDiva Seriously you need a vagina to know it‚Äôs wrong to kill people. Ignorance must truly be bliss.
@mclovinbk For you to say I don‚Äôt care once a child is born is just ignorance. The child in the womb is alive and fully deserves his or her life@to be protected from murder.
I may wish Obama a happy birthday on #ObamaDay but I would remind him that he supported the slaughter of so many innocent humans who never got to see a #birthday. The #FetalUprising is upon us and we will see an end legalized child sacrifice by #abortion. #prolife #RiseUp
@LostDiva Me being pregnant is irrelevant to the scientific fact that a human fetus is just that, a human. Zygote, embryo, fetus, infant, toddler, teen, adult.. all stages of life of a human.
@LostDiva Hahahahahahahahahaja

When someone tells me to shut up because I‚Äôm old, white and male it just shows they are ageist, racist and sexist. But I guess @diavolonox just can‚Äôt form an actual argument so she had to attempt to insult me instead. I have an opinion against killing humans and I won‚Äôt shut up!

@LeahNTorres again you fail to understand what the "this" is. When "this" is ripping a human limb from limb it's called murder.

@AgQueue I did make a blanket statement about whether or not anyone should have the right to kill babies, i stand by it. #abortion is evil
@Drs4Autonomy if course I want abortion to be illegal it is an act of homicide that destroys children
@Drs4Autonomy you don't provide abortions, you kill children and I pray you repent and turn to Christ. #abortion is killing, doctors heal
@iniquitouspixel Mathew 19:18
@Drs4Autonomy nice try but I never said anything close to that. Just know that #abortion will be abolished and women will try be free then
@iniquitouspixel strangulation, gun shot, poisoning, dismemberment, abortion are all form of murder  - thou shalt not commit murder
@iniquitouspixel are you deaf? He very much mentioned murder.
@iniquitouspixel it's called the Ten Commandments "thou shalt not commit murder" that covers all acts of murder including #abortion
@Drs4Autonomy not really, what dehumanizes is #abortion #prochoice is anti-women and anti-feminism. It destroys the beauty of motherhood
@iniquitouspixel I have and Jesus did mention #abortion as well as gun violence and all other forms if homicide, "thou shalt not kill"
@Drs4Autonomy but killing one of your children so the others won't be homeless is logical? I call that  psychopathic #abortion is homicide
@Drs4Autonomy responsible parents don't kill their children, #abortion is the ultimate irresponsible act a parent can do
@Drs4Autonomy what's best for your family is not killing members of your family by #abortion
@Drs4Autonomy if there's shame then maybe that's because #abortion is a shameful act. However this is forgiveness and healing in Christ

@kelseamcbelsea @marybkimball @twindiana men hitting women is violence, every time
Let's get this straight @PPact - You will NEVER educate my daughters and sons that #violence is part of the beauty of sex. #sexed is my job.

@CircleCityStyle nothing boring about loving and respecting my wife enough to NOT hit her in the name of pleasure #sexed
@CircleCityStyle telling little girls that it's ok for her boyfriend to hit her is not about education or sexual preference #sexed

@DCucina96 I want to say I do appreciate the civil discourse, I refuse to talk to people when they just get nasty.
@DCucina96 When those "rights" include the killing of another person they cease to become rights. This is 100 percent about human rights
@DCucina96 The was once said about blacks in 1857, remember Dred Scott? a fetus can not be a potential human, it cannot turn into a giraffe
@DCucina96 thats like saying your free to be anti-slavery but don't tell others not to own slaves. #abortion is the murder of a human person
@DCucina96 you keep saying that but not backing anything up. Refute that a humans starts as a zygote, embryo, fetus, infant, toddler ....
@DCucina96 So embryology is not science? Whether or not someone is a human or not is is not science? ur the 1 who keeps bringing in religion
@DCucina96 funny I never brought God into this, you did. I just showed basic human embryology. #abortion kills a human, not potential human
@DCucina96 science in not opinion. Zygote, Embryo, Fetus, Infant, Toddler, Teen, Adult are all stages of the life of a human, not opinion
@TemporalLizardo @YouthDefence ummmm do you actually follow the news, re-check your facts on Savita

@sugarcrashed @LeahNTorres this is what you call a #strawman argument, miscarriage is a natural death, abortion is intentional killing.
@sugarcrashed @LeahNTorres telling someone not to kill their offspring is not dehumanizing them, killing their offspring is. #prolife
@LeahNTorres Leah many in the south said there would be detrimental consequences to recognizing blacks as persons, dehumanization is wrong
@LeahNTorres The only detrimental consequences recognizing embryos &amp; fetuses as persons will be that you can no longer get paid to kill them
@LeahNTorres @Legally_De @thinkbanned Leah you honestly seem to just talk in circles to justify your killing of human persons in the womb
@pmason03 @Legally_De @LeahNTorres paved the way like Susan B Anthony who recognized abortion is wrong and anti-woman.
@LeahNTorres Then again you would also have to classify heart attacks as suicide by your logic. If someone pushed her, that is murder
@LeahNTorres Because they are natural death, not induced death. BIG difference.
@LeahNTorres @StRYouth Embryo does = woman or man just at different stage of their life. Zygote, Embryo, Fetus, Infant, Toddler, Teen, Adult
@LeahNTorres @StRYouth if miscarriage is manslaughter is a heart attack or stroke suicide? You need to go back to med school I think
@LeahNTorres @StRYouth again, miscarriage is a natural assurance, murder and manslaughter are not. I thought you had a med degree?

@AskFrontier I've e-mailed, called I still can't get anyone who can explain whats going on. I signed up for internet on the 7th, still nada
@LeahNTorres as someone with a med degree who kills babies u should know, miscarriage is natural death, abortion is induced death @StRYouth
@AskFrontier I just don't believe that anymore, i have been lied to and left waiting to many times
@FrontierCorp maybe you may be cheaper than @timewarnercable but at least they will actually show up for an appointment and not lie to me
Are you kidding me @FrontierCorp now your person straight up lied to me, how many times do i have to wait home for someone to show up?
hey @FrontierCorp this makes three times I have sat an waited for instillation and no one showed up or called me. Do you hate new customers?
@StevenErtelt @Liberty_ORTL @JoshBrahm I was not replying to the article, but a tweet, i don't normally click on random tweet links
@StevenErtelt @Liberty_ORTL @JoshBrahm yes but I was replying 2 a tweet not a video. A tweet that tagged me saying "pro-lifers hate women"
@AbbyJohnson @dougontap that's almost like trying to teach a woman how to use a grill (it's a joke people)
@StevenErtelt @Liberty_ORTL @JoshBrahm the original tweet I was @ in left out "some" all I saw "pro-life people should stop hating women..."
@StevenErtelt @JoshBrahm I will rephrase, I think the title is bogus and not inline with video. Not seeing those comments as "hating women"
Bacon is made from pigs, pigs eat grass, therefore pork is just highly processed grass. So really bacon is vegetarian. #baconisvegetarian
@VoteGOP2014 @kburke6759 @JillStanek @LiveActionFilms Sorry but I do not know a single pro-lifer who hates any woman this is a bogus article
