It's the first day of #WomensHistoryMonth and we're not going to let Bernie Sanders take credit for the political excitement in this country led by women!
Bernie Sanders endorsed 11 house candidates in the general, 9 of whom were challengers and only 2 of whom were women (both lost). Bernie did not endorse @lucymcbath @AOC @IlhanMN @RashidaTlaib @AyannaPressley @LaurenUnderwood or @SenatorSinema /9
Of all these amazing women candidates the only one endorsed by Bernie Sanders in 2018 was @SenJackyRosen. In fact Bernie actively campaigned against @sharicedavids and @GovWhitmer in the primaries (he endorsed Whitmer later in the general). /8
In the 2018 midterms 60% of the flipped house seats were flipped by women candidates. Both flipped senate seats were by women and 4/7 flipped governorships were also flipped by women /7 https://t.co/oghynvUm68
Technically youth voter turnout in midterms was lower than in the general (31% vs 50%) but youth voter turnout for the general was expected while it was 10 points higher than expected in midterms. So what really drives youth turnout? #Midterms were after all the year of the woman
The youth vote is great but young voters are not reliable at the ballot box and Hillary did well with all the demographics that are. She also did well with voters that Sanders claims to speak for like voters making under $50,000. /5
While Hillary lost the youth vote she pretty much dominated in every other demographic. She won working class voters, voters without a college degree, women, African Americans, voters where healthcare was the most important issue, and registered Democrats https://t.co/L9pGRPQu55
Bernie won 71% of the youth vote in the 2016 Democratic primary compared to Obama winning 60% in 2008 but turnout was lower in the 2016 Democratic primary (though still high compared to others). Therefore its unlikely Bernie actually brought too many young voters into the process
In particular Bernie emphasized that he got more youth votes in the primary than Trump and Hillary combined saying "We brought a lot of young people into the process." While its true that Bernie got a high youth vote in the primaries does that really mean he brought ppl in? /2
The 2020 Democratic Presidential primary is underway with a large field including five women! Many have discussed conversations with the 2016 Democratic Primary winner @HillaryClinton but Bernie Sanders went on @TheView this morning to emphasize his political differences /1

This lack of concrete research on women's issues is why AWP is transitioning to a think tank. Too often the information we have on women's issues is from the hard work of activists and not supported by research studies to provide the statistics needed for legislation
Despite everything we know about the necessity of abortion and the harm done by #TRAP laws, #Hyde, and if abortion is made illegal again, we still don't have enough researched studies to provide concrete numbers on this harm. Just how many women will die if Roe is repealed?
Native people get their health insurance through the Indian Health Care Improvement Act provided by the government. But again due to Hyde they cannot use their insurance to pay for an abortion. https://t.co/hmL3pZJMRb
The Federal Bureau of prisons cannot fund abortions and women's private insurance is suspended when they're in prison. Therefore not only do they need to get special permission to have an abortion but they also need to fund it https://t.co/kcuxwX4qnL
States can determine for themselves if medicaid funds can be used for abortions but currently over half of states disallow medicaid users to use insurance for their abortions https://t.co/QhrTcw0bUU
The #HydeAmendment makes it impossible for people on federally provided insurance to use their insurance to pay for an abortion. This includes women on medicaid, in the army, in prison, in immigration custody, and native women living on reservations.
While abortion is thankfully still legal it is under siege and practically inaccessible in many states with TRAP laws that make it virtually impossible for an abortion clinic to stay open. States continue to try and pass heartbeat and personhood bills to make abortion illegal
Making abortion illegal doesn't actually lessen the number of abortions, it only makes them dangerous and more difficult to get which is compounded if you're poor or a WOC. Rich women will always be able to travel or pay enough to have a safe procedure
In 1873, the Comstock Laws banned the publication and dissemination of information about birth control which led to more anti abortion laws. By 1910 every state had outlawed abortion but this only drove abortions underground and made them more dangerous
This practice also led to greater infections of laboring women as doctors didn't wash their hands between patients. Dr Semmelweis noticed the midwife staffed clinic didn't have women w/ childbed fever but his warnings weren't listened to https://t.co/10FdEOMPSl
Male physicians worked to delegitimize midwives and other women performing abortions to drive women to seek out male doctors for their reproductive care. This led to the dismissive phrase "That's just an old wives tale" to make these women seem silly and anti-science
As soon as the American Medical Association was formed in 1857 its members pushed to make abortion illegal. A few years later, they were helped along by Anthony Comstock who considered himself a vice crusader and hounded Madame Restell to death
As doctors medicalized healthcare and tried to make women's reproductive matters their purview rather than midwives, they sought to criminalize abortion. Abortions were mostly performed by women such as Madame Restell and by midwives using abortifacients https://t.co/5THr43AVgI
Historically abortion was a private matter between women not regulated by law. Even the Catholic church considered life beginning at "quickening" not at conception. Abortions were common through most of the 19th century in the US w/ one estimate placing the rate at 1 in 5 women
@RBraceySherman wrote this thread about the history of the use of abortions by black women in America to combat the attempts by the anti-choice movement to claim abortions are racist https://t.co/Fg8AQEDPMN
@CynthiaGreenlee wrote this important thread including readings about the long history of black women's activism that helped lead to #RoevWade https://t.co/V2cuMf9Ifs
Today is the 46th anniversary of #RoevWade &amp; unfortunately it's in serious peril with our current political climate and #SCOTUS. Abortion was legalized in all 50 states 46 years ago but the fight started long before and continues today #Roe46 #reproductiverights. Thread

AWP is spending the next 2 years fighting to enfranchise more women and stop #VoterSuppression. Join us!
To read more on how DV affects #VoterSuppression for women read AWP cofounder @queenmab87's piece for @RanttMedia /7 https://t.co/OcRMKi3r3O
Once women have left a DV relationship they can have trouble voting because they don't want their addresses to be public or they've changed their name or they were forced to leave documents behind /6
Women in #CoerciveControl relationships could have their votes controlled and their documentation for a #VoterID withheld by their partner without any physical violence. If a woman can't access her documents to register, or get an ID, or can't drive to the polls, she can't vote.
While no one knows how you vote inside the voting booth if you're a registered democrat it is possible that literature from candidates and the party could come to your house and your husband could see. This makes it harder for women to be informed on candidates /4
As an AWP follower once said if she had still been married to her ex during the 2016 primaries she wouldn't have been able to vote at all while living in her caucus state /3
Voter intimidation by husbands against wives is a big problem with caucuses. Caucuses require everyone's vote to be public which makes a wife in a DV relationship voting against her husband's wishes impossible /2

2. "Which is why on Election Night, I declared that our fight to count every vote is not about me. It is about us. It‚Äôs about the democracy we share and our responsibility to preserve our way of life. Our democracy ‚Äì because voting is a right and not a privilege." - Stacey Abrams
1. @staceyabrams ‚Äúwe are a mighty nation because we embedded in our national experiment the chance to fix what is broken. To call out what has faltered. To demand fairness wherever it can be found."

Abortion is legal in name only in many states. Women often have to travel, spend money they don‚Äôt have, endure waiting periods. Whatever the courts deem isn‚Äôt an ‚Äúundue burden‚Äù #RiseUpForRoe #StopKavanaugh #SaveRoe #WhatsAtStake
Roe isn‚Äôt even enough. There are states with just 1 or 2 clinics. This is an economic issue and an issue of equality #RiseUpForRoe #StopKavanaugh #SaveRoe #WhatsAtStake
1 in 4 women will have an abortion. Over 60% of women who have had an abortion are mothers. We all know a woman who has had an abortion #RiseUpForRoe #StopKavanaugh #SaveRoe #WhatsAtStake
It‚Äôs scary to stand up and talk about ones personal decision to get an abortion and the right uses that silence against us. We have to get really brave to speak about our experiences #RiseUpForRoe #StopKavanaugh #SaveRoe #WhatsAtStake
We have the numbers. We need to keep fighting. They want us misinformed so we‚Äôre less dangerous #RiseUpForRoe #StopKavanaugh #WhatsAtStake #SaveRoe
Only 17 states have laws protecting abortion if Roe is overturned #RiseUpForRoe #StopKavanaugh #WhatsAtStake #SaveRoe

If you think your polling place isn't ADA compliant contact your local election board, local reps, and report the issue to @AccessAdvocates #CripTheVote #VoterEmpowermentDay /8 https://t.co/q1dHMIB0gB
In a national survey by @NDRNadvocates almost a third of people with disabilities reported having difficulty casting their ballots (that's over 10 mil people) #CripTheVote #VoterEmpowermentDay /7
Polling places are supposed to be equipped with machines for the visually impaired and with sign language interpreters for the hearing impaired. Services dogs are also supposed to be allowed into polling places #CripTheVote #VoterEmpowermentDay /6
Improperly trained poll workers might incorrectly prevent someone with disabilities from voting if they think their accommodations aren't allowed and challenge their rights to vote (despite this being illegal #CripTheVote #VoterEmpowermentDay /5
While all polling places are supposed to be ADA compliant, the GAO found that only 1 in 4 polling places are fulling accessible. Polling places often dont have enough parking or ramps, dont have accessible machines, or don't have properly trained workers  https://t.co/2HJjEB8eFE
According to "Access Denied," a study by @ACLU only CA has a fully accessible website allowing for people w/ disabilities to easily register online. Features that aren't always available are accessible forms, color contrast, size options, alt text for images, etc #CripTheVote /3
According to a study by Rutgers about 34.6 mil people are voters with disabilities. The study found that in 2008 about 3 mil people were prevented from voting due to disability issues #VoterEmpowermentDay #CripTheVote /2
Every Tuesday we're doing a thread on #VotingRights leading up to #VoterEmpowermentDay on Sept 25. #VoterEmpowermentDay is a day to celebrate our right to vote &amp; educate on #VoterSuppression to #GOTV for #Midterms2018! This week it's about voting while disabled #CripTheVote /1

There is no law that requires immigrant families to be separated despite Trump's claims. The decision to charge everyone crossing the border w/ illegal entry &amp; to charge asylum seekers in criminal court are both from this admin not a "democratic law" #FamiliesBelongTogether /16
Worse than that border patrol agents are lying to parents about how long they'll be separated and where their children are going. #KeepFamiliesTogether #FamiliesBelongTogether /15 https://t.co/oLhK9RWJv3
The policy doesnt say that families must be separated but a zero tolerance immigration policy means parents are criminally prosecuted making family separation inevitable bec you can't be with your children in federal jail (as opposed to detention centers) #KeepFamiliesTogether
A zero tolerance policy was announced that separates families at the border. One woman described her infant daughter being taken from her while she was breastfeeding. At least 500 children have been separated since last month /13 #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/zI92PR9Imc

Part of this admins anti immigrant policies is to attack #DACA-Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Created in 2012 to allow young ppl brought to this country illegally by their parents to get a temp reprieve from deportation &amp; to work, study &amp; obtain driver's licenses /8
Trump is using #ICE to target, detain, and deport parents, sick children, domestic violence victims, and younger immigrants with temporary protection through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program without due process or congressional inquiries /7
In the creation of DHS and ICE, ‚ÄúCongress established a monster‚Äù that could be used by someone like Trump to precisely these ends, says Bill Ong Hing, a professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law and director of its Immigration and Deportation Defense Clinic /6
By 2013, the United States was spending more money on immigration enforcement than all other federal criminal law enforcement agencies combined. Partnerships with local police have given ICE an unprecedented presence in communities across the country /5
A goal of DHS was ‚ÄúMoving toward a 100 [percent] rate of removal for all removable aliens is critical to allow the ICE to provide the level of immigration enforcement necessary to keep America secure,‚Äù /4
Immigration and Naturalization Services, under the Justice Department, was now part of this new, national security-focused agency with focuses on customs enforcement, citizenship and immigration, and border protection. Immigration services were now part of Homeland Security /3
#ICE was started in the wake of 9/11 out of a reactionary political reorganization that created the Dept of Homeland Security which absorbed 22 federal agencies &amp; 170,000 fed employees under the banner of national security /2 https://t.co/RVoSqMDTqI

The decision today doesn't affect the larger class action suit on the issue of undocumented minors being allowed to get abortions but does prevent this specific case from being used as precedent in the class action suit #JusticeForJane
The DC Circuit Court ruled that Jane Doe could leave the shelter to get her abortion and she got one the next day. The #SupremeCourt threw out that decision but Jane Doe already got her abortion /3
The #SupremeCourt granted the government‚Äôs request to throw out the D.C. Circuit‚Äôs ruling, but it rejected the government‚Äôs plea to sanction the teen‚Äôs lawyers  /2 @SCOTUSblog https://t.co/Oe8w8hyYWH
While we focus on the #MasterpieceCakeshop case the #SupremeCourt also ruled today on one of the #JusticeForJane cases petitioning for the govt to allow undocumented minors to get abortions while in federal custody /1 https://t.co/JxL7t2nMxF
As @KristenClarkeJD explains even without changing discrimination law the court missed an opportunity to further protect #LGBTQ people from discrimination https://t.co/l71yztuUmb
Outside the legal discussion the #MasterpieceCakeshop ruling also creates a narrative of a conservative anti LGBTQ win and paves the way for more religious freedom bills or to use "religious bias" in future anti discrimination cases /11
Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor dissented with Ginsburg writing that the baker turned away the couple before a design (or message) could even be discussed and failed to prove that wedding cakes convey a message. /10
While a 7-2 decision seems like most of the court was in agreement, Kagan and Breyer wrote a concurrent opinion that emphasized that discrimination against messages is not religious discrimination. /9
In the #MasterpieceCakeshop case the couples was denied a cake because they were gay whereas in the previous rulings by the commission services were denied because the bakers found the messages on the cakes to be offensive. Civil-rights laws protect individuals, not messages. /8
Under a proper civil-rights law, businesses cannot discriminate against a customer because of his or her race, or religion, or sexual orientation; businesses, aren‚Äôt bound by the 1st Amendment &amp; can reject messages‚Äîas long as they would reject the same message from any customer.
Another reading of the commissions decision would be upholding the bakers' decision that the cake would be offensive not that the commission was deciding what is and isn't offensive /7
Kennedy also claimed that the commission violated the 1st amendment in that they based decisions on ‚Äúthe government‚Äôs own assessment of offensiveness,‚Äù because they ruled against Christians denied services who wanted cakes depicting gay couples with a cross-out mark /6
The ruling doesnt change discrimination law but it claims "religious bias" in that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission did not afford Phillips ‚Äúneutral and respectful consideration of his claims‚Äù for religious exemption in denying services /5 @Profepps https://t.co/m1OPf5UwoO
One issue with the #MasterpieceCakeshop is that it wasn't a perfect case to rule on these issues as gay marriage wasn't legal in Colorado yet when services were denied and it was unclear if the baker would have denied all cakes to gay customers or just a wedding cake /4
@VictoriaDKirby emphasized that the #MasterpieceCakeshop case and these bills privilege an individual's moral convictions over another's civil rights and the discrimination wont stop at the #LGBTQ community /3 https://t.co/ypzpBDjqQu
Many states have passed #ReligiousFreedom bills in order to protect people discriminating against #LGBTQ people but as @VictoriaDKirby at the #WinWithWomen conference explained-these bills go further in stripping protections /2 https://t.co/Pr7iINAV6b
Today the #SupremeCourt in a 7-2 decision ruled in favor of the #MasterpieceCakeshop and against the gay couple suing them for denial of services. While many are claiming the decision was sufficiently narrow as to not harm #LGBTQ protections the truth isn't so simple. Thread/1

Motherhood is a large contribution to the gender wage gap because women with children face wage penalties as compared to women without children but fathers receive a wage premium when they have children. Race exacerbates these disparities #MomsEqualPay https://t.co/adY9AjWBNh
The pay gap for women is still 80 cents to the dollar on average but that gap widens even more when looking at mothers. Mothers on average make 71 cents to every dollar a father makes according to @nwlc /1 #MomsEqualPay https://t.co/kXO62A7REx

32% of women in jail have a mental illness (more than double the rate of men) &amp; 86% of women in jail have experienced sexual violence. Nearly 2/3 of incarcerated women are women of color. The vast majority of women (over 80%) are in jail for non violent offenses @verainstitute
Trans women face increased risks due to money bail as they are often placed in male prisons and then forced to be in solitary confinement awaiting trial #EndMoneyBail /4 https://t.co/arNJwPJq9N
A study by the @ellabakercenter found that when family members cover costs from a loved one‚Äôs arrest, 83% of those who cover the costs are women. Women are most likely to bear the financial responsibility for paying a family member‚Äôs bail even if they are not incarcerated /3
Keeping women in jail pending trial because they can't afford bail often forces their children into unstable living situations as most mothers put in jail are single parents #EndMoneyBail #FreeBlackMamas /2

It‚Äôs critical to both elect anti racist people to change policy and have grassroots people hold policy makers accountable @DrIbram
We don‚Äôt think of racism as health policy but they‚Äôre related as racist policies kill @DrIbram
Racist policies kill @DrIbram
In states where marijuana becomes legal the people currently making a living from selling marijuana won‚Äôt have the capital to start a weed business @DrIbram
More people die from drunk driving but the highest demographic for drunk driving is white men @DrIbram
It‚Äôs not enough to legalize the drug we have to free the people in jail for consuming it @DrIbram
More people are in jail for consuming marijuana than selling it.
Statistically it‚Äôs more appropriate to call places dangerous unemployed neighborhoods than dangerous black neighborhoods. But then the answer would be jobs and not prisons and the people who benefit from prisons would lose @DrIbram
Anti racists aren‚Äôt manipulated anymore because they‚Äôre getting into power. @DrIbram
The heart of all these struggles is a power struggle @DrIbram
https://t.co/aIdzKYGewi
If you believe that there‚Äôs nothing fundamentally different between rich elite white women and poor black women than all they need is opportunities and the harmful policies off their backs @DrIbram
When we use anti racist policies we‚Äôre arguing that there is nothing fundamentally right or wrong with any racial group. Only individuals @DrIbram
White men convince white women to choose policies that uphold race over gender that hurt them to hurt blacks people @DrIbram
The use of rape to lynch black men both harm black men and uphold white women‚Äôs sexuality @DrIbram
Rather than changing the policies we try to start programs to ‚Äúimprove people.‚Äù We need to change the policies @DrIbram
Black maternal mortality is much higher than white maternal mortality. Either there‚Äôs something wrong with black women or there‚Äôs discrimination @DrIbram
Economic, political, and social self interest drove racist policies. They tried to claim that black inferiority drove disparities not racism policies @DrIbram
Historically racist ideas were produced to justify existing racist policies that benefited them @DrIbram
Do we think white men were ignorant that only 25% of black men lynched were even accused of rape while using this justification or was something else going on? @DrIbram
I wanted to separate the producers of racism from the consumers. @DrIbram
We imagine racist attacks as coming from hate and ignorance and that the cradle of ideas is ignorance and hate.
The hypersexual black woman was always in contrast to the asexual white woman. The white men raping their slaves wanted to convince the world the women were pursuing them @DrIbram

Sexist ideas see women as weak and black women as not really women. So strong black women are seen as men. Weakness is seen as the height of womanhood and strength makes women bad women. @DrIbram
Uncle Toms Cabin portrayed the black race as a feminist race. Racist ideas about race/genders were always in contrast
Historically the black race has been constructed as a masculine race while the white race has been constructed as a masculine race @DrIbram
Black people are affected by different ideas targeted different parts of their identity @DrIbram
There are different ideas that have targeted each racial group. And different groups will reject ideas about themselves but accept them about others (black men accepting racist ideas about black Woman). At the heart of this is an intersectional analysis @DrIbram
One cannot truly be an antiracist without being a feminist @DrIbram

Facebook and twitter need to target the false information and propaganda about elections
The whistleblower from Cambridge analytica appeared before congress and admitted their goal was voter suppression
The citizenship question added to the 2020 census is the first time we‚Äôve had that question in 6 decades and will depress turnout and representation of the communities that need to be counted most @KristenClarkeJD
The 2020 census is key for anyone who cares about democracy. It‚Äôs very important to get a full picture of the demographic changes for representation @KristenClarkeJD
People are now just looking at Wisconsin and their restrictive voter id law that directly impacted voter turnout for POC @KristenClarkeJD
We lead a program called Election Protection (866-ourvote) a hotline to call about voter suppression issues
Follow @LawyersComm @AFJustice to look for information on nominees
If there is a nominee from your home state get a group together and vet them
Contact your senators in writing so they can make it into the legislative record
To fight judicial nominees we need to raise our voices during the nominations faze. We need to call our senators and shame them into blocking these nominations. They need to use the blue slip rule that blocks a nomination if both Home state senators block it
We need to be locally involved to protect our elections so every American citizen can vote @KristenClarkeJD
We should be championing same day registration, early voting, pre resgistration to make it easier for everyone to vote @KristenClarkeJD
90% of Trumps judicial nominees have been white, 80% have been male. This does not reflect our diverse country and will have long lasting affects on our judiciary @KristenClarkeJD
We have seen judicial nominees from trump who have called trans people Satan‚Äôs children, have support of voter suppression, wrote in favor of the KKK @KristenClarkeJD

Through the ballot box we can achieve radical criminal justice reform. Elected prosecutors are often the ones who choose to prosecute in a police brutality. Mayors choose who runs police depts. Elected sheriffs decide solitary confinement issues @KristenClarkeJD
In 2 states (Maine and Vermont) felons retain their rights even from jail. When race is taken out of the equation people get it @KristenClarkeJD
Felon disenfranchisement laws prevent 6 million people and 13% of black men from voting @KristenClarkeJD
The wins against #VoterSuppression show the importance of the courts and litigation @KristenClarkeJD
There were many challenges to this commission including questions about privacy after asking for data from every state election board and a federal law requiring transparency from commissions @KristenClarkeJD
The people hired showed the transparent intent of the commission. People like kris kobach who is a main driver of the proof of citizenship laws @KristenClarkeJD
Last year trump basically created a commission to support trumps baseless claims about voter fraud @KristenClarkeJD
RT @RanttMedia: Voter suppression is one of the greatest threats to American democracy and civil rights		@KristenClarkeJD of the Lawyers' C‚Ä¶
These battles can take years because states can challenge every win in a higher court @KristenClarkeJD
Voter purges remove people from the rolls that have managed to get registered despite obstacles @KristenClarkeJD
These laws are all about picking off people in the margins. In close elections this can be determinative @KristenClarkeJD
Some states have passed proof of citizenship laws that would require sending a photocopy of your birth certificate to vote
Unless 100% of citizens in our democracy can vote something is wrong with our democracy @KristenClarkeJD
That day Texas passed a law that required voter IDs to vote disenfranchising thousands of people
Shelby v Holder struck down section 5 in 2013 which removed federal review until congress could come up with another one. We‚Äôve been waiting 5 years @KristenClarkeJD
Most would agree the nations most important civil rights legislation is the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The heart of the VRA was section 5 that applied to 16 states that needed federal review for voting laws to ensure they wouldn‚Äôt cause #VoterSuppression @KristenClarkeJD
Under Jeff Sessions this administration has turned its back on civil rights. They gave reignited the war on drugs, ignore police brutality, roll back trans protections, faze out a fight to private prisons, and more @KristenClarkeJD
@LawyersComm was founded 55 years ago at the request of JFK. The goal of the first meeting was to engage private lawyers more in the civil rights fight.
In virtually every job I‚Äôve had men have been in charge so it‚Äôs a treat to be among women leading non profits and organizations in the resistance @KristenClarkeJD
@KristenClarkeJD from @LawyersComm is here to talk to us about voting rights! #VoterEmpowerment #VotingRightsAreHumanRights #WinWithWomen https://t.co/a5G0eYh3EN
Refugees and immigrants often have psychological feelings of being excluded and so don‚Äôt participate in civic engagement
Intersectionality doesn‚Äôt mean agreeing on everything but we do need to respect them including women who hold religious faith
We need to stand up for all immigrants and not just fight when Trump attacks Muslim immigrants
Immigrant women do a lot of caregiving work so when they‚Äôre being rounded up who will take up elder care?
Childcare should not be a barrier to education. If a woman has a child then can bring a child to class.

If someone is a progressive woman we support them because in 10 years another woman will see that. The woman who breaks the glass ceiling is the last one to show up after 100 others have thrown themselves against it @lkherman (and @shondarhimes)
I want it to be that women running for office is the most boring thing in the world. I want to work myself into being obsolete @amandalitman
@runforsomething has a 50% success rate with half the people endorsed being women and held being POC. That means that even if there isn‚Äôt another blue wave the power of incumbency will keep them in
RT @bevtgooden: On the way to @theAWParty #WinWithWomen conference to share thoughts on violence against women.
Really good advice for candidates: feelings are treasures and you bury them deep. After we‚Äôve won you dig them back up @SherryForHawaii
The criticisms from women far outweigh the criticism from men down to refusing to donate because of the font of my website @KatCalvinLA
Being a young woman you have to work harder and louder to be taken seriously @amandalitman
There are also the little things of having to think about your dress being too low cut or your make up. My job is primarily talking to men who are older than me which adds another dimension @amandalitman
When women say #TimesUp or #MeToo to our ‚Äúlate great senator‚Äù who was a serial assaulter they are immediately silenced and the fact that he‚Äôs dead seems to absolve him @SherryForHawaii
The first thing @ProjWitchHunt has had to confront is that many women won‚Äôt support a woman over a man who has been accused of sexual assault @KatCalvinLA
There‚Äôs a shocking number of women who will convince themselves that if it‚Äôs a man they like he couldn‚Äôt possibly be an abuser @KatCalvinLA
My mother always told me if they‚Äôre not listening you go someplace higher and shout louder @KatCalvinLA
We need more women running but we also need more women campaign managers and supporting women‚Äôs campaigns @SherryForHawaii
People say ‚Äúthis rumor is about to come out about you...is it time to gracefully withdraw?‚Äù I say no bitch it‚Äôs not @SherryForHawaii

I started with modest goals of getting a seat on the women‚Äôs commission in Hawaii and then Trump was elected @SherryForHawaii
I am running because I never want my daughter to look at something and think she can‚Äôt do it @LisaForWard6
People constantly ask @LisaForWard6 for her resume and assume the qualifications of her opponent without vetting
There‚Äôs a record number of women running for office but that‚Äôs increasing the share from 22% to 25%. Men don‚Äôt need to be scared we‚Äôre taking over...yet @amandalitman
More and more women are running for office as unapologetically women. They‚Äôre running showing breastfeeding, showing themselves athletic, as their whole selves @amandalitman
Women are feeling that if they‚Äôre not at the table they‚Äôre on the menu @amandalitman
So many women look at trump and think if he can be president I can run @amandalitman
The more women you have in an office the more you reduce the risk of sexual harassment @KatCalvinLA (the solution isn‚Äôt only hiring men)

By allowing discrimination against trans people you‚Äôre allowing discrimination against all protected classes
This is such an important point we need to remember. Anti LGBTQ laws remove protections for all protected classes #WinwithWomen #LGBT #LGBTQ https://t.co/eFmttAXvzm
A lot of the targets of the LGBT community are gutting the civil rights act. 90% of the time the actual text removes employment discrimination protections for all protected classes @VictoriaDKirby
Religious exemption bills hurt queer parents and children who need homes
Religious exemption bills are becoming law in too many states where people can say it‚Äôs against their religion to place children in LGBT homes @VictoriaDKirby
@TheTaskForce looks at other progressive fights and to pop in the LGBTQ lens and people. LGBTQ people need to show up for the people who showed up for marriage equality @VictoriaDKirby
Don‚Äôt just fight for your own cause. The best way to have allies is to be one @AshleeMPreston
I‚Äôm going everywhere trans people aren‚Äôt welcome @AshleeMPreston
White privilege is not a curse word or an insult. When used correctly it‚Äôs a tool @AshleeMPreston
When trans women are killed it‚Äôs not because they‚Äôre ‚Äútricking‚Äù people. They‚Äôre killed by trans amorous men who are plagued by toxic masculinity @AshleeMPreston
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to play by respectability politics set by people who don‚Äôt respect us‚Äù @AshleeMPreston
People are calling it call out culture but I disagree with that phrase because we need to show how these conversations should go. We need to call out bigotry and say what it is @AshleeMPreston
We cannot tell people how to treat us if we not extending that same courtesy to each other. We need to start with our own communities @AshleeMPreston
@UniteThePoor is working with @TheTaskForce to reach the conflicted middle to address real moral issues and change the narrative about what‚Äôs moral @VictoriaDKirby
It‚Äôs moral to lift up people and work to economic justice, reproductive justice. People of faith might agree with the principles but are taught who you sleep with is wrong @VictoriaDKirby

The protections for sexual orientation don‚Äôt protect gender identity @AshleeMPreston
Our work should always be about discrimination. We need to queer the movement. When talking about ‚Äúbanning the box‚Äù for felony convictions we also need to ban the box for gender that causes discrimination @VictoriaDKirby
Marriage equality wasn‚Äôt the issue our community chose. Republicans used gay marriage to drive voting which forced the LGBT community to fight it and educate people @VictoriaDKirby
The best way to be an ally is to ask what‚Äôs needed not to decide what‚Äôs best. The LGBT community is still often led by white men @AshleeMPreston
We‚Äôre ignoring the killing of mostly black trans women, of trump rolling back prison protections for trans people @AshleeMPreston
When we talk about only marriage equality we‚Äôre talking about cis gay white men and ignoring that marriage is second to survival. @AshleeMPreston
Religious conviction bills are larger than just religion but instead include bills like stand your ground laws allowing personal fears to justify discrimination and harm @VictoriaDKirby
When people think about the #masterpiece cake case they‚Äôre often thinking about privileged white men wanting a wedding cake not the implications of religious beliefs, ‚Äúmoral convictions‚Äù trumping someone else‚Äôs civil rights @VictoriaDKirby
#LGBTQ issues often need to be framed in ways that are palatable to cis gay white men who are seen as the face of #LGBTQ issues. Intersectionality is important to including women, black women, and trans people @AshleeMPreston

Nothing within the system will ever be revolutionary but that doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt have work to do within the system @IjeomaOluo
If you‚Äôre working within the system it should be to try and find the inefficiencies and cracks
If you‚Äôre white and you come into a black community to help without your goal being irrelevancy than you don‚Äôt have the right goal @IjeomaOluo
If you feel you can‚Äôt fully challenge the status quo then you need to look to how to empower those who can. Those who have nothing to lose and can make your job of upholding the status quo harder @IjeomaOluo
This backlash is what happens when you directly challenge the status quo. It has no need to fight something that isn‚Äôt a threat. The response isn‚Äôt to pull back and ask for more later because this fight will always be waiting for us @IjeomaOluo
‚ÄúI am not interested in how I am written in the history books but about what books my children will be able to write‚Äù @IjeomaOluo
I know that history will not look on me or any of us completely kindly because of the compromises we‚Äôve had to make with real human consequences. Our goal should be to hasten this irrelevance @IjeomaOluo
‚ÄúAs a writer and an activist my goal is to make myself irrelevant one day‚Äù @IjeomaOluo
When you have a reaction to real change you don‚Äôt lessen that reaction by asking for less change @IjeomaOluo
When people advocate compromise they‚Äôre ignoring how hard many are working to maintain the status quo and the oppression of others. They‚Äôre working to make it easier and more efficient to oppress others @IjeomaOluo
The compromises that we need to be making are with those who want to push past us, who see further. Even if you can‚Äôt make the change you should always be looking for openings to make the change @IjeomaOluo
What teachers and others in systems  can do is work to empower students so they disrupt and make the systems work harder @IjeomaOluo
When a student asked me how to get her teachers talk about intersectionality. I told her teachers signed on to certain rules and are also scared sometimes. So while your teacher may not be able to lead the discussion she can facilitate your doing it and you can give her cover
There are certain people who are always asked to be the compromised @IjeomaOluo
We are making decisions now about what matters most and who matters most. There is no compromise so great that will protect us from looking in the eyes of those that we told to wait whose lives we comprised away @IjeomaOluo
Our system protects us against new tyrannies but protects old tyrannies of a country built on genocide, slavery, and exclusion of half the population @IjeomaOluo
But there are certain advantages to a stagnant unchanging system in that it protects against tyranny. We see the positives in how difficult it is to get anything done right now @IjeomaOluo

The 2016 elected happened with mass online harassment which silenced political discourse
When Hillary and trump were placed in stark contrast in a debate without any media interpretation her numbers went up
There‚Äôs a timidity in the media in fear of insulting trump voters. In their stories they seem to think the Midwest is all white middle aged men who are former industrial workers
Religiosity in the US is often rooted in strong man syndrome and obedience to men. This is not just about religion but a certain strain of evangelicalism that can be lured into the trump camp and become compliant
If we keep looking for saviors we‚Äôre never found to achieve a real democracy. We have to think for ourselves @sarahkendzior
‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm on tv you know we‚Äôre in trouble‚Äù is said because @sarahkendzior is an expert in authoritarian regimes
The people who never saw trump coming are the people who weren‚Äôt the targets of trump. ‚ÄúNo one saw this coming‚Äù erases the people he was targeting and saw him
80% of the media is white men who don‚Äôt experience the same daily discrimination who are surprised by trump and are optimistic that he will pivot
‚ÄúPeople call me an alarmist but fine I‚Äôm alarmed!‚Äù @sarahkendzior

T visas and U visas could be given to human trafficking victims but under 2000 are issued each year and are restricted
The Trafficking Victim Protection Act is currently not enforced in every state
Once a child turns 18 they are no longer considered a trafficked child. They are then considered a prostitute
The average age for a trafficked child in the US is 8
We must create vocational training for those that have been trafficked
Leverage globalization to address global poverty, gender inequality, and oppressive cultural norms
We must boycott companies that use trafficked and forced labor to make products

Family planning is preventative healthcare #WinWithWomen
Women dominated industries like service or care work are less likely to provide health insurance
Women are 10x more likely to take time off from work when children are sick and are significantly more likely to be caregivers for elderly family members. This leads to loss of wages, work, and healthcare
Despite most women working they still do most of the unpaid home work and are still more likely to be dependent on their husbands for healthcare coverage. 1 in 4 women lose their healthcare upon divorce

There‚Äôs no such thing as ‚ÄúPost‚Äù in post traumatic stress disorder for so many because it implies there‚Äôs a time without trauma for women and marginalized communities fighting for civil rights
Until we deal with disability issues in progressive spaces we will lose important people
Fighting day after day with little result is trauma. Anxiety and depression exacerbated by social justice work is a disability issue
Constantly resisting exacerbates our conditions
We don‚Äôt talk about the intersections of activism, trauma, and disability. John Lewis sustained multiple brain injuries during the civil rights movement
People with disabilities are the canary in the coal mine for discrimination. Those in prison, killed by police, women who are sexually assaulted, are unemployed, are all more likely to be represented in the disability community

In 2010 black people were nearly four times as likely to be arrested on charges of marijuana possession as whites, even though they use the drug at about the same rate and legalization has barely made a dent in those disparities /4 #420day
States are moving towards legalization but not vacating convictions. 39 states have legalized marijuana for recreational or medicinal purposes. The legal marijuana industry raked in $9 bil in sales last year but there is no money in letting people out of prison /3 #420day
@vmsoutherland &amp; Johanna Steinberg of @BronxDefenders write "As white people exploit the changing tide on marijuana, the racism that drove its prohibition is ignored. So are the consequences for black communities, where the war on drugs is most heavily waged." /2 #420day
While many are enjoying #420day and happily tweeting Happy 4/20 it's important to think about the legal ramifications for many and that even with discussions of decriminalization and legalization white people are the ones who benefit while black people remain in jail. Thread /1

‚ÄúI welcome your help any way you can give it‚Äù @SenFeinstein
There‚Äôs a pride among women. When Hillary does well we do well. There‚Äôs a paving the way @SenFeinstein
‚ÄúWomen are helped by other women‚Äù @SenFeinstein
The paving that @HillaryClinton did and the unique punishment she got for her efforts is something that all of us have to think about because we have to be able to take it too @SenFeinstein
A great model of work/life balance is @SenGillibrand. She‚Äôs raising two young boys in DC and handled it really well. Everyone has to make their own decision about it @SenFeinstein
My own view is that in this business you ‚Äúearn your spurs.‚Äù Start local and build a record and then run for higher office @SenFeinstein
The women are running today because they believe they have the talent and responsibility to accomplish our values @SenFeinstein #WinWithWomen #Midterms2018
The big thing is that at least one house become democratic which will make a huge difference in what‚Äôs accomplished and will stem the president @SenFeinstein #Midterms2018
The only way you can change things is by changing the control @SenFeinstein #Midterms2018
You shouldn‚Äôt be able to use things like Facebook to commit a crime or bully people which has caused suicides. Tech companies need to provide some oversight on their platforms to stop crimes, foreign election interference @SenFeinstein
We have intelligence to show how the Russian company IRA took an issue and used it to turn people against each other @SenFeinstein
On Facebook: these companies need to fix their platforms. They act like they‚Äôre benign-they‚Äôre not benign. If tech does not make changes we‚Äôll have to regulate @SenFeinstein
The right to control our own body is a right worth fighting for because it can be life or death @SenFeinstein
When I was in college a young woman killed herself because she was pregnant, we also passed the plate so a woman could go to Tijuana so she could get an abortion. People don‚Äôt remember what it was like before Roe. We don‚Äôt want to go back. @SenFeinstein
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not blocking any bill that protects Mueller...‚Äù https://t.co/vkvYKMh5W5
You have to stand for something and I try to @SenFeinstein
We had an agreement to take money out of a huge nuclear weapon to modernize a smaller weapon. Trump stopped that agreement. I made a big stink and said I wouldn‚Äôt vote for a bill that didn‚Äôt include that agreement. Getting tough is important which was a big learning experience
The senate functions on the basis of seniority so once you‚Äôre there you can start using that power. Women are finally gaining that seniority @SenFeinstein
I sat down at a table with leadership at a big bank and all 12 people were men. I commented and they told me to come back in 6 months. I did and the table was different @SenFeinstein
Every male boss knows now it‚Äôs hands off. Women are really denigrated by sexual harassment. Women are now serious members of the workforce which is changing the network #Metoo @SenFeinstein
It‚Äôs really important that we as women be strong. There‚Äôs a big generational change with things like #MeToo. Women are coming forward and looking past the fear of things like losing their job @SenGillibrand is a firebrand for this. Things are changing. @SenFeinstein
What the president has done with Bolton is go right to his hardcore conservative base. That‚Äôs not healthy because Bolton thinks just like trump. None of us need sycophants @SenFeinstein
On John Bolton: I‚Äôm worried about it. Occasionally I read his column and it‚Äôs always with a startled view @SenFeinstein
Im a big Lautenberg fan @SenFeinstein
Within 2 weeks we should have taken action to make it impossible to fire someone in this position. We need this because if the president can fire someone in this position...(no one should be above the law) @SenFeinstein
We have a bipartisan bill in committee to protect Mueller and it‚Äôs to be scheduled for Thursday @SenFeinstein
The majority party knows the problem and on an individual basis will admit the problem but so far not publicly (on Rosenstein and Mueller) @SenFeinstein
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a hard time. I have never known a harder time‚Äù @SenFeinstein
There‚Äôs a lot of talk that if trump moves in Syria is when he‚Äôll fire Rosenstein or Mueller @SenFeinstein
It‚Äôs not so easy to respond to chemical attacks because the components are kept separately and if you bomb them they will come together and kill a lot of people @SenFeinstein #SyriaCrisis
There‚Äôs only so much the electorate will take @SenFeinstein
With respect to this president it‚Äôs a revolving door. Usually the president creates a team and that team gets well known on the Hill with stability. My own sense is things are going to come apart viscerally. What the results from that are I don‚Äôt know at this stage @SenFeinstein
In terms of the power base of Washington all 3 branches of govt are controlled by republicans so the president has a base of support. If one house becomes democratic the whole power base will change. This election is critical for that @SenFeinstein #Midterms2018
An audience member comments that @SenFeinstein has been an inspiration and a shoulder to stand on because today 3 women are vying to be the mayor of San Francisco. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever leave us‚Äù (we agree!)

When all is say and done I think it‚Äôs going to be a very interesting year @SenFeinstein
The intelligence committee is doing an investigation with the advantage of access to all the intelligence @SenFeinstein
We have an investigation going on obstruction of justice and possible collusion with Russia with the election. The republicans want another investigation into Hillary @SenFeinstein
I think the investigation is likely to come to a conclusion very shortly. And I hope it is because the opposition is revving up @SenFeinstein
Mueller is clearly respected by everybody and he is a solid professional. @SenFeinstein
I think we‚Äôre in a very dangerous time and people need to speak out @SenFeinstein
Yes, I do believe he‚Äôs doing tremendous damage. We‚Äôve never had a president this erratic and narcissistic. The intent is that this is a govt that should serve him which is a myopic and different view of the presidency which should serve the people @SenFeinstein
This bill bans 205 specific guns so people can‚Äôt say ‚Äúyou‚Äôve banned our guns‚Äù the question then is ‚Äúwell what is your gun‚Äù @SenFeinstein
I have 29 cosponsors. Unfortunately they‚Äôre all democratic. We need republicans on the bill. I‚Äôm trying to convince Grassley to at least have a hearing. I can also wait for a criminal justice bill and push for an amendment @SenFeinstein on #GunReform
‚ÄúWe May just get this new bill done with the help of teenage America. We‚Äôre not going to leave the country awash with guns. This is my top priority.‚Äù @SenFeinstein #GunReform
For 10 years the assault weapons ban was law and deaths went down. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm determined to do it again‚Äù @SenFeinstein #GunReform
The day the assault weapons ban sunset smith and Wesson put their version of the assault weapon on the market. Now there are 1.5 million weapons of war @SenFeinstein

Civics 101: ranking member means you‚Äôre the longest party member on a committee

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let anyone else put a stop to your dreams. It‚Äôs the best form of revenge to show you won‚Äôt be undermined or stopped from achieving your future. I hope my legacy has contributed to that in some small way‚Äù @HillaryClinton
‚ÄúI want to see more young women supported in their workplaces, in their families, and in the political arena. The backlash cannot be allowed to undermine our progress or individual women having the courage to keep going‚Äù @HillaryClinton
@HillaryClinton sees her Beijing ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs Rights Are Human Rights‚Äù speech as a major part of her legacy as well as showing little girls not to let others determine your self worth or future. Young girls and all women need to believe in themselves in the face of society battering

NYC human rights law is the strongest workplace protection in the country. People in NYC should know their protections and utilize it. It also allows for punitive settlements to deter future actions #MeToo #TimesUp
There has been a lot of success using restorative justice for non carceral accountability for sexual assault #MeToo #TimesUp
Critical race theory is a great way to think through disruptive legal practices. Equality doesn‚Äôt equal equity. #TimesUp #MeToo
‚ÄúNeutrality‚Äù usually means the patriarchy. The ‚Äúreasonable person‚Äù standard usually means the usual man. Juries should have to put themselves in the place of a woman in that situation and the standard should be subjective. That‚Äôs why women‚Äôs spaces are so needed #MeToo #TimesUp
@TIMESUPLDF has raised over 20 mil but that is just the beginning of what‚Äôs needed to do this work. The vast majority of people doing this work are women and we can‚Äôt always ask women to do unpaid labor. Donate here https://t.co/LUzXjT03dm #TimesUp #MeToo
@UrbanJustice has a project for sex worked advocacy and @SRLP works for LGBT advocacy #MeToo #TimesUp
Conversations about consent and coercion need to start early. Children should be given the opportunity to say no to physical touching from adults #TimesUp #MeToo
Rape, sexual assault, coercive sexual interactions are on a spectrum and we need a spectrum of remedies. We need non criminal solutions to address not criminal situations #MeToo #TimesUp
There is work being done @kinseyinstitute to better understand the fight or flight or FREEZE response to danger. It is a biological response that makes people freeze in the face of assault  #MeToo #TimesUp
The only way to stop assault is to stop the perpetrators. There‚Äôs no information, empowerment, or preparation that can stop assault. It‚Äôs never the fault of the person being assaulted #TimesUp #MeToo
Honor the women who came before and include them and build on their work #TimesUp #MeToo
When people are invited into allyship they often have to reckon with their own past trauma or past actions and it can be a painful process #TimesUp #MeToo
Some of the pushback from women is often in them having to face their own past trauma #MeToo #TimesUp
Voting matters! Run for office! Think nationally and work locally. #TimesUp #MeToo #Midterms2018 #WinWithWomen
NY needs to have more progressive laws protecting women from sexual assault and in the workplace. Support @NYGovCuomo Women‚Äôs and Girls initiatives to get them through the NY legislature #TimesUp #MeToo
A reason #TimesUp is legally focused is that abusers had very powerful lawyers churning out cease and desist orders silencing women for decades #MeToo
This is a world that movements are being embraced and needed. If we want things to change we have to do it #MeToo #TimesUp
#TimesUp started when a bunch of really angry women got in a room #MeToo
#TimesUp¬† is also anti-racist work because it‚Äôs so tied to labor and WOC in the workplace. #MeToo
To be allies people need to engage in a lot of listening and show curiosity. Ask questions if you‚Äôre not completely sure what something means. This can be true for women as well to learn the experiences of other communities #MeToo #TimesUp
Men can‚Äôt do the ‚ÄúPence rule‚Äù to avoid liability. It‚Äôs illegal and gender discrimination. This is men weaponizing #MeToo against us. #TimesUp
Even if you think you will never use it document everything. Recap conversations. Get the rape kit. Knowing you have the information is empowering even if you will never seek action #MeToo #TimesUp
The toll of activism and awareness can be grueling and exhausting so people should feel permission to take time to recharge for self care without feeling they‚Äôre abandoning the movement #TimesUp #MeToo
Assault exists to maintain power and privilege and to keep others down. We can‚Äôt go too far in disrupting it because you can‚Äôt go too far in disrupting systems of oppression #MeToo #TimesUp
If you‚Äôre at work and aren‚Äôt ready to name someone a good way to start the conversation is to suggest general sexual harassment training for the office #MeToo #TimesUp
It‚Äôs offensive to ask if #MeToo or #TimesUp has gone too far because no other movements get asked that. This movement has not gone too far.
People are reframing their stories during #MeToo after hearing others name the experiences to call them sexual assault or intimate partner violence #TimesUp
If you don‚Äôt name something you can‚Äôt fight it. Calling an experience sexual assault or rape is a step towards healing. There is power in a movement of seeing ourselves in each other‚Äôs stories and naming the trauma #TimesUp #MeToo
Settlement offers can provide a small amount of healing because it shows the abuser doesn‚Äôt want the story to come out and acknowledges something happened #MeToo #TimesUp
Women often are scared to use their insurance for treatment because their abusers might see the bills or records come to their house. Seeking treatment can come at great risk #MeToo #TimesUp
To survive trauma doesn‚Äôt always mean you have PTSD but trauma can cause a wide range of symptoms that seem subtle but are completely disruptive. We need better accessible systems for people to heal without accessibility to psychologists #MeToo #TimesUp
Coercive sexual encounters is a type of grooming that many kinds of sexual predators use. It creates a lot of shame in part because women don‚Äôt feel they‚Äôve necessarily been raped #TimesUp #MeToo
@TIMESUPLDF was getting 600 requests a day. They handle all kinds of cases including defending women who are sued for sharing their #MeToo stories #TimesUp

We must stand with #DACADreamers and protect their status in the US. We cannot allow racism to win in further marginalizing women and immigrant youth. Make sure to follow @aclu's new campaign for more info.
It seems Trump's racism is the biggest factor in a desire to end #DACA "...a plausible inference that racial animus towards Mexicans and Latinos was a motivating factor in the decision to end DACA," U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup /7 https://t.co/lUWbE6Mz5s
#DACA recipients are also buying cars, purchasing their first homes, and even creating new businesses. 72% of the top 25 Fortune 500 companies employ DACA recipients and 97% of respondents to a DACA study are currently employed or enrolled in school /6 https://t.co/hbLYZffBD0
We know that #DACA also is an economically sound policy w/ recipients making contributions to the economy, including earning higher wages, which translates into higher tax revenue and economic growth that benefits all Americans /5
#DACA women had parents sacrificed so their children could get treatment, are women w/ nothing to go back to, women attending college and working for advocacy groups, community organizers, and more. They are real people who will be deeply hurt w/o #DACA @bustle @everydaycaitlin
Ending #DACA would wipe out work permits for more than 800,000 immigrants which further economically marginalizes immigrant youth but also leaves them with no recourse if they are being harassed, experiencing DV, or discriminated against /3 #DACADreamers https://t.co/UQjtCxLBvC
As @NationalNOW states "How many young domestic violence victims will be silenced for fear of deportation? What workplace discrimination will young women endure if they are working off the books? How many sexual assaults will occur without consequences for the perpetrator?" /2
A day before the March 5th deadline #DACADreamers are marching on DC to make their voices heard. As the @ACLU launches a new campaign to fight for #DACA let's remember that the majority of DACA recipients are women and under the age of 25 #Dreamers #DreamAct #DACADeal /1 https://t.co/Tl615zLV52

RT @letat_lechat: GREAT THREAD. #ImWithDianne #IStandWithFeinstein https://t.co/U9Y1mgMmpk
We know what's up. #WinWithWomen https://t.co/uzrugG7vpV
We need to hold our elected representatives accountable and policy discussions are always fair game. However we must respect a longstanding female senator with decades of accomplishments and a lifetime of breaking gender barriers. #ImWithDianne #RepresentationMatters
On January 9, 2018 Feinstein dealt a huge blow to republicans denying Russian involvement in our election by releasing the Fusion GPS transcript https://t.co/NZm71Q9u3r
Feinstein is a strong supported of the #ACA and has worked to expand #CHIP, increase Medicaid rebate for producing generic drugs, negotiate bulk purchases for Medicare prescription drugs, and allow patients to sue HMOs &amp; collect punitive damages,
#GunReform is a personal issue for Feinstein after she discovered the bodies of Harvey Milk and George Moscone. She authored the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban and introduced a new one in 2013 that unfortunately failed to pass https://t.co/KLR20nEJtm
Feinstein is the 1st &amp; only woman to have chaired the Senate Rules Committee and (2007‚Äì2009) the Select Committee on Intelligence (2009 to 2015) She is also the only woman to have presided over a U.S. presidential inauguration. Feinstein is now the longest serving female senator
Feinstein succeeded Moscone as Mayor of San Francisco as the 1st woman to hold that position. In 1992 Feinstein &amp; Barbara Boxer were elected to the senate on the same ballot. They were the 1st women CA senators. In 2012 she claimed the record for the most popular votes w/ 7.75m
Dianne Feinstein began her career in 1970 when she was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. She was the 1st female president of the board in 1978 when Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk were assassinated. Feinstein discovered Milk's &amp; and announced his death https://t.co/um8yMAAgD8
CA Dems declined to endorse @SenFeinstein for senate this past weekend calling for "new blood." Before we dismiss the 84 year old senator who broke gender barriers by becoming the first woman senator from California, let's look at Dianne Feinstein's long history #ImWithDianne https://t.co/kB5a12s75W

Women are a huge part of #environmentaljustice and often have the worst or first effects of toxins and pollution on their children and their bodies. Women running for office at ever level including local boards will help make enormous change #ElectWomen #RepresentationMatters /7
The situation in #Flint shows the effects of policy that thinks "big government is bad" &amp; we should "run government like a business." Women bathing their children brought the situation to light and fought to protect their community. "Women can have an enormous impact" @RheaSuh /6
"We might not have the power of government right now but we still have the purchasing power and the power of individual choice." @RheaSuh. We can change industry and affect change through conscious consumerism #environmentalhealth /5
The answer is #environmentaljustice alliances between marginalized communities and workers. #GreenEnergy is better for the economy, job growth, emissions, and industry. It protects fisherman, laborers, and so many more. Clean air and drinking water is not a partisan issue /4
"The Courts are an effective means of resistance where science and facts matter." Recently @NRDC won in federal court to ensure emissions standards go into effect saving billions of dollars and protecting air quality /3

To help provide tampons to women in prison support the Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act in the Senate. Also support orgs like #ThePrisonProject @I_Support_Girls @HelpingWomen1 #ItsBloodyTime #tampontax https://t.co/Scox476WBS
Families for Justice and Healing found that many federal prisons aren't complying with the order and the memo guaranteeing free tampons and pads expires on August 1, 2018, and it‚Äôs not clear what will happen after that. @Rewire_News #ItsBloodyTime /7 https://t.co/BdQ5JWkglw
Federal prisons began providing free pads and tampons to women in August 2017. Colorado allocated $40,000 for prisons to purchase &amp; dispense free sanitary products. NYC passed a law making pads and tampons free at schools, homeless shelters, and jails #ItsBloodyTime /6
The bill introduced by @AthenaSalman passed the panel 5-4 and will move forward. Salman said an additional $80,000 would provide unlimited sanitary products for all of the women in need while the US spends $71 billion overall on prisons #ItsBloodyTime /5 https://t.co/Ixh8YBMg73
The all male panel hearing on the bill questioned whether this was really an issue or if women could be trusted with unlimited pads and tampons. What if they shove them all down the toilet? The panel seemed surprised that they really had to spend a hearing talking about pads /4
Additionally if a woman bleeds on her uniform she can face punishment or get charged with contraband for trying to fashion pads into tampons or other hacks to get through a period #ItsBloodyTime /3 https://t.co/NxJz6LAlb7
Currently female inmates in AZ only get 12 pads per month. For the additional needed products they must ask a guard for permission and use their commissary money to pay for them. This means women are forced to choose between tampons and a call home #ItsBloodyTime /2
Tampons &amp; pads are a political issue because men don't understand how menstruation works. Tampons are taxed as a luxury &amp; are desperately needed in women's shelters. Their numbers are regulated in prison but an AZ law could help #tampontax #ItsBloodyTime /1

Bills like these also aren't supported by the public. 61% of all voters say abortion should be legal after 20 weeks. Plus, Democrats (78%), Republicans (62%), and Independents (71%) say this is the wrong issue for lawmakers to be spending time on. #NoAbortionBan /7 https://t.co/jOLTfe13Fa
These bills are part of an agenda to try and ban all abortions by consistently moving back the date of legal abortions and further criminalizing the practice. It also forces women already making a very difficult decision to deal with more judgment and legal ramifications /6
The law is addressing abortions that are very uncommon. Nearly 99% of abortions happen before 21 weeks. The ones that happen after are usually due to serious health problems in the fetus of the mother. These cases should be between a woman and her doctor https://t.co/UkGZfSPE5y
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs...conclusive evidence that shows that the neurologic structures in a fetus aren‚Äôt...working until much further along in pregnancy, we think even the third trimester‚Äù said Jennifer Conti, a clinical prof &amp; OB-GYN at Stanford #NoAbortionBan /4 https://t.co/RFLubrTxry
The claim that fetuses can feel pain at 20 weeks is completely not supported by science. "The science shows that based on gestational age, the fetus is not capable of feeling pain until the third trimester" (27 weeks). #NoAbortionBan /3 https://t.co/LgpTgtkFso
Currently fetal viability is the standard for abortions which sets the time at around 24 weeks. Fetal viability refers to a fetus living outside the womb. Laws must pass a stricter standard to not apply an "undue burden" to women seeking an abortion before 24 weeks #NoAbortionBan
The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act is back as the Senate is set to vote on a 20 week abortion ban today. This bill is based on fake science that fetuses can feel pain after 20 weeks. Read this thread to learn more. #NoAbortionBan /1

If you are a victim of human trafficking contact the National Human Trafficking Hotline (NHTH), at 1-888-373-7888 or text HELP or INFO to BeFree (233733). Ask yourself these questions to identify #HumanTrafficking victims. #HumanTraffickingAwarenessDay https://t.co/Rl2mzbXuVR
According to @humanrights1st in 2018 the US should reauthorize the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. Last authorized in 2013 it expired in September 2017. It also should enforce the ban on goods made with forced labor. #HumanTraffickingAwarenessDay /19 https://t.co/1Er6c9CR3G
The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act also banned goods made with forced labor from entering the U.S. market and worked to stop the use of forced labor by companies that hold government contracts effective at combating #humantrafficking. #HumanTraffickingAwarenessDay /18
In 2000, Congress enacted the Trafficking Victims Protection Act to build a better system of laws to combat trafficking. In 2015 Congress passed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act to expand the capacity of the U.S. govt to help survivors of human trafficking. /17
2,105 of the 7,621 #humantrafficking cases recorded in 2016 involved U.S. citizens #HumanTraffickingAwarenessDay /16
According to @Polaris_Project, as of June 2017, the National Human Trafficking Hotline had received 13,897 calls that year. These calls represent reports of potential trafficking cases or come directly from people seeking help. /15 #HumanTraffickingAwarenessDay
The National Human Trafficking Resource Center says that more than 4,000 cases of sex trafficking were reported in the US but numbers don't tell the full story as many #HumanTrafficking victims are silenced #HumanTraffickingAwarenessDay /14 https://t.co/vZeISvyK0C

@UnchainedAtLast found that between 1995 and 2012, judges allowed 178 children between the ages of 10 and 15 to marry in New Jersey. From this sample, a number were children married to adults. #HumanTraffickingAwarenessDay /12
In the US, only 10 states have legislation that directly address forced marriage. Duress, threat, physical abuse and death threats by family members constitute force and coercion. #HumanTraffickingAwarenessDay /11
In 2003, the International Center for Research on Women estimated that over 51 million girls. They are most common in impoverished countries but there are still many cases in more affluent nations #HumanTraffickingAwarenessDay /10
Because many victims of sex trafficking are forced to work as prostitutes or in some form of sex work, when sex trafficking victims are caught, they might be detained and prosecuted for criminal activity. #HumanTraffickingAwarenessDay /9
In the United States, any minor under the age of 18 engaged in commercial sex acts is automatically considered a victim of sex trafficking under the law. Worldwide, it's estimated that there are 4.5 million victims of sex trafficking #HumanTraffickingAwarenessDay /8
@EndSlaveryNow estimates that there are 20.9 Million people trapped in some form of slavery today. Those types include domestic servitude, sex trafficking, forced labor, bonded labor, child labor, and forced marriage #HumanTraffickingAwarenessDay /7 https://t.co/lvfj7rSfgW
Armed militia groups are a huge cause of #HumanTrafficking coercing women and girls into marriages or sexual slavery and pressing men and boys to act as forced labour or combatants particularly as child soldiers #HumanTraffickingAwarenessDay /6
Worldwide, 28% of trafficking victims are children, but children account for 62% in Sub-Saharan Africa &amp; 64% in Central America and the Caribbean. /5 #HumanTraffickingAwarenessDay
Women and girls are usually trafficked for marriage and sexual slavery but men and boys are trafficked into exploitative labour. This includes mining, being a soldier, and slavery. #HumanTraffickingAwarenessDay /4

The National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) is #VotingRights law aka the "Motor Voter Law" that was signed by Bill Clinton to make registering to vote easier. Today's case could remove someone from being registered for not voting frequently /15 https://t.co/qlLL3B4Ckh

Lawyers for Ohio SOS Jon Husted (R) will argue that the policy is necessary for voting list maintenance, while advocates for voters will say it violates the National Voter Registration Act and that states cannot deregister a voter by reason of the person‚Äôs failure to vote /13
From 2011-2016, Ohio purged roughly 1.2 million people from the rolls for voting infrequently. Surveys found that ‚Äúvoters have been struck from the rolls in Democratic-leaning neighborhoods at roughly twice the rate as in Republican neighborhoods." /12 https://t.co/5uJRSnLn9O

The court also stated a partisan gerrymander can violate the 1st Amendment and a person's right to free association (as it burdens voters who aren't republicans) as well as violating the Constitution's guarantee that a person chooses their representatives /7
In the 1st time a fed district court has struck down a congressional map for partisan gerrymandering, the opinion states the map violates the EPC bec it shows a successful effort to subordinate the interests of non-Republican voters &amp; entrench Republican reps in power /6

#SandyHook5yrs #Newtown https://t.co/TASfZXfE8Y
Federal protections are hampered by states not always reporting domestic abusers as well as loopholes in required background checks
The federal laws do not apply to many abusers who victimize non-spouse partners or to to abusers who victimize a family member other than a partner or child. Similar loopholes allow access to guns by convicted stalkers and abusers subject to domestic violence protective orders
federal law prohibits abusers who have been convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors from purchasing or possessing guns.but these laws have significant limitations which requires states to enact broader laws to protect people like the one proposed in NY
A study by @Everytown found that of every identifiable mass shooting between January 2009 and July 2014 found that 57% of them involved the killing of a family member, or a current or former intimate partner of the shooter
More than two-thirds of spouse and ex-spouse homicide victims between 1980 and 2008 were killed with firearms and in 2011, nearly two-thirds of women killed with guns were killed by their intimate partners
Abused women are five times more likely to be killed if their abuser owns a firearm, and domestic violence assaults involving a gun are 12 times more likely to end in death than assaults with other weapons or physical harm https://t.co/RkkKYLKMOO
One of the most helpful things we can do to prevent mass shootings is take #domesticviolence seriously and ensure we keep firearms out of anyone who commits a DV misdemeanor or felony #GunViolenceIsAWomansIssue #gunsense https://t.co/6pK4k7NGIN

The past few elections have shown that the Democratic Party can win when it mobilizes and pays attention to its base. 94% of #BlackWomen voted for @HillaryClinton, 92% voted for @RalphNortham, and 97% voted for @GDouglasJones. Converting Trump voters isnt how we win /12

The Green Party is very good on environmental issues but tend not to look at them in an intersectional way or have policies that can be well implemented. If you want to fight Trump's disastrous EPA policies Dems are the best bet https://t.co/ZhdCcTzcXY
So, let‚Äôs talk about policy. After all that is why we elect our leaders, right? We elect them to draw up, propose and implement policy to improve our community. (So why are we ignoring policy right now?) /10
3rd parties can be valuable when they propose issues and policy that might not be on the radar of the two major parties (e.g. unions, minimum wage). The major parties have the infrastructure and support to implement policies the 3rd party may not be able to do on their own /9
Some 3rd parties like the ‚ÄúKnow Nothing Party (renamed American Party in 1855) can be incredibly divisive and discriminatory. The Know Nothing party was nationalistic, anti-immigrant, and afraid of new customs (e.g. Nativism). /8 https://t.co/r3WOq9uOjb
Some 3rd parties are there just to ‚Äòrat f‚Äîk‚Äô a candidate by taking votes away from the two major parties. Roger Stone was very good at this. /7 https://t.co/j0LOA6UTE9
It may be effective in whipping up a frenzy of media attention (Gary Johnson, Jill Stein), but it has little to no policy accomplishments or coalition building. /6
3rd Parties tend to be issue oriented, some, like the Marijuana Party (self-explanatory) are mostly are single issue. Many 3rd parties usually revolve around an individual, or a ‚Äòcult of personality‚Äô. Once the personality goes away, so does the party /5
Since the beginning our country's inception, we‚Äôve always had revolving and evolving parties (the Federalists, Democratic-Republicans, National Republican aka Whig); this usually includes two dominate parties as well as 3rd parties /4
So here is a thread about our Country‚Äôs history with 3rd Parties and why forming a 3rd Party to unite us wont help as much as demanding policy that dismantles inequality, institutionalized racism and misogyny /3
Some of you have gone as far as saying:	 ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre going to join a 3rd party!‚Äù or ‚ÄúWe need a 3rd Party to unite the Nation.‚Äù /2
Some have expressed outrage this week on how Democrats handled the sexual harassment charges against two of its leaders:	‚ÄúDems didn‚Äôt call for ousting quick enough!‚Äù	‚ÄúCalled for ousting too quickly!‚Äù	‚ÄúIt was a GOP hit job!‚Äù	‚ÄúOust the women, that ousted the man!‚Äù (Really?) /1

@TIME Longterm dedicated efforts of activists eventually led to the 1994 passage of the Violence Against Women Act. Later reauthorizations eventually explicitly included immigrants, Native women, and same sex couples
@TIME Students effectively lobbied for one of the first campus-based rape crisis centers at the University of Maryland in 1972, a women‚Äôs studies program and rape crisis center at the University of Pennsylvania in 1973 and campus-wide prevention programs for the U of C system in 1976
@TIME The first rape crisis centers opened in 1972, and the Feminist Alliance Against Rape (FAAR) was formed in 1974. In 1975, Susan Brownmiller published "Against Our Will" acknowledging the systemic role of rape in maintaining the social order /14 https://t.co/4ittg0QHY3
@TIME ‚ÄúThe plight of Inez Garcia in 1974, Joanne Little in 1975, Yvonne Wanrow in 1976, and Dessie Woods in 1976, all victims of rape or assault who fought back, killed their assailants, and were imprisoned" brought the issue of rape front and center /13 https://t.co/EBGIRwwL9V
@TIME McGuire notes that 11 years later many involved in Taylor's defense participated in the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott, which was in many ways the last act of a decades-long struggle to protect black women, like Taylor, from sexualized violence and rape /12 https://t.co/MQVjjrSoNY
@TIME After meeting with Recy Taylor, Rosa Parks helped form the Committee for Equal Justice. Taylor had been kidnapped on her way home from church by seven armed white men who gang-raped and left her on the side of the road. 2 all-white grand juries refused to issue indictments /11
@TIME In "At The Dark End of the Street", Wayne State University historian Danielle McGuire argues that the history of Black women‚Äôs anti-rape activism must be understood as an integral part of the Civil Rights Movement /10
@TIME One of the earliest organized anti-rape efforts was women a group of African American women testified in front of congress after the Memphis riots in 1866. They testified that a white mob had committed gang rapes of at least 5 black women during the riots /9
@TIME According to Yale prof Crystal Feimster, the Lieber code was the first time black women were brought under legal protection and many women of all races were able to bring cases. Union military courts prosecuted at least 450 cases involving sexual crimes with women testifying /8
@TIME The order defined rape in women-specific terms as a crime against property, as a crime of troop discipline, and as a crime against family honor. Sexual violence was common to the wartime experience of Southern women, white and black. /7 https://t.co/2hEpDp1jNv
@TIME President Lincoln‚Äôs General Orders No. 100 declared that soldiers would ‚Äúacknowledge and protect, in hostile countries occupied by them, religion and morality; strictly private property; the persons of the inhabitants, especially those of women‚Äù (Article 37) /6
@TIME In her famous "Ain't I a Woman" speech, Sojourner Truth drew attention to the ways black women experienced both racism and sexism /5
@TIME In 1855 a slave named Celia was tried and convicted for killing her master after he had raped her for years. Celia was declared her master's property with no right to defend herself. The rape of black women and slaves was discussed by women in the abolition movement /4
@TIME Raped women might be punished themselves as an adulteress or a woman who brought dishonor on her family. For women to be believed they were required to provide witnesses and evidence that was not possible for them to produce /3
@TIME Historically rape as a crime was often treated as a property crime against a woman's husband or father. The punishment might be paying the bride price of the woman or even marrying her since she was "ruined" for marriage /2
Today @TIME announced their #TimePersonOfTheYear was the #SilenceBreakers of the #MeToo movement. This conversation was possible this year in large part due to the long historical work of of the anti-rape movement. They should be honored alongside the amazing women featured /1

@Hegemommy @Rewire_News Whatever the outcome of the #MasterpieceCakeshop case we must stay vigilant in fighting discrimination. We cannot allow so called "religious freedom" cases to justify individual discrimination. Follow @ACLU for more details on the case
@Hegemommy outlines the case for @Rewire_News and suggests that Kennedy will likely take a middle ground approach that doesn't fully protect LGBT people from discrimination w/ concerns for religious groups and civil rights legislation https://t.co/Q9VbSlvp7K

Lawyers for 15 minority religious orgs filed an amicus brief arguing that ruling against the Colorado law would put religious liberty at risk because non-discrimination laws often play an indispensable role in protecting the rights of religious communities https://t.co/yCNi6IJtTF
The baker's lawyers also argue that the Colorado law would require a black baker to make a cake for a KKK member, ignoring the fact that the KKK is not a protected class and therefore not specifically protected from discrimination. /5
Attorneys for the couple argue that the law does not violate free speech because as a commercial regulation, the law only affects free speech rights incidentally. It regulates a commercial exchange in a content-neutral way /4
Specifically lawyers for the conservative litigation advocacy organization Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), argue that requiring a baker to design cakes for a gay couple violates his free speech rights bec it forces a baker to communicate a message with which he disagrees /3
The conservative argument on behalf of the baker claims the Colorado law violates the baker's religious freedom. This is not a new argument and has been used in the past for things like not covering birth control in the Hobby Lobby case /2
Today #SCOTUS heard oral arguments on the #MasterpieceCakeshop case in which a baker is challenging a Colorado law that says it's discrimination to refuse to make a wedding cake for a gay couple. The ruling of this case could have far reaching implications for civil rights law /1

@ChuckGrassley @DMRegister @RepBarbaraLee The Estate Tax is just one example of the way the #GOPTaxScam prioritizes the rich and hurts the working and middle class. Assuming the rich will invest ruins the American economy time and time again. It's time we learned from history
@ChuckGrassley @DMRegister @RepBarbaraLee 4. Trickle down economics that values "investors" over "spenders" drives the economy into the ground and has been disproven. The estate tax keeps concentrated wealth in the hands of a few. "Spenders" support the economy by spending money on American made products like liquor
@ChuckGrassley @DMRegister @RepBarbaraLee 3. Women make up much of the workforce and still only earn 80c on the dollar. 7/10 mothers are in the workforce. We are "spenders" driving the economy not commodities to buy. https://t.co/mjb9lZNph0

@ChuckGrassley @DMRegister 1. Women aren't a commodity like liquor or movies. We aren't just here for your entertainment value.
