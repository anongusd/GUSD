@odetteroulette @cmclymer @yashar It's genuinely frightening to see all of this personal stuff being assigned to us when all we're trying to do is hold the goddamned line.
@cmclymer @odetteroulette @yashar My point is Republicans are always the enemy because enough of them in numbers and oopsies, bye bye civil rights for all of us. A firing squad aimed at Dems is a boon to them and key to keeping them in power.

@cmclymer @odetteroulette @yashar Did you not watch the whole video? She was being honest with them. That's what someone who respects kids does. Sees them as human beings who deserve the truth.
@cmclymer @odetteroulette @yashar That would naturally piss off any follower who has looked up to you for your integrity and ability to see past bullshit

@TomForUtah When you say you want them all to resign you are saying you think a Republican is acceptable. The leadership have done things in their lives which have been racist and sexist. Republicans enshrine these concepts into law. Kirk Cox is not a moral alternative.
@TomForUtah Tom please do not use my tweets to reinforce your belief that they all need to resign. I have said I disagree with that. I do not want to be part of the case you are building against the VA leadership from your twitter account.

@smelllikesugar I think we're going to need to see what Virginia wants, in that case. Whether forgiveness is granted and heads roll is ultimately up to them, but it seems silly to not try to appoint someone who is a Dem who hasn't done any of these things. At that rate, Northam may as well stay.

@smelllikesugar this doesn't really explain why he is a more logical choice than her. he's not. and it doesn't mean the end of his political career if he does this. it's a move that demonstrates loyalty to the party and an understanding of the harm caused. failure to pursue this path is idiotic.
@smelllikesugar We aren't calling for their heads, though. We are finding them a safe exit. They are still ours. Staying where they are when there is a different path will rot them on the vine and damage the party. I'm prepared to forgive them all but not if they willfully hurt the party.

RT @MarisaKabas: this country makes me sad.
@smelllikesugar If all it takes is Big League to destroy us we need to look at that. This is not a crisis where a band-aid is gonna cut it.
@smelllikesugar We've already fucked this up to the point where just picking the other  blackface guy isn't gonna feel like resolution. People immediately called on Northam to resign rather than just condemning the racism. I understand why but I think that reaction is part of why we're here.
@smelllikesugar eh, I'm not sure he handled it any better than the others. like, maybe a little, but it's proportional to how much attention he was getting. he came out only after seeing how poorly the other two men were handling their controversies.
I don't know the answer but I do know the GOP thinks they can destroy us this way.
Democrats need to deal with the reality that racism and sexism are bipartisan plagues. We need to look at how we react when our own fall from grace for either one of these sins. Our politicians are products of a toxic society we are trying to change.		Does forgiveness = approval?
I believe her. Yesterday Fairfax was praised for eloquently (I'm making a point about why he was praised by a lot of white people) lying about Tyson's own experience of the encounter. Really just beyond that he did that and so many people didn't find that alarming.

@fawfulfan I think he needs to resign but the earliest presses I saw for Northam to stay came from Republicans. Never Trumpers would like to see a good old boy like Northam survive a Dem party thrashing. They could relax for a beat.
so it was a good week to get "infanticide" trending. https://t.co/7n72glMN8N

There are white dudes on the left who insist they aren't racist but say in private the things Neeson &amp; Northam have said publicly. Not to excuse the racism of either man, but let's acknowledge that denial of racism by white ppl on the left is self serving rather than enlightened.

@jkfecke @nberlat @johnastoehr hey, super glad all the men here are so against racism but just gonna ask you all remember why he was targeted in the first place. this isn't about him. there's a path for them to outlaw abortion but they need narrative support and you are helping them to pave it
@johnastoehr I don't trust that this began with abortion so call it whatever the hell you want to.
@jkfecke Definitely not great for him if that's the case but I still wonder where they're going with this. Axios is not at the top of my 'media I trust' list.
@jkfecke So he had editorial control? I haven't seen that confirmed yet. I'm not defending the content of the page, but the GOP has been losing its shit over Northam for days. It's a little suspicious.
@jkfecke they're trying to tie racism to abortion for the umpteenth time.

@MaxBoot If you do have a good point in your article you NEED to explain what appears to be flippant callousness about genocide committed by our government. Unless you only want people who don't care about that kind of thing to read it.
@MaxBoot Why should anyone care about your article when you're defending your use of genocide-denying language? That does not recommend you in the slightest.

@lindaz333 @JillFilipovic In 2016 misogynist Bernie bros threatened &amp; intimidated women from speaking out. Sure, some of them were Russian bots but a lot of them were not. We ended up with Trump. Why? Because we behaved, as you are characterizing it, as "adults."		I have no intention of repeating that.

@kayser843 @rainybeaches99 @smashthesamurai @RepJayapal I'm not afraid of anything. You misread my pragmatism as caution.
@kayser843 @rainybeaches99 @smashthesamurai @RepJayapal If we are serious we need the Senate, which means doing what we can without it for the next 2 years while working to a big win in 2020. Honestly, if you can get Rs to vote for it I will own my wrongness, will be happy to. Just don't want people disappointed if we can't do it all.
@kayser843 @rainybeaches99 @smashthesamurai @RepJayapal I don't want to give up at all, I think there's danger in entering the legislation in a hostile environment and allowing the negative spin to take hold before it has a chance to pass.

@kayser843 @rainybeaches99 @smashthesamurai @RepJayapal They'll frame it in a way that'll sink it. Won't even be hard, as many pushing for this voluntarily identify as socialists.
