While we're discussing football shouldn't the final 4 be:	Clemson	Oklahoma	Georgia	F-22		Unlike the other 3 (and Alabama) the F-22 is undefeated on the field of battle...plus  combination of sensor capability, integrated avionics, and situational awareness it's better on offense. https://t.co/LcUYrslsIs

Precourt: if we don't expand our capabilities and replace shuttle with something bigger, we'll totally lose ability to lead in space.
Astronaut corps was balanced between pilots, flight engineers, and scientists/ doctors (mission specialists).
Were building protective systems to lengthen the time you can stay in space. Strengthening and bone density are priority.
Space Launch System will be new US space capability. Targeting moon, mars, asteroids.
Space Shuttle weighed 5 million pounds and had 7.5 million pounds thrust.
Precourt: all navigation scripts had to be bi, sometimes Tri-lingual.
5 year period of MIR cooperation led to better cooperation between russian federation and US.
Worst happenings in space: Fire, Collision, and Depressurization. All can force abandonment and all happened on MIR 96-98.
#ISS is miniature, orbiting city, thanks to cooperation with russians. Precourt serrved as chief of #NASA presence in Star City, Russia.
Precourt flew 7 missions to MIR Space Station. Also flew aerial defense missions over E germany in early 80's, wagging wings w/ MIG pilots.
Col. Precourt docked a space shuttle with USSR 20 years after executing the final #Apollo mission during the Nixon admin.
