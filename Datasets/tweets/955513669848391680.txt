RT @Pontifex: God became a child to be closer to the men and women of every time, and to show us His infinite tenderness.
@Pontifex GOD IS LOVE,GODS LOVE IS IN THE HART OF MAN
RT @Pontifex: God walks along the dusty paths of our lives and responds to our longing for love and happiness by calling us to joy.
RT @Pontifex: Like the Magi, believers are led by faith to seek God in the most hidden places, knowing that the Lord waits for them there.
RT @Pontifex: Baptism is also called ‚Äòillumination‚Äô, because faith illuminates the heart and allows us to see things in a different light.
RT @Pontifex: Let us share the joy of our Christian brothers and sisters of the East who are celebrating Christmas today.
RT @Pontifex: Joy, prayer and gratitude are three ways that help us live authentically.
RT @Pontifex: A joyful soul is like healthy soil in which life can thrive and produce good fruit.

RT @Pontifex: We pray to God for the courage to ask forgiveness and to learn how to listen to what he is saying to us.
RT @Pontifex: Listening to religious teaching or learning a doctrine is not enough. What we want is to live as Jesus lived.
RT @Pontifex: The Gospel message is a source of joy: a joy that spreads from generation to generation and which we inherit.
RT @Pontifex: Every life counts: from the beginning to the end, from conception to natural death
RT @Pontifex: Praise to you, Lord, for this wonderful creation that is the Amazon people, and for all the biodiversity these lands contain!
RT @Pontifex: There is no better medicine to heal so many wounds than a heart capable of mercy.
RT @Pontifex: Don't waste time hiding your heart. Fill your life with the Holy Spirit!
RT @Pontifex: The Lord calls you today to travel with Him through the city, your city. He calls you to be His missionary disciple.
RT @Pontifex: I am grateful to all who have accompanied me on my pilgrimage to Chile and Peru in so many ways, especially with prayer.
RT @Pontifex: Prayer that purifies, strengthens and illuminates our path is like fuel for our journey towards full Christian unity.
