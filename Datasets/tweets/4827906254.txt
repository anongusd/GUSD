Where is the IG REPORT ???????
We have rules, regulations, laws - that seems to only apply to the common man- when the elites get caught- they can wiggle there way out of any trouble, lies,and destruction.  Double/triple standard- UN diplomats get executive privilege and we pay for them!!! GET RID OF UN in NY
In politics the code is  IF YOUR NOT DIRTY- WE WILL MAKE YOU DIRTY- Using many forms of media - has been working for years !!  Evil backers mask themselves behind media, books, etc., trying you convince you and take away any of your FREE THINKING and thoughts
Real question is- Is Twitter AFRAID of Laura Loomer??? and WHY??
Not one politician is poor- they start out with nothing and	leave as millionaires- double dipping with pension, social security,and secret bank accounts over seas- namely at "Island if Mann"
California want to help  "generosity begins at home"- NOT IN YOUR POCKETS***  know wonder there going broke!!- Follow the $ trail

@EddieDonovan I know your wrong  My father was in Tank Destroyers- with Patton,Omar Bradley and Montgomery- 3rd, 5th. Montgomery was stupid and too slow- but wanted all the glory and credit from these Generals- Britain had cracked enemy code but never shared info with us. UK dragged us into it
@EddieDonovan I disagree with your statement. If it weren't for these  Generals. Patton and MacArthur to save Britains Ass &amp; many BIG blinders during the war- they would have been taken over by the Germans-Patton an his 3rd &amp; 5th army were always there to pick up where others didn't dare-
