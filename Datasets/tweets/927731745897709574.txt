@NoNoNotNormal @DavidRunkel @SenatorTimScott Have a nice evening!
@NoNoNotNormal @DavidRunkel @SenatorTimScott Your responses are so jumbled, unconnected, and incoherent that there is simply no way to rationally respond.  I can't educate you on every subject regarding the history of politics in the US, and you just switch whenever you realize I am making a case from a factual basis.
@galaxiou @DavidRunkel @SenatorTimScott It was a town hall, CNN conducted it if I remember correctly.  I don't want to give my opinions on who makes the better case before you view it but it's on YouTube.  Have a watch for yourself (make sure it's the healthcare one)
@galaxiou @DavidRunkel @SenatorTimScott Did you by any chance watch the Tes Cruz and Bernie Sanders debate on this issue; if not I recommend it
@NoNoNotNormal @DavidRunkel @SenatorTimScott But see you aren't answering anything I'm asking, typical.  Here is a source, hopefully you won't tell me CNBC is conservative too, if you believe that there really is no hope for you.  https://t.co/43QQPSsZzq
@galaxiou @DavidRunkel @SenatorTimScott Once it is built this may be a more fair comparison, however I truly hope it won't be
@galaxiou @DavidRunkel @SenatorTimScott And where did I ever mention I liked him? Don't assume things. Let's say your assumption is correct though, I never said I liked him saying "Mexico would pay for it" but there isn't a wall yet, we are stuck with the horrid ACA still.
@galaxiou @DavidRunkel @SenatorTimScott Nobody respects anything Amir Khan says, and there are women who oppose abortion as well, as I said earlier allowing it anytime with no limitations in extremely negligent and condones homicide.  As we discussed earlier rapes and the mother dying due to child a case can be made
@NoNoNotNormal @DavidRunkel @SenatorTimScott The crash was caused by subprime mortgage lending, that's a known fact.  Bush had zero to do with creating those subprime mortgages
RT @SenatorTimScott: Our #TaxReform proposal helps working families. Period. #TaxDebate
@galaxiou @DavidRunkel @SenatorTimScott If it's repealed and replaced properly it is a step forward.  It is unfair to fine people for not having a certain plan, and it is unfair to blatantly lie to the American people to try and gain support for your legislation "everyone can keep their doctor" was a blatant lie
@NoNoNotNormal @DavidRunkel @SenatorTimScott You have none, and I'm pretty sure if I listed SPLC you would have the same response
@NoNoNotNormal @DavidRunkel @SenatorTimScott Kansas didn't implement the deductions overtime that's why it didn't fully work.  A plan like Gillespies or in the House is different than Kansas.  Any economic plan implemented poorly is a negative I can agree on that
@galaxiou @DavidRunkel @SenatorTimScott I speak for myself, nobody else but if faced with the absolutes of none or for everyone I need to side with the numbers.  But I don't see it as those absolutes, people just need to get in the same page
@NoNoNotNormal @DavidRunkel @SenatorTimScott 1. Still no sources	2. Don't talk to me about national debt when #44 added massively compared  to the total accumulated by #1-#43		https://t.co/ZJ8ZveczYL
@galaxiou @DavidRunkel @SenatorTimScott See but that's the problem, it's poor people who are hurt too! ACA is broken, and the new plan isn't perfect either, but to say the ACA is amazing with little to no flaws is crazy.  And to say it was advertised honestly would be a blatant lie
@galaxiou @DavidRunkel @SenatorTimScott Rape and situations where the Mother will die are fair arguments to make, and there are republicans who believe those are exceptions.  However when given the polar opposites of "abortion anytime" or "never" they choose "never" because they don't believe in senseless killing
@galaxiou @DavidRunkel @SenatorTimScott I'm sorry for your loss, but did you see me say that I love the new plan? But the ACA forced people to change their doctors in large numbers (despite being told they wouldn't), pay higher rates and deductibles making insurance harder to use... ACA is not great at all
@zardozrocks @DavidRunkel @SenatorTimScott I don't like the idea of raising the debt, but it at least proposes a solution to many economic problems Americans and American business late and small have

@galaxiou @DavidRunkel @SenatorTimScott One talks about the fact that a child is a human life and should be valued.  Adoptions are an option too.  If you are talking about situations where it is a mothers life OR the child's obviously there is a discussion to be had and a case to be made, but not for connivence!

@DarylHadd @DavidRunkel @SenatorTimScott A plan being better than what exists today doesn't make it perfect, and there are ten years to find a solution to an issue like that.  Economic boost from lower corporate taxes will no doubt have taken effect by then

@galaxiou @DavidRunkel @SenatorTimScott Many different issues that deserve I dividual attention or debate.  I doubt we will agree on abortion because democrats and republicans aren't ever actually talking about the same thing when it comes to that.
@DavidRunkel @SenatorTimScott https://t.co/Ma3ri35rp5 no plan is perfect, the trick is finding how to truly benefit the most people.  In most states (perhaps not yours I don't know where you live and wont ask) the new deductions will outweigh the state income tax deduction, especially for those with families.

@appalachianheel @RealMarquis7 @joegretchen94 @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan This is hilarious, "never"!.  If not implemented correctly the impact can be devastating, but that is true with any economic policy.  That's why it's taken as long as it has to get to the floor, it has been their top priority for a long time, the plan will do. more good than harm
@appalachianheel @RealMarquis7 @joegretchen94 @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan Not everything is as cut and dry, or one sided as you make it seem.  The honest argument is in States with insanely high income taxes it hurts, and in states with more moderate to low income tax rates it helps.  It helps businesses (who hire people by the way) universally.
@appalachianheel @RealMarquis7 @joegretchen94 @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan The tax plan helps individuals, and especially families, in many states where the new deductions outweigh what was gained from deducting state income taxes.  It will help overall economic growth in the United States, especially when corporations hire American workers.
