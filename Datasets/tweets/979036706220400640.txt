The people benefitting from this bill are middle and working class families. CNN’s Jake Tapper  pointed that out and even self-described socialist Bernie Sanders admitted middle class taxes would be cut. The next step is to make the Trump tax cuts permanent.
If I were a Democrat, I would be very nervous. The good economic news  keeps coming and the Left just has a hatred for Trump and nothing else.  That’s not a platform for winning elections.
Trump is getting America back to work &amp; a lot of this news can be traced back to the tax reform package. It’s created a better  job-creating and investing climate. Democrats thought this bill could be an albatross around the neck of the GOP.
223,000 jobs in May &amp; black unemployment hit a record low.The overall unemployment rate is now at 3.8 percent, an18-year low. In terms of white &amp; black unemployment numbers, which are usually miles apart, they’ve never been closer.  Every Dem Rep voted against Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act

Swalwell has been asleep at the switch talking about Russia while important decisions were being made about transportation projects in his district, and as a result, the district has come up short.
Trump admin plans to crack down on international students &amp; visitors who overstay their visas. Of the 45 million U.S. arrivals whose tourist or business visas expired in fiscal 2015, the agency estimates that about 416,500 people remained in the country. No respect for U.S. Law

International gangs based in Mexico "remain the greatest criminal drug  threat to the United States," and their most common method of smuggling  drugs is vehicles legally coming into the U.S., according to a 2017 Drug  Enforcement Administration report.

Nancy Pelosi—who called the higher compensation “crumbs”—continue to  push a narrative that these tax cuts won’t help businesses and  individuals.Let’s not forget that Pelosi herself praised an Obama-era bill that gave workers a $40 tax cut.
Tax cuts in 2018 were only one half of the benefits Americans are  receiving from Republican tax reform. The other half is that tax reform  is incentivizing businesses to grow and expand, hire more people and  raise workers’ wages.
Americans are beginning to learn about the lies. In February, after just  two months of implementing the tax cuts, the New York Times reported  that the new tax law had boomed in popularity, with the majority now  approving tax reform.

If employers offered decent wages and working conditions, they’d have  little trouble attracting American kids. Moreover, shutting Americans  out of the labor market has negative long-term consequences.
J-1 has no prevailing wage requirement, employers can pay the visa  holders lower wages than those U.S. workers earn in similar occupations . Employers are exempt  from paying the Social Security, Medicare, federal and state  unemployment taxes on J-1visa holders.
The State Department’s Summer Work Travel Program (SWT)  will once again, as it has for decades, provide an unlimited number of  J-1 visas to young foreign nationals who will come to the U.S. to work  at a variety of jobs.

The British government’s decisions to allow two critically ill babies to die in two years is a natural reflection of the culture of death and the steady increase in totalitarian tendencies among Western governments.

Americans should be asking what would happen if other countries picked up more of the cost of drug discovery.  This will be one of my top priorities if elected! https://t.co/IY4r83FqcA
Calculations suggest that the U.S. market accounts for as much as 78% of all global drug profits. These are the profits that drive innovation, and they are coming out of American wallets.
Humira, an arthritis and  colitis medicine that is the world’s top-selling drug, costs an  estimated $2,500 a month in the U.S. after discounts. In Germany, it is  about 30% less ($1,750) according to Bloomberg.
U.S. consumers spend roughly three times as much on prescription drugs  as consumers in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom.
While Americans shoulder that burden at pharmacy counters and in  insurance premiums and deductibles, Europeans get access to new  medications at deeply discounted prices.  UNFAIR TRADE!
Only 39% believe that their elected officials in Washington share their degree of concern.  Go check and see if your incumbent is voting for your values or the party. https://t.co/91ODlkjG5p

Congress needs a budget process that will produce  timely, responsible, and definitive budgets. More importantly the  process must actually reinforce the practice of governing, just as the  1974 Congressional Budget Act (CBA) intended.
We need a new budgeting process. We can no longer  afford to be buying votes with the lavish distribution of taxpayer money  and loading every bill with pork designed to grease the palms of other  members of Congress in a “you scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours”  paradigm.
Our nation’s total national debt currently stands at $20.5 trillion dollars,106% of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Congressional Budget Office (CBO) expects that twenty trillion figure to increase by 50% to thirty trillion within just ten years.

McCabe ordered an unauthorized leak to the Wall Street Journal in July of 2016, then "lacked candor" (i.e. lied) about it on at least four occasions, including under oath.  For this, he was fired, based on the recommendation of the Obama-appointed, nonpartisan Inspector General.
Mr. Pompeo has clearly demonstrated his understanding of the security threats facing our great country and the importance of national security and public safety!  Don’t allow Senate partisanship to block his nomination.
Discontented Californians are voting with their feet, and those feet are moving with a quickening pace.	WE MUST STAY AND FIGHT. VOTE FOR THE CANDIDATE NOT THE PARTY!
This system  has driven many Republicans off the election ballot, as the top two  slots are often won by Democrats.
In 2006, the state passed a new law requiring candidates to participate  in a single consolidated open primary, often called the “jungle  primary.” In these primaries, the top two vote-getters end up on the  election ballot, where they square off against each other.
A week after taking office, President Donald Trump issued an executive order 	prohibiting executive branch appointees from accepting gifts from registered 	lobbyists and lobbyist employers, lobbying their respective agency for five years.
"Is this Constitutional?” should actually be the first question asked, because the Constitution is the Supreme Law of the Land.

History has  shown us that preventing access to a firearm will not stop someone  intent on committing harm. Until we address the real underlying issues  of mental health, these types of atrocities will continue.
We, as a culture, must stop glorifying these criminals  and stop plastering their names and faces all over the media—giving them  national attention and making the act seem even more attractive to  other mentally ill, disaffected youth.

FY18 Fed appropriations package contains increased investments in mental health services and  supports. By including significant funding increases for these programs,  Congress has taken a crucial step to support individuals with mental  illness and their families.
Los Angeles Times, at least 59% of the 185 public mass shootings that took place in the United States from 1900 through 2017 were carried out by people who had either been diagnosed with a mental disorder or demonstrated signs of serious mental illness prior to the attack.
Last week, 70 new final regulations were published in the Federal Register, after 63 the previous week.That’s the equivalent of a new regulation every two hours and 24 minutes.
The Trump administration is on track to finish the first phase of its regulatory reform program with $645 million in net annual regulatory savings, according to an analysis by the American Action Forum.
The U.S. will overtake Russia to become the world's largest oil producer by 2023, according to the International Energy Agency, reflecting Trump administration policies such as approving major oil pipelines, opening up areas to drilling and regulation reform.
Don’t tell American steel and aluminum manufacturers they cannot meet demand.  Targeted tariffs along with smart deregulation will put Americans back to work.  Americans want to work!  Who would have believed the U.S. would be crowned “King of Oil” in the 70’s &amp; 80’s.

That case was quickly dropped, and he was eventually  released.   Immigration and Customs Enforcement was not notified prior  to his  release by the San Francisco Sherriff’s Department, as it had   requested.  Is this how we protect our citizens?
Kate’s accused murderer, was previously  deported 5 times and had 7 felony convictions.  After he  completed a prison sentence in March 2015, he was transferred to the San  Francisco Sherriff’s Department because of a 1995 warrant relating to a  marijuana charge.

Between 1945 and 1965, the decline in worker-to-beneficiary ratios went from 41 to 4 workers per beneficiary. Today there are just 2.9 workers per retiree.
Congress must not be permitted to divert Social Security funds for other uses. One key way to ensure that Social Security is solvent is to raise employment. New jobs, especially for young workers, will add to the Social Security tax base and address deficit reduction.
Social Security benefits are expected to be depleted by 2034. Thereafter, the program is projected to pay out 75% of benefits. There are roughly 10,000 baby boomers who turn 65 every day.
There are countless government programs that give foreigners easy access to American jobs. These programs replace U.S. citizens with cheap labor, reduce wages, and limit openings for new college graduates.
What role should government play in boosting the economy?	  The Government must not weaken or devalue our currency.  No country has ever devalued its way to prosperity.

Illegal immigrants who currently reside in the  U.S., have raised families, and have become an asset to our local  communities, I support a plan that would document and identify these  individuals and provide them with authorization to remain in the U.S.  under certain provisions
Protecting our nation's borders—land,  air, and sea—from the illegal entry of people, weapons, drugs, and  contraband is vital to our homeland security and economic prosperity.
Why should the U.S. consider renewing or granting  immigration protection for foreign visitors who broke the law by  overstaying their deadline?  They clearly have no respect for the law nor appreciation for being granted the right to work in the United States.
1 in 5 inmates in prison are foreign born, 95% are illegal.  Of the 45 million U.S. arrivals whose tourist or business visas expired in fiscal 2015, the agency estimates that about 416,500 people remained in the country.
According to the GAO, approximately 227,600 illegal aliens were incarcerated in state jails and prisons in FY 2009—a 40 percent and 25 percent increase, respectively, in criminal-alien incarcerations in state jails and prisons since FY 2003.
Los Alamitos Council members voted 4-1 to opt out of a state law that  prohibited state and local police agencies from informing federal  authorities in cases when illegal immigrants facing deportation are  released from detention.
