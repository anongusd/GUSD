@DNC People are benefitting across demographics regardless of race, sex or level of education. Unemployment rates are at or near record lows for African- Americans, Hispanics, Asians, women and people without high school diplomas.
@dnc There are currently more job openings than people unemployed, the first time that had happened since the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) In August, there were 7.1 million job openings - the highest number ever recorded - with only 6.2 million people unemployed.
@dnc The unemployment rate in September stood at 3.7 percent, the lowest rate since 1969. Not coincidentally, for the week ending Oct. 15, initial claims for unemployment benefits were the lowest since 1973, when the U.S. population was 110 million people smaller.
@dnc It was Hillary Clinton - not Donald Trump - who committed to continue the Obama's economic policies. Had Clinton become president, we would be experiencing the same anemic economic growth we experienced under the Obama administration.
@dnc The economy is now booming because President Trump took the opposite course. President Trump has dramatically cut both taxes and regulations - shrinking the government's size and power - while aggressively encouraging domestic energy production.
President Obama aka @dnc discouraged domestic energy production - for example, refusing to authorize the Keystone XL pipeline and openly attempting to bankrupt the coal industry.
President Obama aka @dnc expanded the federal government's size and power through dramatic increases in the number and scope of federal regulations.
President Obama aka @dnc raised taxes on businesses and individuals.
