This morning I helped launch Connecticut’s #2020Census efforts with @LGSusanB, @SOTSMerrill, @HPLCT, &amp; others! Having a complete and accurate census is vital to ensuring Connecticut receives its fair share of federal resources. https://t.co/CGHB4lvaEZ
Great seeing cadets from CT's Civil Air Patrol today. You all have bright futures ahead of you! https://t.co/cYwcPkHRpQ
In 2015, 9 innocent worshipers lost their lives at the Emanuel AME Church. Today, the House voted to close the loophole that enabled the shooter to purchase a firearm. #HR1112 #HonorWithAction https://t.co/tb4wDMEPYy
Congratulations to @KellyNPS, the new Superintendent of Coltsville National Historical Park &amp; Springfield Armory National Historic Site, who brings along a proven track record of building partnerships &amp; 30+ yrs of experience working within @NatlParkService. Welcome to Hartford! https://t.co/Hp4uXpQTOt
Proud to stand with the CT Delegation on this historic day. Congress has taken action and the House has passed Universal Background Checks. It’s time for the Senate to do the same. #HonorWithAction #EndGunViolence 📷: @jahimes https://t.co/n2wUfZjGmQ
It’s time we act to address these true emergencies, and for Congress to reassert its Constitutional authority over this executive overreach. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to do what is right and end this Emergency Declaration. https://t.co/Jz48pTKnvk
This is about Congress reasserting its Constitutional authority. We need border security &amp; comprehensive immigration reform, but it’s clear this is not a National Emergency. What is a National Emergency in our country is the gun violence epidemic, opioid epidemic &amp; climate change
ATTENTION: The Hartford and Torrington Social Security offices are closed for the time being due to a facilities issue. We will post when the offices are opened again.
Proud to join 225 of my colleagues in moving to block POTUS’s National Emergency. The real emergency is the gun violence epidemic that’s afflicting our country. https://t.co/GP2qHMb8uP

It is unconscionable that our air traffic controllers, TSA agents, border patrol, &amp; other dedicated employees are set to miss a 2nd paycheck. The House has voted 10 times to reopen the govt. I urge every Senator to support the CR that would reopen the govt and #EndTheShutdownNow
Today I again voted to reopen the Federal Government. Every day the government remains shuttered, the consequences become more severe and the burden placed on federal workers and contractors becomes heavier.
Social Security IS the nation's most effective anti-poverty program! Thank you to Nancy Altman and @SSWorks for highlighting how Social Security aligns with the vision of Dr. King. https://t.co/GcS7E0iJOI
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. told us that "Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men". Today, I join men and women across the nation in remembering Dr. King by recommitting ourselves to that effort for human progress.

It is outrageous that POTUS would consider diverting disaster relief for  Puerto Rico to pay for his border wall. This idea should be abandoned  immediately.    https://t.co/f7OtQFLQOD
The House will continue to take action to re-open these departments and fund Department of Agriculture. The Senate must take up this bill and #EndTheShutdownNow
The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau is closed, so breweries can’t introduce new beer. Bad for beer fans and bad for small businesses!
Hundreds of food inspectors have been furloughed, putting our food safety at risk.
Small farmers can’t get access to loans to buy supplies for 2019, potentially disrupting an entire year of planting.
The FDA is unable to review new prescription drugs, delaying potentially lifesaving treatment from getting to those who need them.
Today, the House of Representatives voted to re-open the Department of Agriculture (again). Below are some of the vital programs that are impacted by the shutdown. #Thread
This list is just an example of SOME of the pre-existing conditions people used to be denied health care for. The GOP is trying to overturn these critical protections. We can’t let that happen, that’s why Democrats are working to improve access to health care. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/Nre2PBh5Xi
Welcome and congratulations to our new Governor, @GovNedLamont and Lt. Governor @LGSusanB! All the best to you both, I’m excited to see what your administration will do!

Gun violence isn’t just mass shootings. Nearly 40,000 Americans died last year as a result of gun violence, some in our own backyard. I’m proud to join Democrats in introducing commonsense background check laws. #EndGunViolence #NeverAgain https://t.co/0DR4SQocH9
It’s time for Congressional Republicans and the President to join us in reopening the government now. Let’s have a debate about border security and about comprehensive immigration reform, but let’s do it with the government open instead of taking the America people hostage.
Last night, the President used fear tactics instead of facts, as @SpeakerPelosi said. The new House majority has already passed legislation that would end the shutdown.
The American people are already feeling the effects of the govt shutdown &amp; it will only get worse if it continues. Yesterday, I met an air traffic controller at Bradley Airport who is going w/o pay to keep the traveling public safe. Many of his colleagues have been furloughed.
It makes no sense to shutdown the government and not pay the very people in charge of protecting our borders. It’s time to reopen the government and pay our workers what they’ve earned.
It’s time to reopen government. The House passed legislation last week to do just that and fund Homeland Security, the IRS, the FAA and more. The House will act again this week. I won’t stop fighting until the government is reopened. #EndTheShutdown
Bryan works at Bradley Tower in Windsor Locks where 40 controllers are working hard without pay to keep the traveling public safe. That’s in addition to FAA aviation specialists who are furloughed. #ShutdownStories
It was a pleasure meeting Air Traffic Controllers Bryan Krampovitis and Kevin Coeyman, who are keeping our airways safe without a paycheck during the #Shutdown. https://t.co/4qbsNFDMS3

Today I voted to re-open the govt. From the beginning, workers have been political pawns. The House, led by Democrats has approved legislation that re-opens the govt. It’s time for this shutdown to end &amp; for us to get to work. https://t.co/wNM78j7HxF
I was also especially proud to support @SpeakerPelosi today. She is the first woman and first Italian-American to be Speaker of the House. She has been an strong leader on climate change, election reform, health care, and Social Security, and a dear friend for many years.
Today, the People’s House returned to the people. Over the past 2 yrs Americans have used their voices to stop the repeal of the ACA &amp; elect dozens of Democrats to the halls of Congress. We will restore regular order and bring on commonsense solutions to help the American people.
I'm honored to be sworn in again. Serving the people of #CT01 in Congress continues to be one of the greatest privileges of my life. I am also thrilled to welcome the newest member of the CT Delegation to Congress, Jahana Hayes, who is a true leader &amp; fighter for the people of CT https://t.co/aPCTSujyMy
1 yr ago the #GOPTaxBill became law. It was rushed thru Congress absent of regular order &amp; has had a huge impact on CT, where middle-class families are paying the burden by being double-taxed. In Jan. we’ll fight for real reform for hard-working American workers &amp; their families.
Read my full statement here: https://t.co/X0kfL4VTAb
Between Secretary Mattis resigning, the President pulling troops out of Syria and Afghanistan, and the stock market plunging, the President’s decision to have a government shutdown over a border wall is throwing our country into chaos. This is not the way to run our country.
Border security is imperative in our nation, however building a $5 billion wall is not the answer and not the security measures our country would need. This funding is a waste of American taxpayers’ hard-earned money.

Republican AGs &amp; the Trump Admin's refusal to defend the law has endangered the gains we've made in protecting people's care &amp; goes against the voices of the American people who spoke up when R's tried to repeal the ACA. Democrats will fight this &amp; strengthen patient protections.
Yesterday's reckless and cruel court decision is an attack on the 133 million Americans with pre-existing conditions and the millions more who have benefited from the ACA's consumer protections, premium subsidies, and Medicaid expansion.

Dr. Billington was a national treasure and this is a great loss to the country. Here are a few photos from when we worked together. He even came up to East Hartford for a visit! https://t.co/cqSqkUwPJX
He was the sage of the nation, the epitome of intellect, grace, and class. He was all that you would want in the Librarian of Congress, the gate keeper of truth and the cumulative knowledge of the nation’s heritage, culture, and literature.
I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Dr. James Billington last week. Dr. Billington was the 13th Librarian of Congress @librarycongress. Working with him was like working with a mixture of Gandolf and Dumbledore, because of his knowledge and wisdom.

155 years ago today, President Lincoln traveled to PA to honor those who died in the bloodiest battle of the Civil War. In only 272 words and in 2 minutes, he defined sacrifice, service and spoke to our better angels to unify the country once again.  #GettysburgAddress #155th https://t.co/TvUhsEUVtt
Social Security isn’t an entitlement - it’s the insurance we as Americans pay for over a lifetime of work. Here’s a  clip to when I confronted the Heritage Foundation on this issue. #TBT https://t.co/V3xtIOw6wU
With 10k Baby Boomers retiring a day, we must strengthen and expand Social Security for those who worked hard all their lives, or those with a severe disability.
Hartford is a city on the move! I applaud @TheHartford for making this generous investment in our children. https://t.co/VV1pHJ9s74
Millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions could face discrimination from insurance companies if the GOP’s lawsuit succeeds. The new Democratic House will protect health care for all Americans. #ProtectOurCare
My deepest sympathies go out to those who have lost loved ones in the CA wildfires. My support and prayers are also with the brave men and women battling these terrible fires.
Today, we pause and reflect on the service and courage of our veterans and their families who sacrificed so much to protect our freedoms and values here at home. We are the land of the free because of the brave. Thank you veterans.
I’m terribly saddened by the tragic news coming from Thousand Oaks, Calif. There are no more words for these atrocities in our country – only action. Congress must act to end rampant gun violence in America. I refuse to allow this to be normal.

For 2/3 of seniors, Social Security is 90% of their income and the last 1/3 completely rely on the program alone!		I took to the floor to ask my Republican colleagues where their courage was to do what is right for average Americans who rely on the insurance that they paid into! https://t.co/ySJZC2PU16
I call on my colleagues – regardless of party – do what is right. Reject calls to gut Social Security and Medicare – Do not devastate Social Security and Medicare at a time when our Baby Boomers will depend on them the most.
It is the insurance that working Americans have paid for and earned through a lifetime of work – and should be able to depend upon once they retire.
The trillions they are adding to the deficit are no accident: cutting Social Security and Medicare have always been the next step – what they call “entitlement reform”. 		⚡️NEWSFLASH!! ⚡️ 		These are NOT “entitlements”!
That is why I call on the House to support my motion: 		To ensure that nothing in this bill can take effect unless and until the Chief Actuaries have certified that this bill will not harm the Medicare and Social Security Trust Funds.
Now, I have criticized my Republican colleagues for not paying for their tax reform. Turns out I was mistaken – they will pay for it by forcing devastating cuts to programs like Social Security and Medicare.

This is a sad day for America. My deepest condolences to his wife Cindy, children, loved ones, and to fellow Americans who share this grief.
It was an example of valor that has been on display throughout his life, and underscored at that moment when it mattered most to do what was right! You didn’t have to agree with him to recognize his heroism love of country and unwavering adherence to doing the right thing.....
The McCain moment that is seared in the mind of so many Americans was during the 2008 Presidential race with everything on the line in the heat of battle, in the midst of the debate, when he pauses and corrects a woman’s racist stereotyping of Barack Obama.
@SenJohnMcCain was an iconic American hero, whose life of principle centered around leadership and was dedicated to service above self, to country, and the human condition over petty politics and personal gain.
They are picking winners and losers. The winners are the red states that the blue states have been subsidizing. The losers are the taxpayers in Manchester, West Hartford, and elsewhere in Connecticut. This is unacceptable.
It started with the extreme limits placed on the state and local tax deduction, which have existed in the tax code since the Civil War. The Treasury's actions continue to target states like CT that are trying to protect their residents from double-taxation.
Yesterday, the Treasury Dept. proposed new regulations that would target states like CT. The politicization of tax law in this partisan manner is unprecedented. The tax code is now being wielded as a weapon against CT for the benefit of red states and the GOP agenda.
I’m thinking of Sen. John McCain and his family during this time. I’m wishing him peace as he continues to battle cancer.

The American ppl deserve better from Congress. Americans deserve to see where their elected officials stand on each of the issues separately, &amp; deserve an up/down vote. I hope in the coming days we vote on CHIP &amp; DACA on their own, on their merits, &amp; take the politics out.
Republicans control the House, Senate, &amp; White House, yet they could not fulfill the most basic of function of governance – keeping the federal govt open.  We’ve gone from stopgap to stopgap w/o any meaningful attempt from Rs to work bipartisanly on a long term budget agreement.

Last night I shared my commonsense plan to ensure #SocialSecurity remains strong for years to come. Watch here: http://t.co/SPwKB5aeHl
#SocialSecurity is the one program the middle class can count on. SS has never missed a payment through good times and bad #2100Act
#SocialSecurity is affordable. With commonsense measures we can improve and preserve the system for the rest of the century @SenBlumenthal
There is nothing like #SocialSecurity available on the private market.  Guaranteed retirement, disability, and survivors coverage #2100Act
It's time that the COLA actually reflected the cost of living incurred by seniors #CPI-E #2100Act #SocialSecurity
2/3 rely on Social Security for most of their retirement income. Without SS 44% of seniors would live in poverty. Expand #SocialSecurity now
The#2100Act cuts taxes for seniors, improves benefits, and preserves the #SocialSecurity system through the end of the century
Social Security is not an entitlement, it is earned compensation. It's the insurance you've paid for. #2100Act http://t.co/G7JWYs41Ej
