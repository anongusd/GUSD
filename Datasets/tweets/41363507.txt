My sincere congratulations again to Jacky Rosen, my hat‚Äôs off to the hard work her team put into this race. The transition will be easy as our teams work together for the future of our great state.
You made calls, knocked doors, contributed to keep our ads on the air, and helped us fight the outrageous smears and attacks. Thank you for all you have done. YOU are the reason ours is the biggest and strongest ground game in Nevada history. Our victory will be because of you. https://t.co/Bd0Q86SHXz

"Rosen‚Äôs campaign did not respond to a call and email for comment."		Sounds about right considering Democrat Jacky Rosen raises more money from California than Nevada, dodges debates, and hides from voters beyond her campaign office. https://t.co/xB0ndCLW9a

There was a price when our nation‚Äôs founders framed the future with independence and freedom, and a cost when our veterans left their families to serve and protect our country -- But too often we forget that the fight for freedom continues with us.
It‚Äôs our turn to fight for those, that already fought for us. https://t.co/lZIt01vXhY
Freedom may not always require us to fight abroad, but it does always require us to advance the battle at home. 		In honor of #IndependenceDay tomorrow stand with me in the fight for our great state and nation: https://t.co/ayaJBzx11w https://t.co/A2jtH3OOVx
