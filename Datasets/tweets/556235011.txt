@ValeriJo30 @seankfranks @im_peach_mint @RTyler_24 @realDonaldTrump @E_Hopwood @jasonfein Just say what the Bills passed allow.
@ValeriJo30 @seankfranks @im_peach_mint @RTyler_24 @realDonaldTrump @E_Hopwood @jasonfein It’s not arguing ... its Facts. It’s a Fence as referred to in the Law. It’s not my fault that Bush2 signed the “Secure Fencing Act of 2006” and the the Appropriations bills specifically say that the prototypes of the Wall Commissioned by tRump are not allowed.
@seankfranks @im_peach_mint @RTyler_24 @ValeriJo30 @realDonaldTrump @E_Hopwood @jasonfein I have many times ... looked like a “fence” to me. It’s Bush/Obama “Fence”! It’s
@seankfranks @im_peach_mint @RTyler_24 @ValeriJo30 @realDonaldTrump @E_Hopwood @jasonfein Read the Republican backed “Laws”, it’s a “Fence”. First was the “Secure Fence Act of 2006” and no Wall under the prototypes tRump commissioned has been built and is not authorized to be built, even under the knew appropriations bill tRump is about to sign.
@seankfranks @im_peach_mint @RTyler_24 @ValeriJo30 @realDonaldTrump @E_Hopwood @jasonfein It’s a “Fence”

@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Funny, “State Propaganda Entertainment Network @FoxNews” reported that you were going through page by page at 9am this morning.
@hotweetakes @ScienceHoffman @RyanGirdusky According to CPB definition asylum seekers are included in “Total Apprehension/Inadmissible” (not my definition, CBP’s definition). Asylum seekers are included in “Inadmissible”. 		Apprehensions plus Inadmissible = Total
@hotweetakes @ScienceHoffman @RyanGirdusky That’s what the definition says on the statistics published by CBP. There’s no other information to use other than what CBP publishes monthly.
@hotweetakes @ScienceHoffman @RyanGirdusky Okay expert, what are the real number? If we can’t trust the numbers published by CBP then were would you suggest to pull the stastics from?
@hotweetakes @ScienceHoffman @RyanGirdusky Any only base on what CBP publishes monthly.
@hotweetakes @ScienceHoffman @RyanGirdusky If it’s not valid statistic, then why does CBP publish the statistics? They must think it’s valid or they are just gaslighting as you say. 		But according to CBP: Total Apprehensions = Apprehensions + individuals inadmissible + individuals seeking asylum + withdrawn apps
@TADirector1 @Hosanna71010988 @Truthse84516611 @senatemajldr @MickMulvaneyOMB And at $25,000 per mile ... private land owners will 0.8 of a mile 👍

@TADirector1 @Hosanna71010988 @Truthse84516611 @senatemajldr @MickMulvaneyOMB There is no TX legislation for this and the two TX lawmakers said to “design, test, construct, and install physical barriers, roads, and technology ..”
@senatemajldr This was a good Tweet till you get to the point “fully-functioning federal government”.
@hotweetakes @ScienceHoffman @RyanGirdusky And yet illegal apprehensions have been declining for decades (per CBP stats)
@hotweetakes @ScienceHoffman @RyanGirdusky I was quoting Fox News.

@realDonaldTrump You’ve had more than two years to “Make America Great Again” .... so essentially you’re still saying it’s “Not Great”?
@hotweetakes @ScienceHoffman @RyanGirdusky He did say technically he could but if he diverted funds from the Army Corps of Engineers or Coast Guard or money that’s desperately needed for flood protection in TX, CA, PR and other development - that there would be a heavy price to pay. 	Even ‘ole Mitch wouldn’t allow this.
@hotweetakes @ScienceHoffman @RyanGirdusky The Chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee is Nita Lowey. Yarmuth is Chairman of the Budget Committee.
@hotweetakes @ScienceHoffman @RyanGirdusky Nina Lowey did NOT say that.
@hotweetakes @ScienceHoffman @RyanGirdusky And the “fence” can only be constructed in the Rio Grande Valley Sector excluding the Low Rio Grande Wildlife Refuge between Brownsville, TX and the Gulf of Mexico.
@hotweetakes @ScienceHoffman @RyanGirdusky I call what it’s officially called in the Appropriations Bill - a Fence. The exact same as Presidents Bush and Obama constructed. The Bill specifically says that. It can’t be any of the 8 Wall prototypes commissioned by tRump. 		You can download the proposed bill and read it.
@realDonaldTrump Wait till he sees that the FBI is getting appropriated $653 million more than his budget request.

@Driveshard75 @adasomg @realDonaldTrump 654 miles of existing fencing from before tRump. No “Border Wall” has been built based on the 8 prototypes commissioned by tRump.
