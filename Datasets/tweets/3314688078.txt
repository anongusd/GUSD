@ChangeTheLAUSD @4LibertyRising @alllibertynews @Rossputin @justinamash @630khow @realDonaldTrump @POTUS The constitution was set up for the states to collect taxes and pay the fed govt. the states AND Congress held the purse strings. When they decided to do the mandatory fed tax during wwii, they made the ppl the fed resource for money. They view the ppl as their food now. We lose
@ChangeTheLAUSD @4LibertyRising @alllibertynews @Rossputin @justinamash @630khow @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Remove calif and he wins the popular vote and the electoral vote. That’s why an electoral college is needed. One state should not override the rest of the country.
@4LibertyRising @alllibertynews @Rossputin @justinamash @630khow @realDonaldTrump Don’t even get me started on the duty of congress giving mass authority to the nsa, dept of energy, epa, and the hither swarms of other agencies now able to create law and take our hard earned money.
@4LibertyRising @alllibertynews @Rossputin @justinamash @630khow @realDonaldTrump On that we agree. Amazing how they created the fed reserve and gave up that duty.
@4LibertyRising @alllibertynews @Rossputin @justinamash @630khow @realDonaldTrump As I did in the previous reply, it’s in the preamble. Congress does not have the authority to tell the executive branch how to do their job. They passed the laws and have a duty to fund enforcing them.
@4LibertyRising @alllibertynews @Rossputin @justinamash @630khow @realDonaldTrump And pls don’t tell me I’m falling for political propaganda. I live on the border. I’ve seen the impact. It’s not ppl who want to work hard or Who appreciate our country coming here. It’s not the 80’s.
@4LibertyRising @alllibertynews @Rossputin @justinamash @630khow @realDonaldTrump It’s in the preamble for all of fed govt. Congess has a duty to give the funding to uphold the laws they pass so the executive branch can do its duty. If this was wwii &amp; these were Germans coming in to harm our citizens, it would have been a no brainer. Gangs? Drugs? No brainer.
