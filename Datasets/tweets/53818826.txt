I quit my job of 10 years on October 1.  Now I am trying to understand what the Lord wants me to do with my life.  Presently, I am just working around the house and praying for guidance
Awake since 1:00 am.  Anyone wanna chat?
It's always nice getting a phone call from an old friend letting you know they still care.
As I drove to town today	I look down at my hands	I realize how much they have aged	I look in the mirror	And I see the grief	All of it has aged me	My hope is that we will not be long apart.
The nice thing about election day is that if you hang around the polls, you can meet Democrat friends who have been dead for years...

Clive and I are gonna keep at Mom's house tonight   she us worried about me.  Trying to make her feel better.  Will watch Cowboys football and try to sleep.

Prom Pictures.  I wish I could have taken her to a prom.  I wish I could have had even one dance with her.  I came along too late for the proms.  However, we often would play music and dance in the living room here at home.

Three months today   having a hard time.
I had planned on watching a good movie on Netflix tonight, but it is starting to look like bedtime is 9:00 pm.  Maybe 1:00 am will be better for the movie, after I wake up.  Lol
I sit here on a Saturday night reading my Bible.  I ask why, but that is not really the appropriate question.  The pertinent question is Who?  He makes the decisions, and I still worship, because He knows the end fom the beginning.  I will always praise His Name.

I always look forward to getting home on Friday night.  Now, it's really not any different from any other day of the week.  In fact, it seems to be more depressing because I have no plans and no one to take care of.
Clive is grumpy because I went to bed and then got back up again.  He will be mad all day tomorrow.  LOL
Clive wakes me up just before midnight, barking at deer outside the bedroom window.  A 70 lb dog standing on your chest and barking tends to make you very wide awake.  Watching NCIS to see if I can get sleepy again.
I am overwhelmed by the 16 years and 6 days we had from our first date until her death.  It still doesn't seem like enough but I do thank the Lord for our time together.  He knows what's best.

Finished my first day back at work.  It went well and everyone was wonderful.  However, it may be the longest 8 hours I have ever had to endure.  The hour drive home is filled with nothing but dread, because she is not here to come home to.
Am I ready for work tomorrow?  Am I ready for life tomorrow?  I just hope for routine, and not a lot of sympathy.  Just let it be normal.  Don't want to break down in uniform.  That's never appropriate.  LOL
I was never lonely before her.  	I was never lonely with her.	Why am I lonely now?	Because she became half of me.	Now I am a half seeking the whole.	The whole can only be found in Jesus.

The last few weeks of grief have me apparently attempting to perfect the catnap.  One thing for sure, my cat is starting to get tired.
I am looking forward to starting back to work on Monday.  However, I think it's going to be a very long weekend.
Went to take care of some estate paperwork today and dropped by my workplace as well.  All i can say that hour drive back home really sucks when i know she isn't here to meet me.

I just don't sleep.  I don't think this is good.  My dog doesn't think this is good.  He sleeps at my feet but gets grouchy at my constant trips to get a glass of water or go pee.  Sorry big guy...
The problem with grieving is that it's hard to see anyone's pain but your own.  It is selfish and there is a need for that at first.  However, you must move beyond the grief to have compassion for others in need.  Otherwise, it becomes a narcissistic exercise in self-indulgence

On Sunday, May the 20th, I resigned my job.  It was on Monday that she met me in the dining room with a hug and said, "I am so glad you're home with me now.  It's time."  She would die the following Saturday.  We had a wonderful week together.
So, I have spend the last two hours watching aovie on SyFy where the people all decided to take a swim off the yacht without putting down the ladder.  No sharks or monsters are eating them - just the attrition of treading water.  This is why I like to read rather than watch TV.
I spent less than a third of my life with you, but it was almost all of my happiness.
