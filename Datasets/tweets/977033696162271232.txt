This is bad as it relates to campaign financing, public corruption, healthcare fraud, and quality of care.
@streetnoodle @ninaandtito @CherokeeNative3 I fix my dinner. Your argument is tainted by personal experience and generalizations.
@streetnoodle @ninaandtito @CherokeeNative3 If you're going to hold us accountable for not preventing crime committed by men, then your mind is closed. We're done regardless, with all due respect.
@streetnoodle @ninaandtito @CherokeeNative3 This isn't about men. It's about bad people, which is largely men. 		You're indicating good men have leverage to change bad men. We pursue fraudsters in our free time - agnostic of gender. We believe in female empowerment but can't make impact under the current administration.

@XSIM_Adapter @brucefenton 3/ Importantly, by carelessly packaging, you're creating a blind rat race of an investment in which risk is out the window, unaccounted for, along with any investors' exposures. Those who 'innovated' them knew that. If Goldman's CEO is going to dip his finger into Cryptos,
@XSIM_Adapter @brucefenton 2/ Cryptos, when you account for herding behavior, are not comparable to other frauds that have led to financial crisis. MBOs allegedly (at the time) made packaged garbage into an investment of 'less risk', diversified, according to the shitholes who marketed them.
@XSIM_Adapter @brucefenton 1/ That cryptos are intrinsically worthless to begin with lends to the argument that an ICO can be legitimate and investors can simply lose their money.

@HaalandStig @Nouriel /1 	@HaalandStig , it appears you've overlooked the economics of the situation. What is objectively clear is that by getting personal as you just did is not going to lend credibility to BTC or any of the garbage that followed and continues.

@Rugginhoo @Nouriel /2 It's not accepted anywhere I've seen. As a storage of value, it's worth nothing intrinsically though, from a market perspective, is very volatile and thus a risky and unreliable storage of value (so don't make the market value argument in evaluation).
@Rugginhoo @Nouriel /1 You spelled 'which' wrong.		I'm not sure whether you truly believe what you're saying but Bitcoin is not only the largest pump and dump of humanity, but also premised on bullshit. 		It's not at all used as a means of pmt (excluding criminal transactions),

@blacq2 @silewconsulting This article really puts the cherry on the cake, as we see related transactions over the long-term highlight policy decision-making not inspired but literally driven by greed and in violation, for example, of the STOCK Act.		https://t.co/25i64NJdJH
@blacq2 @silewconsulting 8. Oh, and last thing, moving forward, Hudson should consider revising former nonetheless existing procedures by which Hudson's IPO's prospectus went undisclosed unless public pool shareholders literally mailed a request to the Board. Smells.
@blacq2 @silewconsulting 7. The purpose of an IPO and a Board is not to control public shareholders absolutely but to represent them. The very mandate of the board is to establish sound and proportional control, which doesn't entail taking advantage of the PUBLIC POOL of investors. @SEC_Enforcement
@blacq2 @silewconsulting 6. Who owns the Class B shares? A company cannot have both minority interest holders while 'wholly owning' a subsidiary. What kind of bylaws allow a Company to misrepresent the value of Class A shares, allowing Class B shareholders effectively absolute corporate control!
@blacq2 @silewconsulting 5. Class B shares have ten times the number of votes as do the Class A shares; while the two classes may be equal in market value on a share to share basis, why is it that @DufryUSA only offered the public with shares amounting to 1/10 of the control of all other shares?
@blacq2 @silewconsulting 4. Despite @DufryUSA's and Hudson's duty to make decisions as a fiduciary on behalf of public shareholders, @dutyfreedufry, instead, only offered Class A shares in Hudson's IPO with Class B shares remaining with existing 'shareholders'.
@blacq2 @silewconsulting 3. that Hudson was a wholly owned subsidiary (i.e., completely owned) of Dufry. So, who is Dufry hiding by misrepresenting their ownership of the formerly private Hudson Group? Let's take a look at share structure.
@blacq2 @silewconsulting 2. The Hudson Group, which recently and very questionably sold shares in the primary markets, "will mainly impact Dufry's minorities interest line" - Dufry being the parent company. That doesn't make any sense in the context of former statements made by Dufry
@blacq2 @silewconsulting Not that it's relevant at all but former Mcdonald's CEO Jim Skinner is now (very quietly) on the Board of Hudson Group Ltd, which is owned by Swiss-based Dufry AG. Haven't looked into Hudson enough but Dufry has some questionable corporate governance practices.

@killamikemilla @CNBC With all due respect, I don't trust new developers or the developers who wrote the initial code. Bitcoin contributes absolutely nothing to society relative to sovereign currencies (unless we make an argument that it's valuable in places such as Cuba
@killamikemilla @CNBC What you're implying is that financial freedom inspires opportunities for corruption or at least allows open source contributions. In theory, there is no 'elite' governing US dollars; intention is to back the currency, instill trust in the public.
@killamikemilla @CNBC Blockchain is brilliant. BTC is just the largest pump and dump in history.
@killamikemilla @CNBC I wholly disagree. The @federalreserve does their best, which isn't to say that a bad apple can't ruin a barrell. Personally, I'm happy with dollars, and prefer them to lugging gold around in my pocket.
@killamikemilla @CNBC I'm not saying that our system is perfect. But it's backed by the full faith and credit of the gov't whereas Bitcoin is backed by a mythical person or @officialmcafee allegedly eating his own glans.

@killamikemilla @CNBC I've mined and bought, and in all honesty, know a lot more than you do. Have fun in the tulipmania (while it lasts). The small guys are those who will ultimately face the financial despair.
@killamikemilla @CNBC If you're going to argue that the divisibility of BTC makes it valuable, it doesn't. Look at the penny.
@killamikemilla @CNBC Divisibility doesn't add value. Blockchain, on the other hand, can be valuable as a ledger, similar to an accounting ledger. As it applies to Bitcoin doesn't highlight the value of Blockchain, which has a 'back door' of sorts.
@ProgressOutlook Those profits will go far in prison.
@killamikemilla @CNBC Until then, I'm content entrusting the US gov't with backing the dollar (since the gold standard doesn't exist anymore). Regardless, digital US dollars or other sovereign currencies trump Bitcoin as an efficient and reliable storage or value.
@killamikemilla @CNBC BTC is not the most portable. It takes days to clear a transaction through the 'unregulated brokers' with no framework for compliance. BTC is not scarce unless we assume it's backed by the full faith of a trustworthy source. We'd have to know who Satoshi is and confide in her/him
@killamikemilla @CNBC 3. If you compare Coinbase to a bank, which institution is more trustworthy? The bank - not because 'good people' work at banks but because regulators police conflicts of interest and bad behavior. In context, we can compare the crypto markets to the Wild West.
@killamikemilla @CNBC 2. Bitcoin is laughably less efficient than dollars, which are as 'digital' as Bitcoin. 	3. Bitcoin is dangerously susceptible to fraud:	A. Fraud via hacking (Satoshi &amp; Co. has info. we don't).	B. Residual fraud wrought by the lack of standards in the industry.
@killamikemilla @CNBC Bitcoin is not scarce if one can mine it. Such indicates it's not limited in supply. While first movers may argue that there is a limit, we are then putting our absolute trust and faith in the claims of an undisclosed 'Satoshi'.
