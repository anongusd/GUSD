Everyone follow @ConservPothead as I will be branching that towards #marijuana legalization and will continue to use this as a support for @realDonaldTrump .
Everyday more and more people are wrongfully be incarcerated for #marijuana . It’s time to #legalize and end ruining people’s lives for a something they decide to use. It’s time to #regulate it just like #alcohol and #cigarettes. 66% of numerous party members agree. #freetheweed
And if he doesn’t sign or if the senate doesn’t vote for it then you did what you could and the American people wouldn’t blame the house in this instance. Just make a deal and end the #shutdown
*give him the money he needs
@SpeakerPelosi  Its simple. @realDonaldTrump loves to make deals. Then make a deal. Put a extremely progressive stance (Marijuana legalization, free health care, free education) and give him the money for he needs.  It will benefit all Americans! And if he doesn’t sign then.....

@GovernorVA Just legalize and tax it. Consumers will consume. Farmers can farm. Business will gro!!!
@GovernorVA #legalization needs to happen. You can do it!!
@GovernorVA I am proud to see Virginia look at the benefits of #legalization of #Marijuana and bring the endless possibilities of jobs for the state. Let’s be the first to legalize in the south east and make the Virginia economy the best it’s ever been.
If you haven’t heard it today. We love you @realDonaldTrump and appreciate everything you are doing to keep us safe.

I got a crazy idea.. in this new #HouseofRepresentatives they should #legalize #marijuana and give the #5Billion for #TheWall that way everyone can agree on a new spending bill and it’s a win win for 66% of Americans that want legalization. @NORML @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi

https://t.co/YCKmYbbq7O @realDonaldTrump #America should be leading the way when it comes to #legalizedMarijuana and not other countries! Legalization needs to happen so we can shape the world on #marijuana , plus we are loosing on all that money that it can bring in.

in 2019 and awaking happens in such that others see the potential on marijuana and not just for getting “high”. 		The truth is that it would be another era of financial gains and not only for the “growers and cultivation”. No one includes the plastic makers, labelers, marketing
shadows. Even though a outstanding 66% percent of Americans want marijuana legalized in some capacity. 		I understand that big pharmacy and other ententes have have and are putting up blockades in hopes of slowing down the eventual #legalization  of marijuana. 		I am hoping that
It’s sad that marijuana became illegal due to “corporate thinking” and then a way to incarcerate “blacks, hippies, or thinkers in general”.  Yet, it’s 2018 and we are cool with almost everything that “politically correct” Americans allow us to be except marijuana is still in the
@realDonaldTrump this is key! This would help with the #opioidhysteria being created by #BigPharma . #BigPharma doesn’t respect you and continue to raise prices. Smack them with #legalization and show them we want to go natural! https://t.co/8xxjCl8hmJ
@realDonaldTrump that’s a huuuuggggeeee percent https://t.co/hq3zJmb2xE
@NORML @NORML you need to push your campaign. You need to do something everyone is going to talk about. Something to have the internet trending your name to get the recognition you deserve. It’s time to talk about #marijuana on the main stream!
@GovParsonMO https://t.co/7sOwChOrfF the rest of #Missouri should follow!

@DiamondandSilk I agree with prison reform. First thing that needs to happen is making #marijuana legal and focusing on real drugs (meth,heroin,crack, etc) and real crimes (rape, murder, etc).Statistics show more people are sent to prison for marijuana then anything else. Time for that to change

@DiamondandSilk Dead people neither!
It’s time for #congress to come together and #legalize #Marijuana . There’s too much #money to be made in taxes that are being ignored! Everyone wins with the end of prohibition! @realDonaldTrump use your clout to push reform!!
@realDonaldTrump I believe in your decision. All we the people want is someone who respects the future of marijuana and the profits associated with them!
@GovParsonMO A great way that studies have shown to lessen the opioid epidemic is to legalize marijuana. All legal states have significantly lower opioid issues.
@GovParsonMO @Biz417 Great job Governor!
@realDonaldTrump if we #legalize #marijuana nationally then we can tax it to help our #Military #roads #schools #Homeless and many other programs! You can tax the #hell out of it and people will still buy! It’s a win win
https://t.co/oZLQmOG6bE it’s legal to carry in DC , but not in the rest of the country? Kinda biased don’t you think @realDonaldTrump ? #legalize nationally and end this prohibition!
@FoxNews @CNN @CNNPolitics @MSNBC @CBSNews needs to do more stories on #legalization of #marijuana ! #Canada and now #Mexico are on board! We have 10 states now legal! This is overwhelming support for it to be legal! You guys can turn the tide by getting it in public eye!
@GovParsonMO https://t.co/crB1csNN7p  Illinois is getting ahead of the game. Look at the taxes the #legal states are bringing in! I believe this would be great for #Missouri . You have the power and support to get us legalized before them!

@GovParsonMO @MoGov Illinois is set to #legalizing #marijuana and you have the chance to do so before them.... it’s happening regardless so why not make that money first from taxes!!!!
@NORML overwhelming majority of people who want it legalized I surprised we haven’t had a major rally in D.C and not just in April. I’m talking about people from all walks of life showing Congress the support legalizing has. If we have a march with enough people they will listen!
Can everyone get over the @realDonaldTrump and #Russia bull!! @realDonaldTrump is doing great in our country and is focusing on bigger and better things! Focus all that energy on #legalization and bring even more jobs to our country! Stop the #WitchHunt and #KeepAmericaGreat
I’m loving all these events that are taking place. #marijuanalegization is around the corner. Thank you @realDonaldTrump
Thank you @realDonaldTrump for getting rid of Jeff Sessions... this is a new chapter for America and I believe a positive future for #marijuanainvestment

@HawleyMO Congratulations senator. Now get ahead of the ball and get #Missouri to be the first mod west state to #legalization and let’s make a bunch of money off of the taxes from it! No matter what legalizing is coming.. why not be one of the first before it becomes a nation wide thing.
ALL DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS NEED TO GET TOGETHER AND START A GREEN WAVE!!! #LegalizeMarijuana movement it’s time!!!!
Hey @realDonaldTrump I bet you can use the tax money from #LegalizeMarijuana to #BuildTheWall !
@realDonaldTrump 33 states now have legalized medical marijuana...what are we waiting for to legalize nationally!
Congratulations @HawleyMO . Missourians made an excellent choice. Now it’s time to take the vote of the people and legalize marijuana for recreational purposes. You have the support and be the first state in the Midwest to do so! Tax and regulate like alcohol! Big business!
@realDonaldTrump now that @Michigan has #LegalizeMarijuana and has become the 10th state to do so , now it is time to legalize nation wide!
Can we #LegalizeMarijuana now
@realDonaldTrump Now that Michigan looks like they are legalizing and Missouri just approved medical. Now it’s time to legalize nation wide!!!

#legalize #marijuana and I promise no one will complain. There’s too much money to make off of taxes and it can be easily regulated. Also will stop major funding to cartels out of #Mexico. @realDonaldTrump both parties will agree that legalization is the way to go.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @tommy4trump @realDonaldTrump I agree 100% . Let’s get the ball rolling on #marijuana business and we will be creating countless amount of jobs and billions in new taxes!!

@realDonaldTrump  this has to change!!! #Canada and #Mexico are getting ahead of us. https://t.co/aBDTQx1lGc
@NORML Our time is now. #canada and #Mexico are already ahead of the curb.
@FoxNews the issues I’m more concerned with is the lack of seriousness that is coming from the #GOP when it comes to #legalization of #marijuana. #Canada and #Mexico are getting ahead of us. We are missing out on a ton of new business and taxable product that would be our country
#ND be one of the first to #legalize and make a ton of money from it. Don’t believe in the #FakeNews associated with #marijuana . Legalization is coming and you have a chance to be one of the first to set the rules you see fit. #vote yes to legalize!
@NorthDakota be smart and #legalize to make that #money!! Tax and regulate like #alcohol !!
@HawleyMO last chance to put out an endorsement for which #marijuana bill you will be voting for...this will decide if I vote for you or @clairecmc . I’m a conservative in and out , but freedom of choice is important to me and so is how I decide I want to be medically treated!
@realDonaldTrump rumor has it you will be calling for #legalization after the elections on the #6th . Can we count on you to give the people what they want? Freedom of choice when it comes to #marijuana ?
@realDonaldTrump let’s lead the way of #marijuana #reform here in North America before #Canada and #mexico lead the way.. we should be first in this Nd making that sweet income from it...
@realDonaldTrump Imagine how many more jobs you’d create by legalizing #marijuana.
@realDonaldTrump
What if we turn every Canadian at tbe border who wants to do business here? We lose money..we can be making money from all ends by ending the war on marijuana.  https://t.co/5SrgGoc1MN
@realDonaldTrump don’t make America last to legalization. https://t.co/Lk8Qctxvep
The amount of #marijuana sold in #Canada just makes think of the possibility of it happening here @realDonaldTrump . They are running out of product already! The demand is high and these #Republicans need to get on board! Money to be made!!!!
It’s funny how many people are defending @HillaryClinton for the “joke” she made. Yet, if @realDonaldTrump would of made the same “joke” then everyone would be screaming #racism at him. The difference is ridiculous. SMH
I hear the phrase #FakeNews all the time. How about we end the #fakenews that is associated with #marijuana . 2/3 of the country agree we should legalize . Why is it so hard for #congress to listen to what the people want.
I’m a #Republican fighting to #legalize #marijuana. I love our #president and I love our #country. We are a country built on #business and I love the #money that could be made from it. Change our legal system and change a huge #deficit we have by ending the war on marijuana.
@NORML if you’d take the steps to have a rally in #WashingtonDC with no less then a million people. I guarantee they would #legalize. Fund the event, charter busses, get everyone involved and let’s march to get our voice heard. Our time is here and a huge event is all we need.
I 100% believe if every #Republican running for office decided that they would take steps in the #legalization of #marijuana that they would get the #Vote they need to win.
@realDonaldTrump it’s about business not just getting high. America could benefit tremendously from this. Look what happen when prohibition ended with alcohol. Billions are being wasted from taxes for locking people up when we could be making billions in taxes from #marijuana https://t.co/W3SLdR8DyN
@realDonaldTrump a true fact is that crime is down in states that have #legalized #marijuana . Couldn’t hurt if the whole country was the same way.
@realDonaldTrump  “By 2020 the legal cannabis market will create more than a quarter of a million jobs. This is more than the expected jobs from manufacturing, utilities or even government jobs.”		- @Forbes
Even former president #Clinton gives @realDonaldTrump a thumbs up! https://t.co/8g2hv0IN55

@realDonaldTrump End the drug war and unfairness involved in targeting the black community. #legalization needs to happen and real crimes would be solved...best part is the wasted money used for incarceration could be used in other areas. Save tax payers money and tax the hell lut of #marijuana

@realDonaldTrump delivers remarks and signs legislation aimed at fighting opioid addiction. Legalizing marijuana will also fight opioid addiction and been proven no deaths related!!!
If #Republicans want to win on November 6th then start making preparations of #legalization of #marijuana and watch the votes pour in!
#VoteRed2018 #LegalizationInAmerica #legalizeMarijuana keep making America great by legalizing marijuana @realDonaldTrump . Give the states the power to do so. The financial gain is too huuugggeee to ignore. We the people should have a choice on what we consume.
@HawleyMO the people of #Missouri would like to hear your take on #legalization of #marijuana?
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/x84fKYmhxA this is unacceptable. Things like this need to change.
#senators and #governers of respected red states. It’s time to #legalize #marijuana and receive the huuuuuuggggeee financial income from it as #Canada is doing. Keep making #America great by taxing and controlled as alcohol once was. Together we can make it a reality!!!
@realDonaldTrump Canada is winning in the financial aspect of the marijuana money.. we have to legalize here with our own business model so we can be better then them on it. Keep making America great by winning in all fields! Let’s boost all business by legalizing the herb.
It has been proven over and over again that marijuana helps and isn’t a killer. Help change the views on this to #congress and help us win getting the plant legal!!
Left is*
I am a conservative. I vote red. I also am a big supporter of #LegalizeIt #marijuana and upset on the amount of taxes we are losing out on by not making it legal across the #UnitedStates . @realDonaldTrump needs to get the ball rolling and make our economy even greater!!

@HawleyMO @clairecmc Yet no answer on thoughts of becoming the first state in the mid west on legalizing marijuana? 60-70% of Missourians are forvit and it would bring a huge amount of jobs for all Industry’s.
@GovParsonMO @AIMTWEET13 Legalization of Marijuana will bring in a ton of new business and jobs. Be first in full legalization before Illinois and set an example of how it should be done. Age and taxes same as liquor. Boost in revenue for everyone involved.
@HawleyMO @clairecmc what are the views you have on legalizing of marijuana?
@GovParsonMO why not take a risk and work on legalizing #marijuana here in #Missouri and bringing a whole new slew of business that will create a ton of new jobs. Also including all the construction it will bring in for the unions!
