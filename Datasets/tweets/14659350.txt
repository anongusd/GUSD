The longer the shutdown goes, the more likely it is that regulators either don‚Äôt finish projects in this administration or they aren‚Äôt able to fight the legal fights while still in charge (assuming Trump loses in 2020)
And think about the process for new reg projects ‚Äî proposed rule, comment period, assess comments, final rule, and potentially fending off legal challenges? Not a quick process and most of the time you wouldn‚Äôt want to give up a couple months where nothing moves forward.
@JBSDC It‚Äôs almost as if a government shutdown is less than ideal!
Whenever the government does re-open, there‚Äôs likely going to be a glut of unfinished regs for the Federal Register to process. And that takes time. And rules don‚Äôt officially exist until they‚Äôre published in the FR.
@JBSDC Hence the ‚Äúrelatively.‚Äù You‚Äôre correct, those shops can‚Äôt even engage in policy making while awaiting the reopened government.
#finreg is relatively unscathed by the shutdown ‚Äî the banking regulators are self-funded and still humming. The catch? The Federal Register IS shut down, making it impossible to move forward with new rules that must be published there.

Lost in all the Trump-Fed drama -- does anyone have the slightest idea who he would rather have in that seat?		Certainly not anyone he actually considered for the role.
@FinGregg For as market-sensitive as this administration is, the statement was pretty surprising.		And yea, there may come a point where things are really ugly and the Treasury Secretary needs to be able to go on TV and say, "We are on top of the issue" and have people believe it.
For reference, Mnuchin's statement yesterday said the call was to "discuss coordination efforts to assure normal market operations." https://t.co/C2V92W9eaS
@FinGregg I've had this concern raised to me today. Even if the statement comes and goes with minimal market harm, there's a question of whether the market has reduced its confidence in the Treasury going forward.
Liesman: "Yea, I'm not sure what is cleared up here."		Reads out the Treasury statement, correctly notes Mnuchin is the one who brought up liquidity (when no one was talking about liquidity).
Senior Treasury official says Mnuchin talked about liquidity and his definite lack of concern due to "full transparency."		Says real headline should have been about the economy. 		Treasury Secretary, unprompted, talking about liquidity and credit is always gonna be the headline.
Senior Treasury official continued: "No reason to believe it was about anything related to lending or liquidity as far as any concerns out there."		Of course, Mnuchin statement specifically talks about "ample liquidity," so Treasury is the one who injected the notion out there.

The House has had tricky votes in the past, but convincing members of Congress who already know they've lost their jobs to come back days before Christmas to vote for a bill they don't like very much to accomplish the bare minimum of policymaking seems particularly tricky.

@bcheungz @reporterev Nice story!
@reporterev @bjrich_ @SylvanLane there's "exclusive" stories and then there are "EXCLUSIVE" stories
@reporterev @bjrich_ @SylvanLane I have a bank account. By that logic, couldn't I make the same case?
@reporterev Perhaps. Another aspect here: the Volcker Rule doesn't engender the same mobilization of conservative causes as the CFPB.		But you're probably right that someone is gonna try to make hay here.
@bjrich_ Bears watching, but for now I'm skeptical. Such a dramatic (and some might argue unreasonable) interpretation of the law doesn't seem to mesh with how the top Volcker regulators have operated thus far.		More a Mulvaney approach than a Quarles one, imo.
@reporterev The outside group factor you noted is significant (the Big Spring lawsuit by all appearances was a CEI lawsuit with a bank as the vehicle of entry), but I wonder if there's a $25B bank willing to take on such a fight.
@reporterev my question is what bank(s) are in the space where:		1. They aren't exempted from Volcker under Crapo as is	2. Face Volcker compliance costs that make this gambit worthwhile	3. Are predisposed to take on what could be a nasty and protracted fight
If you're a bank, are you willing to go scorched earth with regulators and Congress for:		1. A line of business that isn't a major aspect of your operations	2. Something that you probably have already built up to comply with	3. A fight that you are far from guaranteed to win

@robblackwellAB @SylvanLane True, but one could make the argument that it's become clear that you can lean hard on a particular institution who grabs headlines to gain leeway to be far less aggressive across a whole range of supervisory matters....
@robblackwellAB @RicardoAQuinto @SylvanLane The bar is just going to be so high. Short of someone hucking a copy of the Federal Register at her from the dais it's not going to live up to expectations.
@robblackwellAB @SylvanLane Harder to prove a negative. You'd need to have a bank really, really screw up in a spectacularly public way and somehow be able to show the CFPB is definitely not doing anything on it.		Mulvaney was there to break the glass. Kraninger is there to bring in a new pane.
@robblackwellAB @RicardoAQuinto @SylvanLane Called shot: It actually will be boring.
@robblackwellAB @SylvanLane Probably right. Coming in after Mulvaney, who relished the fight, is likely going to give her a leg up. If she leans hard on the "I'm just a bureaucrat" it could be had to gather up the pitchforks.		But you can bet Dems will try.
@SylvanLane True, but my hunch is that Dems are more willing to dive into a protracted legal fight over the direction of the CFPB than Republicans are.

It's kind of mind-boggling how bad 1987's Black Monday was. The Dow would have to drop over 5600 points in today's market to see the same percentage decline.  Over 22 percent!
@ChesapeakeMatt But it's not more volatile historically.		Not a single day in the market under Trump is a Top-20 mover of percentages in the Dow, in gains or losses.
Today's Dow decline was bigger, in terms of points, than the infamous market crash after the first failed TARP vote in the House - h/t @SylvanLane		That's why using just points to describe market swings isn't incredibly helpful.
@SylvanLane Hah, we cleared that today!
Bingo. The Dow going up 938 points in 2008 (when it was worth just 9300 points) is a completely different universe than when it went up 670 points in 2018 (Dow at 24K at that point).		Those are top Dow gainer days #1 and #3 of all-time, respectively. https://t.co/mKwWvZ1LF6

Quarles's mantra since joining the Fed has been that you can simplify rules without actually deregulating/increasing risks.		That thesis will be repeatedly challenged by the Democratic majority in the coming months.
Waters, citing Fed data on outstanding supervisory issues, asks Quarles if "megabanks are too large to manage."
Quarles: Our tailoring proposal reduces compliance burden without increase risk.		Waters: So why did Brainard oppose it?		Quarles: We heard her concerns and had a robust process.
Quarles, pressed by Hensarling, says regulators could agree to make Fed the lead Volcker regulator without action from Congress.		Of course, getting regulators to willingly give up jurisdiction is always an uphill climb....
Quarles: "We will continue to get more transparent with each iteration of the stress tests."
First question to Quarles from Hensarling: Why the heck haven't you gotten rid of the qualitative part of the stress tests yet?		Quarles: We're working on it.

Also contends that banks are increasingly able to reverse engineer the Fed's models with every round of stress testing. So opacity not a cure-all.
Argues banks have strong internal motivations to keep their books sound beyond simply pleasing their Fed masters.
Hm. Quarles says he always has been "a little skeptical" of the notion that giving banks insight into stress testing process would allow them to "game" the results.

For her part, Waters is downplaying the fire-breathing role in the run-up. In statement emphasized her "open door" policy to all parties on committee work.
To me, one of the big questions for the banking agenda is the broader political dynamics. Maxine Waters is already becoming a top target of Trump's (and vice versa), so is it possible to get work done as they hurl insults/subpoenas?

Food for thought.		Brainard voted FOR the Fed's Volcker Rule rewrite. Seems set to vote AGAINST its Crapo bill/big bank reg easing.		Could give folks a sense of where the needle really is moving on bank regulation.
- Banks in the 100B-250B club will soon enjoy a two-year stress testing cycle and "tailored" liquidity requirements	- Fed open to stricter rules on riskier firms. Lots of cross-jurisdictional activity, nonbank investmenting, or short-term wholesale funding? The cuffs tighten.
Some initial takeaways from the Fed proposal:		- super-regionals left out in the Crapo bill get some relief, most notably in reduced LCR and less frequent DFAST	- BUT they're not getting relief from the countercyclical buffer or qualititative CCAR	- GSIBs remain GSIBs

@AlanZibel @ryanjtracy For good reason -- it's a very big deal with big implications! I'm just wondering if we ever reach a point where we get something more meaningful than him using every interview opportunity to slam an institution he more or less can't touch.
@AlanZibel @ryanjtracy But is the storyline really advancing? I take Ryan's point that he wasn't asked specifically by WSJ about the Fed and he offered it up himself, but it seems like we're just getting breathless over him saying fundamentally the same thing with different words.
Hey what‚Äôs to be gained by repeatedly giving Trump opportunities to slam the Fed? Is the needle really moving here in any meaningful way?

@TylerGellasch A fair point. And I'm actually very open to the notion that the salaries of legislative/executive branch employees should be much higher to offset the dynamic you lay out.		But these folks aren't charity cases.
@EvanSparks I get the dynamic at play. High-ranking government jobs are hugely powerful and prestigious and the compensation is, arguably, not commensurate with that.		But you frequently hear people talk about post-public service careers of politicians as if they were on the dole.
"Clearly this member of Congress simply has to go join a corporate board after the sludge mines of a $174,000 annual salary."
"Politician needs to go make money after exiting public service" is such a bizarre take when you think about the fact that they all make six figures.		I get the notion they COULD make significantly more elsewhere, but they're not poor.

OCC Chief Otting told lawmakers today he is "not comfortable" with where Wells Fargo is in terms of paying back wronged auto loan customers.		@PatrickMRucker was the man to unearth Wells's woes on this front last month: https://t.co/kcZCg1F5T7
That's a wrap for regulators at Senate Banking. Big takeaways:		- Republicans want Quarles to step on the gas.	- Quarles is intently focused on getting the $100B-250B chunk of rules out by end of the year.	- Otting still not happy with Wells Fargo.
Otting twice tells lawmakers the OCC is "not comfortable" with where Wells Fargo is at in terms of its operations and compliance.
Red-state Dem two-step.		Heidi Heitkamp opens her questions by lamenting too big to fail banks, then pivots to talking about community bank relief in Crapo bill.
Sen. Brian Schatz on Wells Fargo: "This institution does seem beyond repair."
Otting to Warren: "If you don't understand the process of an ANPR, I'd be happy to explain it."		Warren: "Please. Please."
Warren and Otting having a testy exchange out the gate.		Otting: "I disagree with that statement."	Warren: "Yea, I'm sure you do."

Sen. Kennedy: "I could start a competitor to YouTube tomorrow."		I'm fairly certain he's speaking hypothetically.

Menendez effectively trying to separate McWilliams &amp; Quarles from Otting's efforts on CRA. Gets both of them to confirm that place still matters and that discriminatory lending does exist.

@reporterev OK, now McWatters got an actual question.		It's credit union's world and we're just living in it.
@reporterev In FSOC fashion, I will consider your appeal.		....		....		Your appeal has been rejected.
@reporterev I'm calling it a technicality -- he was being surveyed alongside others on market threats.
@CarterD Same boat as you. Monitoring from the bureau. We're seeking a transcript.
Quarles gives a lengthy, cautious answer on GSIB surcharge. Ties it to an entire "complex" of rules around big banks and says it must be considered with other regulatory pieces.
Quarles tells Brown he thinks, like Powell, that "the total loss absorbency capital capacity in our system is roughly about right."
Sherrod Brown opens ? by asking regulators if they would keep a person who made racist comments in charge (controversy roiling CFPB).		Attempts to duck, but Quarles says "racism has no place in the workplace" and McWilliams said such person would face disciplinary action.
Quarles says he expect a Fed proposal implementing rule easing for banks $100B-250B by the end of the year "and I hope well before that."

SEC's Avakian on Musk: "Neither celebrity status nor reputation as a technological innovator provides an exemption from federal securities laws."
The federal government wants to legally remove Elon Musk from Tesla and the news is struggling to break through.		What a Thursday.
Underrated aspect of the SEC's Tesla complaint is Elon Musk is 47 years old and only recently learned what "420" means.
Wherein Tesla's CFO apparently tries to do some clarifying after the Musk tweet: https://t.co/Py0rvMidYy
After the Musk tweet, SEC says a reporter emailed Musk asking "Is this just a 420 joke gone awry? Are you serious? It seems like you are dancing into some pretty legal territory."
SEC says after the Musk tweet, Tesla's own head of Investor Relations texted his chief of staff asking, "Was this text legit?"
SEC says Musk calculated a private price of $419, which he bumped to $420 "because he had recently learned about the number's significance in marijuana culture and thought his girlfriend 'would find it funny, which admittedly is not a great reason to pick a price.'"

For a man so singularly focused on undoing his predecessor's policy work, tapping someone who helped build post-crisis rules at the Fed to rejoin the Fed is a headscratcher.
She obviously is qualified for the position and well-respected in Fed circles. But from a regulatory side, it's striking to see the Trump administration pick someone intimately involved with building the post-crisis regulatory regime.

On the one hand, this is a bit of bureaucratic housekeeping.		On the other, it's also a pretty big step away from the aggressive post-crisis posture adopted by these same regulators.
@BrianRKnight who else?
GAO ruled last year that leveraged lending guidance DID amount to a rule, which meant Congress could repeal it. Which also kicked off a rush by regulators to clarify their guidance is not legally binding, lest an R-led Congress begin chopping away at years of work.
Banks and R's hated that, because guidance doesn't go through the traditional, rigorous and public rulewriting process. And it didn't appear to be subject to review (and potential repeal) by Congress under the CRA.
This move from regulators comes in the wake of criticism from Republicans and industry that examiners were using guidance as the basis for oversight and enforcement.
New: Bank regulators underline that guidance is guidance, and rules are rules. Only one has legal heft. And it's not guidance.		https://t.co/6lDeasrQZw
@reporterev @BrianRKnight @vtg2 If nothing else, it's probably helpful to at least have an initial blueprint to follow in the next crisis. Even if you eventually throw it out.		You know, as opposed to the prior way where a handful of guys were just making it up ad hoc as they went along.
@reporterev @kensweet @vtg2 @BrianRKnight The whole framework relies on policymakers sticking to the rules established pre-crisis in the midst of a crisis.		Particularly internationally, there will be a lot of pressure to protect your own in a way that makes the whole a lot harder.
@reporterev @BrianRKnight @vtg2 Yep. I can more easily envision OLA working for a single bank. But as you pointed out, what world exists where Citi faces collapse and JPM is rock solid?		Bigger question is what if OLA is insufficient and there's no political will for a bailout? Then what?
@vtg2 @BrianRKnight Most likely failure to my amateur eyes seems less due to OLA itself but the external climate where it would occur.		Market factors, political reaction, lack of public confidence (or some combo therein) make it so that OLA isn't enough.
@BrianRKnight @vtg2 I can absolutely see a situation where a big bank teeters and OLA works as intended.		I can also absolutely see a situation where OLA fails or is cast aside immediately as policymakers panic-hunt for another fix.
@vtg2 @BrianRKnight Isn't it also possible that he simply doesn't know the answer to the question?		That is, we have this set of tools, but we've never used them. So we don't know if the tools will work if we do use them.

And I'd contend that the most acute revolving door concerns aren't in Congress, but at the regulator/big law firm level. That's where the sausage really gets made and public/political pressure nonexistent compared to Congress
And this statistic struck me as strikingly *low* -- less than half of lawmakers and staff that steered policy through financial crisis stayed in that industry after Congress https://t.co/DV34Tca2eq
The cynical read of this is: congressional staff and lawmakers cash in &amp; sell out to big banks		A (perhaps too) tempered read is: people with experience on financial services issues continue to work on financial services issues
This is interesting, but I'd be curious to see what the "revolving door" looks like at other congressional committees as well:		https://t.co/ElbzYIWulG

Reading this, seems pretty clear there's zero buyer's remorse among that group. Main concerns laid out in the piece is how regulators' bailout authority was curtailed in post-crisis regulations.

@reporterev @JBSDC Hah. I do have to say that writing "Gary Cohn stole a document from Trump. BTW I have that document" doesn't do wonders for the mysteries of anonymous sourcing....
@JBSDC @reporterev Well, he almost resigned after Charlottesville (and made sure the world knew he thought about it), and then did after he lost a major policy fight.		So he was doing his best to keep the embers away.
@reporterev @JBSDC Think about how PR folks will sometimes rush to the biggest tire fire they can find as a great opportunity.		If you succeed, you're a miracle worker.		If you fail, it was already a tire fire.		Either way, it's a great resume line.		Kind of similar dynamic here.
