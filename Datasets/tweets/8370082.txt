Q11 via @StevenL57: May I assume that all volunteers are responsible for their own housing needs? #ConventionVols
A10: There will be a Volunteer Appreciation Party on July 21st at @penns_landing in Philly! #ConventionVols
Q10 via @taratdavis: Are you doing anything fun for volunteers? #ConventionVols
A9: The Convention requires credentials/not open to the public. Vols are not guaranteed access to Convention-related events. #ConventionVols
Q9 via @amktweets: Can volunteers get credentials for venues in the convention? #ConventionVols
A8: No, we're just looking for people who are excited about Philadelphia and can help us show all the city has to offer. #ConventionVols
Q8 via @shmalarie: Would independent voters be a valued segment of vols or is it required they are registered Democrat? #ConventionVols

Q4 via @SmilingResh: #ConventionVols Is registering on the site enough or do we need to do anything else to volunteer?
A3: We need volunteers of all skills and walks of life. Our volunteers should reflect the diversity of Philly &amp; the nation. #ConventionVols
Q3 via @RPaoAle: What skills/talents should volunteers have in order to qualify? #ConventionVols
A2: Bring your family! Each individual must create a profile. In registering there's a field to include group affiliation. #ConventionVols
Q2 via @DavidHCrosson: My family would like to volunteer together, will there be a way to indicate that? #ConventionVols
A1: Thanks @gab_meunier! Role and shift selection will likely be late May; we look forward to being in touch with you then. #ConventionVols
