Broadband is a core economic issue.

To correct 2 big inaccuracies:		1) Our bill uses a process that has been used 1000s of times to pay contractors.

Annie, a Duluth resident, landed her dream job working as a¬†chemist at the @EPA but she‚Äôs had to file for unemployment bc of the shutdown.¬†Fed workers &amp; fed contract workers, like Annie, do important work. We must open the government so they can get back to work &amp; get paid.
About to sit down with @HardballChris to discuss the latest shutdown news and my bill to secure back pay for federal contract workers. These Americans‚Äîjanitors, cafeteria staff, security guards‚Äîaren‚Äôt getting paid and haven‚Äôt received back pay after past shutdowns. Tune in.

Hey @MN_Chamber, thank you for calling for an end to Trump‚Äôs shutdown. It‚Äôs a complete waste of taxpayer dollars and I've heard from Minnesotans about how it‚Äôs hurting their businesses. We need to open the government ASAP. Minnesotans are counting on it.	https://t.co/VGdVp9jZ0R

Trump‚Äôs shutdown may have lasting damage to education in Minnesota. The shutdown is costing the University of Minnesota about $500K A DAY to make up for the lack of federal funding, disrupting important research. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/isndBhUhAe
Federal contract employees are too often invisible. And get this‚Äîthey‚Äôre not getting paid and haven‚Äôt received back pay after previous shutdowns.

On the eve of last day to sign up for health coverage, threats are being made abt critical health care millions rely on.		ACA is still the law of the land. Today is the last day to sign up for Jan. 1 coverage in MN through @MNsure. If you‚Äôve already enrolled, you have coverage!
I spent yesterday visiting two detention centers‚Äîthey are billed as residences, but that is the wrong word. Residences are where people live. These places are jails. I took some time to write about my day in Texas yesterday, and I hope you give it a read: https://t.co/86mfim1rDi
Ruling by federal judge in TX to undermine historic health care legislation‚Äîif the decision is allowed to stand‚Äîwould be catastrophic. It would rob millions of health care coverage and would return us to the days when people could be denied coverage bc of pre-existing conditions.
Spent the day visiting two child and family detention centers in Texas. Seeing all of this is one thing, but I want to be a part of coming up with solutions to reform our immigration system too. We need to stand up for kids and families. https://t.co/vCuHmOj823
I think no matter what you think about immigration policy, we can all agree this level of human suffering is unconscionable. Please keep sharing these stories.
Some say they were told that if they request medical care multiple times, they will be deported.
I‚Äôve heard about how medical units are being used to house people as ‚Äúpunishment‚Äù even if the offense is something like a 2-yr-old hitting another 2-yr-old.
So far, I‚Äôve heard about a fourteen-year-old who has been in custody for five months and may shortly be ‚Äúcelebrating‚Äù her Quincea√±era there. I‚Äôve been told she‚Äôs having suicidal thoughts.
I‚Äôm at America‚Äôs southern border, where I'll be seeing firsthand how families and kids are being treated at three detention centers in Texas. https://t.co/mI4RGvdtJb
Last June this country rose up &amp; condemned Trump‚Äôs zero tolerance policy of separating kids from their parents. I‚Äôm at the border today to understand what‚Äôs happening w/ many of the 15K kids in custody &amp; how this tragic death of a 7-year-old girl happened.https://t.co/PQ8SxNKqqL
I'm currently on my way to the U.S. southern border. I'll be seeing firsthand how families &amp; kids are being treated at three detention centers in TX. @SenJeffMerkley, @maziehirono, @RepJudyChu, &amp; @RepBetoORourke will be there too. I'll be sharing as much as I can with you all.
Ten. Consecutive. Wins. 	 	Oh, and zero losses. 	 	@GopherWBB is one of only four undefeated teams in the country. Couldn‚Äôt be prouder of the team and @Lindsay_13‚Äôs inaugural year as Gopher head coach.	 	#TheWinningWhay https://t.co/eii7d6IKpA
We need to make sure that the Senate, just like any other workplace in the US, is a place where women &amp; men can feel that they are safe, that they are protected &amp; that they can do their very best work.

A #FarmBill, bills passed for expanded mental health services in schools and improved opportunities for career and technical education. Lots more work to do, and I‚Äôve got lots of energy to do it with you.		(Photo via Brian Peterson, StarTribune)
#TBT to one year ago today, when I stepped up to the challenge of serving Minnesota as U.S. Senator. The last year has included a swearing in and election, a DC apartment during the week, countless trips around Minnesota and too few days with Archie and the kids. https://t.co/OKqrAxSQ4E
Today I helped the Senate pass a historic vote to limit U.S. military support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. We've been supporting a campaign that‚Äôs killed thousands and thousands of people and created a humanitarian nightmare. A complete disgrace. https://t.co/C8EzgTYPb9
The House passed the bipartisan #FarmBill this afternoon. Now, it‚Äôs headed to the President‚Äôs desk for his signature. We need to provide farm country with certainty and predictability by getting this bill over the finish line ASAP. https://t.co/OCeHDJZSjr
Glad to work with you, Senator @JerryMoran, on this bipartisan bill to help make life-saving cancer treatment more affordable for people in Minnesota, Kansas, and across the country. https://t.co/W4uUYzaShV
People should be at the center of our elections, not deep-pocketed special interests. That‚Äôs why today I voted for a measure to crack down on #DarkMoney. Glad it passed the Senate. https://t.co/S1fxBQTiPr
Thanks to cancer treatment advancements, ppl can take life-saving oral cancer meds in the comfort of their home, much less intrusive than IV chemo.		But insurance plans often don‚Äôt cover these drugs in the same way as tradt'l chemo.		I have a bill w/ @JerryMoran to help fix this.
Minnesotan Kaywin Feldman is headed to Washington D.C. to be Director of @ngadc after more than a decade of leadership at @artsmia. Congrats, @KaywinFeldman. I‚Äôd love to have you come by my Washington office when you‚Äôre here! https://t.co/70fH149jIc
Today the Senate passed the bipartisan #FarmBill. At a time when so many Americans are frustrated with divisive politics, it‚Äôs worth pausing over the way members of both parties have come together to produce such an important bill through hard work and compromise. A few thoughts: https://t.co/vmxfiGu5OL
Minnesotans and anyone who goes to court deserves to have their cases heard by fair, impartial, and qualified judges‚ÄìEighth Circuit Judge nominee Jonathan Kobes is none of those things. So I voted against his confirmation today.
It‚Äôs true! The Senate will take up a vote on the #FarmBill this afternoon. I urge my colleagues to come together and support this bill so we can provide our nation‚Äôs farmers, ranchers, rural communities, and tribes with certainty and predictability. https://t.co/7D2CfvvPpM
There are approximately 2.2 million people in prison in this country, many of whom are non-violent offenders with low-level offenses. And our system disproportionately affects people of color. 	 	Hopeful we‚Äôll soon vote on the #FirstStepAct.	 	https://t.co/yQhMlybom1
Clean energy is good for MN's economy. An example:	 	Metro Transit's shifting to an all-electric bus fleet. Those new buses will come from New Flyer's St. Cloud plant, supporting local jobs.	 	More cities should move to electric, and I‚Äôm pushing a bill to help make that happen. https://t.co/JM0olRWMvW
I was struck by this story describing how many people with diabetes are literally ‚Äúfighting for their lives.‚Äù It‚Äôs all too familiar‚ÄîI‚Äôve heard devastating stories from Minnesotans. There is no reason why anyone should have to choose between their medication and other basic needs. https://t.co/avAXGWEOCe
.@NPR reporters @Chris_ArnoldNPR and @NPRCoryTurner deserve credit for bringing light to this important issue. I‚Äôm not done pushing for improvements to this program because we need to empower aspiring educators instead of saddling them with debt. https://t.co/XFAApOXUZe
There‚Äôs a secret lingo that pharma uses to rake in profits at the expense of patients: 		Sandbox=Market for generics	Fair Share=Divide the pie so profits go up	Trash the Market=Selling at a ‚Üì price than agreed on in back-room deals 		We need to hold these companies accountable. https://t.co/DknjmWs9I2
4,800 TEACH grants for students who went to college in MN were converted to loans. When I heard this I urged @usedgov to right this wrong.

77 years ago, a surprise attack on our nation killed thousands and drew our nation into the deadliest conflict in human history.	 	We must never forget the sacrifices that so many made that day to keep the hope of our nation alive in one of its darkest hours.

At first glance, the EPA‚Äôs #RFS Rule may look ok. But the devil is in the details. 		It fails to crack down on bogus waivers that big refineries use to exempt themselves from RFS standards. This abuse will destroy biofuel demand, and hurt Minnesota ag and our economy.

Seats on the bench should be filled by people who understand that voting is a sacred right. Today is a victory for voting rights because we kept Thomas Farr from serving on the district court. You made your voices heard and spoke up‚Äîthis is a win by the people, for the people.

Widespread famine, bombings that have killed thousands of civilians, the murder of a journalist, a massive humanitarian crisis. The Trump Administration funding the Saudi coalition in Yemen sends the message that the US supports these atrocities. And that's a complete disgrace.

Sitting down to talk with students always leaves me inspired. And that‚Äôs exactly how I felt yesterday after meeting with @MNYouthCouncil members at my office in St. Paul. https://t.co/VyXRs3uCP2 https://t.co/PwSFvO1IHm
There‚Äôs still a lot of work left to do to help Minnesota communities rebuild from June and July‚Äôs heavy flooding, high winds, and tornadoes. I‚Äôm urging the President to let @FEMA help Minnesota rebuild. https://t.co/1Pqx3npMI0 https://t.co/j9gWfB15Mg
#TBT to reading The Story of Ferdinand to @MrsOverdahl‚Äôs third grade class at Northport Elementary (@ISD281) in February. It‚Äôs about a bull who prefers smelling flowers to bullfighting, and it‚Äôs one of my favorites. #NationalBookLoversDay https://t.co/yufwbxCMeY
Pork chop on a stick‚Äîever tried it? It‚Äôs a @MNFarmfest classic. I got one while talking to @MNFFA members. Some of my favorite Ag meetings in Washington are when I meet with these young farmers, so it was fun to see them in Minnesota. https://t.co/L9qgwfW8a2
Fed up. That's how Minnesotans feel about how much they have to pay for their health care‚Äîespecially the price of Rx drugs. I‚Äôm focused on finding solutions and today¬†in Duluth I talked about a bill¬†I‚Äôll be introducing to¬†help bring ‚Üì costs. https://t.co/RrZMpZ1MJp
Arvonne Fraser inspired many of us‚Äîwomen and men‚Äîto go out and fight for what we believed in, no excuses. The world is a better, more just place because she was in it. She was funny, incisive, big-hearted, and loved by many. https://t.co/D3gAH8U55B
Our voting laws reflect our beliefs about who should have a voice in this nation. I'm proud to represent the state w/ the highest voter turnout. Our next #SCOTUS Justice should defend every citizen's right to vote. More on #WhatsAtStake w/ Judge Kavanaugh: https://t.co/iw50bG4wO4
Breaking bread while talking about the bread &amp; butter issues that are important to Minnesota's ag community. That's my favorite part of @MNFarmfest each year. I had lunch w/ Rep. Collin Peterson, &amp; the new @CattlemenMN's Beef Barn looks great and was shelter from the rain. #MNAg https://t.co/MrbXysMH6r
That‚Äôs right‚Äîand I‚Äôve pushed to expand our export markets and called for a clear plan to help our farmers and producers. Happy to talk to people like @MNSoyGrowers Director Paul Freeman at #Farmfest18. https://t.co/DNwyiBfZ5T
Talking farm policy, learning about new farm technology, attending educational demonstrations, and eating the best corn ice cream you'll ever have. #Farmfest18 has a lot to offer. Don't forget to stop by my official Senate booth (it's 3610) in Redwood County. https://t.co/x6iEjyoeQA

On this day in 1965, the #VotingRightsAct was signed into law‚Äîa milestone in outlawing discriminatory voting practices. Our next #SCOTUS Justice must protect this hard-won, fundamental right and not reverse course on progress. Brett Kavanaugh is not that Justice. #WhatsAtStake
Economic issues like the price of Rx drugs and monthly rent help determine whether or not people can build the lives they want. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs on Minnesotans‚Äô minds, and what I‚Äôm focused on here in the Senate. https://t.co/6jFBC3eqXW
I know that the best farm policy is one that ensures Minnesota producers get a good price for their farm products. In my recent op-ed, I talk about making farm and trade policies work for Minnesotans &amp; the need to sign the Farm Bill into law. https://t.co/t9b6fZYK5U

25 years ago today, Ruth Bader Ginsburg was confirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court‚Äîjust the second woman to serve as a Justice. Her leadership and fierce advocacy for equal rights remain just as important today as they did in 1993.
I believe that all Americans should be represented here in the Senate, not just the wealthy few. Our democracy is built on the principle that the American people have the power in our elections. So I‚Äôm fighting to reform our campaign finance rules. #FixDemocracyNow https://t.co/YDMLJ8sRrj
Textbooks are often an overlooked, costly expense. I helped secure funding for a pilot w/ @SenatorDurbin &amp; @SenAngusKing to help students access free online textbooks. But it's only going to save students $$$ if we implement it correctly. @BetsyDeVosED, that's where you come in. https://t.co/oeDktuYDsN
When I ask teachers about what keeps them up at night, they often tell me they worry about the mental health challenges many of their students face. That‚Äôs why I intro'd a bill to make sure students can access mental health services in schools. More here: https://t.co/Xyh45LG0iN
This week a Minnesotan shared with my office that some expecting moms in her community have had to take out loans‚Äîyes, loans‚Äîto cover the costs of their children‚Äôs deliveries. More here: https://t.co/PaFR5U2yWm https://t.co/ELQMjff8rI
Good news: My provision to help preserve affordable rental homes in rural areas is one step closer to becoming law after clearing the Senate yesterday. Affordable housing makes significant improvements to the lives of Minnesota families and we need to make sure there‚Äôs enough.
In total abandonment of the @EPA‚Äôs purpose‚Äîprotecting the environment‚Äî the Trump administration announced plans to roll back rules on car pollution today. Even some car companies don't want to curb these rules. An unnecessary attack on our environment. https://t.co/1Vj9NHLATf

When I hear about health care costs from Minnesotans, I hear frustrations over the struggle to afford care and high out-of-pocket charges. Today I pressed health care experts for more info on ways we can save money for families &amp; cut red tape when they try to access care. Watch: https://t.co/9IODz1RShz
Rural EMS providers are critical to helping Minnesota communities stay safe but many struggle to retain staff, have working equipment &amp; even stay open due to lack of $. That‚Äôs why I'm cosponsoring @SenatorDurbin &amp; @SenPatRoberts‚Äô bill to renew a grant program for these providers.

In February, Minnesotans shared stories with me about how they‚Äôd be harmed by cuts to #Medicaid. The stories haven't stopped. Last week in Olivia, providers stressed that Medicaid helps families. That's why I'm fighting any cuts to #Medicaid53. https://t.co/y5SlLp2uH8
Sometimes paying for your Rx drugs with cash is cheaper than using insurance. But you might not know that bc the pharma industry uses ‚Äúgag clauses‚Äù to prevent your pharmacist from telling you this. That‚Äôs unacceptable‚Äîand I helped advance a bill to end it. https://t.co/Jb5IDJU6fH

DeVos‚Äô proposal to roll back guardrails protecting students from bogus programs at for-profit colleges‚Äîwhich load students up w/ debt but offer little in the way of earnings‚Äîshows she'd rather support special interests over students &amp; taxpayers. Unsurprising, but still shameful. https://t.co/BVlhAXvltE
Trump‚Äôs trade war &amp; skyrocketing Rx prices are on the top of Minnesotans‚Äô minds. I‚Äôve talked to one farmer who says they lost an estimated $100,000 in just one month due to Trump‚Äôs tariffs. And I‚Äôve met a mom who‚Äôs being price gouged by big pharma when buying her child #insulin. https://t.co/GXynASmW7Z

Right now I‚Äôm with fellow Democratic women senators, @PPFA, and @NARAL to call for protecting women‚Äôs reproductive rights, in light of President Trump‚Äôs nomination of Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Watch live: https://t.co/euT7190nrQ
I know that when women do not have the freedom to make their own choices about their reproductive health care, they have lost the freedom to direct their own lives‚Äîtheir personal lives, their family, their economic security.
Without question, the number one issue I hear about from Minnesotans is the rising cost of health care. I've launched an outreach tour to hear from those who‚Äôve experienced the consequences of high health care costs firsthand: https://t.co/NPq1gg2ZHg https://t.co/QNbkaGmn1M
Women don't need the government looking over their shoulder in the examination room, telling them what they can and cannot do. But #SCOTUS nominee Judge Kavanaugh could overturn Roe and restrict women‚Äôs freedom when it comes to health care. #WhatsAtStake
Last week I saw first-hand just how hard communities in SW Minnesota were hit by recent flooding.

The Trump Admin‚Äôs failure to meet a court-ordered deadline to return 102 "tender age" children‚Äîkids under 5-years-old‚Äîto their families shows how unprepared it was to face the consequences of its inhumane zero-tolerance policy. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/S1RTXFunet

Tough talk is not enough. The American people need real policies from you and @SecAzar that hold pharmaceutical companies accountable. Especially ones that won‚Äôt send pharma stock prices soaring. https://t.co/AuSEO4zFXc

Health care costs‚Äîespecially prescription drug prices‚Äîare out of control. Today I joined Fox 9 reporter @courtneygodfrey and a Minnesota mom named Lija for a conversation about how we can fight for solutions now. Hope you tune in to @FOX9 at 9:25 and 10:15 PM CT tonight. https://t.co/h2M55cNJ60
I saw a lot of the damage from the recent flooding in southwestern Minnesota firsthand, and I don‚Äôt want people already going through tough times to have to deal with scams on top of what they‚Äôve been through. Please be wary of this: https://t.co/JO7MU23YXJ
The ‚ÄúP‚Äù in EPA stands for Protection. So if the Trump Administration‚Äôs Environmental Protection Agency doesn‚Äôt seem to be protecting the environment or us Americans, who exactly are they looking out for? https://t.co/Vazfr8sH27
It‚Äôs been a hard enough time in farm country for many Minnesotans, and I know the recent flooding in southwestern Minnesota is especially tough for families. Full recap and photos from what I saw in MN today here: https://t.co/mDWi3PfZRn https://t.co/QZHIVo8axa
You know you‚Äôre in Minnesota when the sandwich you order is called the Ya-You-Betcha. Stopped in for lunch at The Plaid Moose in Slayton. Cc: @IndignantMN https://t.co/JzU7Co7hoM
Talked to a homeowner who has to take a 20 mile detour because this is the current state of the Des Moines River. I‚Äôm w/ @GovMarkDayton, @MNagriculture Commissioner Frederickson, &amp; Joe Kelly from @MnDPS_AGED. Now en route to Walnut Grove &amp; I‚Äôll keep you updated when we get there. https://t.co/gsPKhI8exT
Here‚Äôs what I saw with @GovMarkDayton as we surveyed the flood damage before pulling up to Slayton, MN. Thanks to emergency management staff, community members, and other officials who are working together to help Minnesotans affected by the recent flooding. It‚Äôs a team effort. https://t.co/o6ZAyHYbqR
Southwestern Minnesota has been hit hard by severe weather, and we need to help. Today, I'll be assessing the damage in Slayton, Walnut Grove, Balaton, &amp; other areas with @GovMarkDayton, Congressman Collin Peterson, @MNagriculture Commissioner Dave Frederickson, and @MnDPS_AGED.
Scott Pruitt abused our trust. I‚Äôm glad he stepped down. I had repeatedly called on him to do so, and now the Trump Admin needs to replace him with somebody who has the integrity and effectiveness to fight for our environment. After all, that‚Äôs the job of the EPA Administrator.
As a Minnesotan, a woman, and someone who's committed to expanding workforce development, there's so much I love about @dunwoodycollege and @GirlScoutsRV helping girls explore construction trades through building homes. Check this out from @MinnPost: https://t.co/2LDKvPOwfI
#TBT to Minnesotans welcoming me into their towns, letting me visit them at school, gathering in our state‚Äôs beautiful parks, &amp; making me laugh at the @mnstatefair. I really enjoy these conversations. But more than that, thanks for sharing your lives. I'm honored to work for you. https://t.co/30q8TjMafX
Happy #FourthofJuly. Let‚Äôs celebrate our independence and reflect on the laws, history, and diverse groups of people who make up our nation. And as we commemorate 242 years of America and gather together, let‚Äôs recognize that the fight for freedom continues.
I recently met a Minnesota mom, veteran, and former Olympian who pays $15,000+ out of pocket annually for the drug that keeps her cancer in check. That‚Äôs absurd. I‚Äôm working to hold the drug industry accountable, and find solutions to ‚Üì prices. https://t.co/YOxjm5VZMJ
Oh I didn‚Äôt forget, I was saving that for dessert. But now that you bring it up, you can also enjoy sweet corn ice cream BEFORE eating a pork chop on a stick. https://t.co/wcQCAIsoHu
Just a little over a month until #MNFarmfest. I've been before, but this will be my first time as U.S. Senator. Still really looking forward to the renowned pork chop on a stick and talking farm policy. Will you be there? #MNAg https://t.co/j0FUBubDZv
3.4 billion. That‚Äôs how many robocalls were made in just one month this spring. This onslaught makes it clear that we need to be doing more to make sure our laws are appropriately protecting consumers. I‚Äôm pressing @FCC to do exactly that. More here: https://t.co/fPGBbb5WaF
The #opioid crisis knows no bounds, and even impacts newborn babies in our state. Grateful for the work that Minnesotans like @AFSCMEMN5 are doing to help moms and babies with opioid addictions get the help and support they need to live healthier lives. https://t.co/bXXqYfgabD
So I recently led a letter to @BetsyDeVosED w/ 18 Senate colleagues abt teachers being unfairly forced to repay $ for funds originally promised as grants. We asked for a response from @usedgov by next Fri but in the meantime @NPR has more &amp; it‚Äôs alarming: https://t.co/wKzB32hWaX
And thank you, @HungerSolutions, for joining me! #FarmBill programs that help fight hunger are of vital importance. The data backs this up. MNs made approx. 3 million visits to local food shelves last yr &amp; we know that many families still lack access to nutritious, healthy meals. https://t.co/RWZ4FKJzz8
I fought to get a provision included in the #FarmBill that will help promote diversity in farming because we need to support all farmers. Grateful for the opportunity to hear from Pakou Hang of Hmong American Farmers Assoc. (@HAFAfarmers) this weekend. https://t.co/9WvHvENoUU
Today I met with farm, business, energy, and hunger leaders at St. Paul Farmers Market to discuss the importance of the #FarmBill, which will impact virtually every Minnesotan. I'm fighting to get it over the finish line &amp; signed into law ASAP. https://t.co/J6Dup5Z9vE https://t.co/r60Wa66saL
Some children who have been separated from their families as a result of the Trump Administration are so traumatized they can‚Äôt speak. So we are raising our voices‚Äîand taking part in marches across the country‚Äîfor those who have been scared into silence. #FamiliesBelongTogether
Hey @SecNielsen &amp; Trump Admin‚Äîhave you seen Trump's @StateDept report warning against separation of children from their families, citing serious health effects? Exactly why I‚Äôm calling for a hearing on health impacts of your zero-tolerance policy. We must help separated kids. https://t.co/9v1vAKYcQy
Pushing the #FarmBill through the Senate. Tackling skyrocketing Rx prices. Fighting to help separated families.

When somebody buys a plane ticket, they should trust it guarantees travel &amp; that they‚Äôll get home. It‚Äôs that simple. But this yr, Sun Country Airlines stranded travelers, leaving them scrambling. I‚Äôve intro‚Äôd a bill to hold airlines accountable. More here: https://t.co/zw98vx2Acs

Big news for Minnesota: today the 2018 bipartisan Senate #FarmBill passed. This is a great example of how the Senate can get things done when we work together. I‚Äôm so proud to have been able to make sure Minnesota priorities were included. https://t.co/OHH760Ud8r
Horrified by today‚Äôs shooting at Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland. Peace be with those injured and those who have lost loved ones. Courage to those in Congress who could pass commonsense reforms to help end this violence.
My staff &amp; I held 30+ listening sessions w/ Minnesotans across the state to make sure MN priorities are in the #FarmBill. Grateful for their input‚Äîit helped me get key provisions incl. in the bill. Today I took to the Senate floor to highlight these wins: https://t.co/3ezXoZHdsD https://t.co/xViYqpqQZP
That‚Äôs right. Drug companies have spent hundreds of millions of $ to rig the rules &amp; protect huge profits. From Jan. thru March of this year the drug industry trade group‚ÄîPhRMA‚Äîspent nearly $10 million on lobbying, breaking their quarterly record. Obscene. I‚Äôm here to fight back. https://t.co/GtWkOJbvOR
This is a pivotal moment. Justice Kennedy‚Äôs retirement means the stakes are high for choosing a replacement committed to the Constitution &amp; protecting basic rights. GOP must be held to their own standard: with E-Day so close, voters should choose who provides advice &amp; consent. https://t.co/PBqkvO0NJ1
Always great to see you and hear your passion for robotics, @FIRSTteam1816. And yep, you‚Äôve got it right: I‚Äôm a big advocate for #STEM education, and strengthening our nation‚Äôs workforce programs. https://t.co/sbXbKVH11q
I hope he keeps his word, especially as the White House seeks to make funding cuts to clean energy research at the Department of Energy. Our economy and our planet can‚Äôt afford to take this step backwards.https://t.co/17maUDyCt2
Yesterday I asked a nominee to be in charge of renewable energy if he believes that we should have affordable, reliable and clean energy that‚Äôs good for public health and mitigates effects of climate change. He said yes. https://t.co/auL726wyMd
Deeply disappointed in Supreme Court's decision to weaken this key protection for public sector employees. We must fight against far-right, corporate-funded, special interests which backed this case‚Äîand keep defending working families across the country. https://t.co/GfMxotNjj1
The EPA needs to step up and ensure that our nation meets the 19.88 billion target, and I plan to hold them accountable for doing so. https://t.co/BmBVZvsxnd
But if the EPA is going continue to allow refineries to get around RFS requirements by granting them waivers, the amount of ethanol and other renewables used in the nation‚Äôs fuel supply will fall far short of the target levels announced today.
A strong Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) is critically important to Minnesota, where ethanol produced from corn creates an estimated $6.7 billion in economic output and supports almost 18,000 jobs across the state.
Today‚Äôs decision by the Supreme Court goes against the founding principles of our nation and defies our core beliefs. We must keep working to help all people demand respect, freedom and dignity in the same spirit on which our country was founded. https://t.co/a9AJmNOUM7
Taking the time to listen may seem like a lost art in Washington, but it‚Äôs how I do my job every day. Today I sat down w/ MNs from CHS, a farmer-owned coop, to hear concerns abt the current climate of uncertainty &amp; how it may hurt farmers‚Äô bottom lines. Thanks for the visit, CHS. https://t.co/IRAHUx4Mxz
Three years ago today, the Supreme Court confirmed what Minnesotans have known for years‚Äîlove is love. But making sure all Americans have equal rights and protections guaranteed by the Constitution? We're still fighting. I'm with you, and I'm not going anywhere. #MarriageEquality
In my recent op-ed, I talk about bringing my office to Minnesotans so they can have a voice in Washington. Read more here: 	https://t.co/dSCFzdLTgC
I want to help Minnesota continue this progress. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve introduced a legislative roadmap for the energy section of the #FarmBill to help #MNAg deploy renewable energy and energy efficiency. My bill will also strengthen programs that have already seen success, like REAP.
Minnesota's a leader in renewable energy and it‚Äôs always great to see folks working to keep us moving in the right direction. Check out how @CityofRedWingMN is working to encourage locals to explore energy efficiency and renewable energy options:	https://t.co/EZhZNNspV3
End of May: President says prescription drug companies will make ‚Äúvoluntary, massive drops in prices‚Äù in 2 weeks.	Early June: None of the 10 major pharma companies @SenWarren &amp; I reached out to provide meaningful specifics on a plan to lower Rx drug prices.https://t.co/tpx6HnR7BB
A MN mom came to one of my prescription drug discussions and brought her daughter‚Äôs insulin pens. She walked me through what it would cost to get the same life-saving medicine in other countries. And then told me how much she pays here in America. The discrepancy is shocking. https://t.co/g6ENbhcibp
Congrats on the fourth consecutive win, @minnesotalynx! Whether I‚Äôm at a game in Minnesota or watching from afar, it‚Äôs always exciting to cheer you on. And it was great to see you all not too long ago in Washington.	https://t.co/fb3tk7aiBm
100% agree, @USATODAY. The North Shore Scenic Drive along Lake Superior is breathtaking. #OnlyInMN https://t.co/wW2nwgCcNb
Not everybody needs to attend a 4-yr college. But everyone should be able to find good-paying jobs. I have a bill focused on this &amp; here's another great MN effort to help students: https://t.co/sbjsXqiISC
Facilitating conversations about mental health is an important step toward eliminating the stigma that prevents too many, incl. students, from seeking care. I intro‚Äôd a bill to create a nat‚Äôl commission to help address mental health concerns students face. https://t.co/JQFcqp91fC
Congratulations on this well-deserved award, @CTUL_TC, and thank you for your steadfast commitment to improving working conditions for Minnesotans. Everyone should be able to live and work with dignity. https://t.co/xwofNyhO3H
Watch this powerful interview with Dr. Marc Gorelick on why it‚Äôs urgent that we reunite families and stop family separations now: https://t.co/p8kxaLaF8O
We know that ripping kids away from their families can be devastating for children, &amp; the damage caused by these separations can last a lifetime. I'm calling on the Senate Health Committee to hold a hearing on the health &amp; well-being of detained children. https://t.co/QVhnXVVG2Y
That‚Äôs ludicrous. Pharma companies need to be held accountable for jacking up the price of drugs that people need to survive. I‚Äôm working to take on the pharma industry &amp; rein in drug industry profits that are borne on the back of patients who are paying too much for their drugs.
A MN woman recently showed me insulin pens that she bought for her daughter in other countries around the world. She told me that prices for the pens ranged from $8 to $18. In the U.S., she explained that this exact insulin pen‚Äîmade by the same manufacturer‚Äîcosts her family $140.
Let me tell you why the skyrocketing price of prescription drugs is alarming to me, and why it should be to you, too. https://t.co/Qzx2OkTxes
Disappointed the House passed a partisan #FarmBill. Thanks to my Minnesota colleagues who voted against this bill. I‚Äôm fighting to protect programs that help feed Minnesotans and Americans in the Senate Farm Bill. https://t.co/kQTYXni41P
We have to ensure that the more than 2,300 children who have already been separated are safely reunited with their families and receive the care they need as soon as possible.		https://t.co/oOqYWuhYu5
I‚Äôm calling on leaders of the Senate Health Committee to hold a hearing because we must hold the Trump Administration accountable for the 	negative consequences resulting from the traumatic stress children experienced as a result of Trump‚Äôs policy.
If we don‚Äôt address trauma inflicted on children, we pass that trauma on to future generations.
I want to give more MNs the freedom to work, compete, &amp; live their lives the way they want. That‚Äôs why I led an effort to build out #broadband to rural areas &amp; upgrade internet speeds. I‚Äôm glad it was included in the #FarmBill‚Äîit‚Äôs 1 of many things we need to address this issue.
A Minnesotan named Adam wanted to open a high-tech 3D printing company in his rural community. Thanks to reliable internet access, he was able to start his business in Gibbon, MN‚Äîa small town of about 750 people. https://t.co/E0ec9Hx4RI
Congrats to Eric Koser (@EKphys), a physics teacher at Mankato West High School, for being selected to help map the ocean off the coast of Alaska aboard @NOAA ship Rainier. Sounds like an exciting experience that you‚Äôll be able to share with your students back in Minnesota. https://t.co/9jmurFRftn
If we‚Äôre serious about helping veterans access the care and benefits they earned, then we need to sit down and listen to what they have to say. 	https://t.co/5wahFZcjlu https://t.co/Bgs9JfYn67
I asked @SecretarySonny to extend the enrollment period for the Margin Protection Program so we could get more Minnesotans signed up. I‚Äôm glad he heeded my call. Dairy farmers: there are 2 days left to enroll in this program, which helps folks face difficult yrs &amp; prevent losses.
Yesterday I listened to some inspiring students from @moundsviewhigh and @MapleGroveSrHS describe their innovative business ideas, which have earned them spots in @JAUpperMidwest‚Äôs Company of the Year Competition in Washington. Best of luck. https://t.co/UTNnN0Hzre
Mental health services need to be available to Minnesotans where and when they need them. @umash_umn shared info with my team today at a meeting in St. Paul about #AgResilience, and I'm supporting a bill that would bolster addressing mental health needs in the ag community. #MNAg
Grateful for the opportunity to welcome students from the Boys and Girls Club (@BGCA_Clubs) of White Earth Reservation to Washington today. Enjoy your @CloseUp_DC trip to our nation‚Äôs capitol. https://t.co/AIavzlgVt3
We lost my mother to Alzheimer‚Äôs not quite 2 yrs ago. It was a long &amp; difficult good bye so meeting w/ @alzMNND today &amp; hearing their stories was important to me for many reasons. Millions of Americans are affected by this disease &amp; I‚Äôm pushing to ramp up funding to help #EndALZ. https://t.co/dWppjWmuQa
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm sending my staff across MN to hear about challenges veterans face in securing earned benefits, &amp; explain how I can advocate on their behalf. If you‚Äôre a MN veteran who needs help accessing benefits, please know that you can always call my office at (651) 221-1016.
We need to address veterans' health needs, and that includes making sure they‚Äôre able to access the care and benefits they earned.
We can only help people when we take the time to listen to them. Yesterday in Waseca my staff heard two Vietnam veterans talk about the difficulties they face when it comes to accessing mental health services. https://t.co/RAm4oh67Sf
This stop is part of my state wide effort to make sure Minnesotans know how I can go to bat for them when they need help working with a federal agency. Services are open to the public‚Äîno appointment needed. For more info, feel free to call my office at (651) 221-1016.
TONIGHT‚Üí My staff will be at Inter-County Community Council (121 2nd Street West) in Thief River Falls from 6 to 8 p.m. to meet with Minnesotans who need help working with federal agencies.
.@SenateMajLdr, that‚Äôs wonderful news! When can we expect you and your fellow Republicans to join all 49 Dem Senators in supporting @SenFeinstein‚Äôs bill to fix this? And assume you‚Äôll be calling that up for a vote this week? https://t.co/e4VOoCVa0y
Improving access and increasing opportunity for Americans to build the lives they want. That's what I work on doing each day in this job, and that's why I fought to include help for vets to get more info about apprenticeships, job training, &amp; education included in the #FarmBill.
That‚Äôs why I led an effort to build out broadband to rural communities and upgrade internet speeds. I was very pleased to get it added to the #FarmBill. This is just one of many things we need to be doing to address this issue.
I couldn‚Äôt agree more. If we‚Äôre going to build an economy that works for everyone, we must prioritize high-speed internet. Expanding rural broadband is about helping all Minnesotans connect and compete.
Today at a @FarmFoundation event in Faribault my staff heard Minnesotans‚Äîincluding Bruce Miller of @MNFarmersUnion‚Äîsay that broadband is critical to supporting rural farmers and agribusinesses. https://t.co/y7ekPBysG8
We have a humanitarian crisis at our border manufactured by President Trump and his team. We are using cruelty to children as a public policy, and it‚Äôs unconscionable. Today I spoke with @PoppyHarlowCNN about the need for immediate action to stop this. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/XGSVx6kQqD
This is a moment of moral responsibility‚Äîand I hope clarity‚Äîfor our country. In just a few minutes, I‚Äôll be talking with @PoppyHarlowCNN about the need to #KeepFamiliesTogether. Tune in to @CNN.
I‚Äôll be on @CNN around 10:15 AM ET to discuss the cruel practice of separating children from moms and dads‚Äîboth at the border and with families already in our own country‚Äîwith @PoppyHarlowCNN.
But she‚Äôs denied that this is happening at all, and then said that she ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt apologize‚Äù for what‚Äôs happening to families. @SecNielsen has lost the credibility and the moral authority to lead this agency. https://t.co/h3A7kQ6BTk
And despite what @SecNielsen claims, this is a policy of this administration, who has repeatedly and publicly said they would implement it, calling it a ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù policy‚Äîa policy Secretary Nielsen is responsible for overseeing.
Some 2,300 children were separated from their parents at the border between May 5 and June 9. That is plainly wrong. It runs counter to who we are as a country. https://t.co/0yy1IZwOZb
I agree. As a Senator, I take holding this administration accountable very seriously. I believe @SecNielsen has lost the credibility to lead DHS, and that she needs to step down.
‚ÄúI expect to be held accountable‚Ä¶‚Äù That‚Äôs what Homeland Security @SecNielsen told Senators during her confirmation hearing in November.
It‚Äôs an honor and a privilege for Minneapolis to be in the running to house the @USArmy‚Äôs new Futures Command. Minneapolis offers tremendous assets and an innovative, entrepreneurial energy that would go above and beyond to support the Army‚Äôs goals. 		https://t.co/DKjOkqRZdu
Minnesota‚Äôs proud tradition of @USArmy service was forged by the First Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the Battle of Gettysburg. Today, thousands of service members in Minnesota uphold that legacy.
Don‚Äôt worry about making an appointment‚Äîthey‚Äôre free and open to all. If you have any questions, feel free to call my office at (651) 221-1016.
Today my staff will be in Wadena at Mahube-Otwa Community Action Partnership (311 Jefferson Street South) from at 2:30 to 4:30 p.m. to work one-on-one with Minnesotans who may need help.
Navigating federal agencies like @DeptVetAffairs, @CMSGov, @USCIS, @SocialSecurity, or the Passport Agency can be overwhelming. That‚Äôs why my office is always here to lend a hand.
Workforce training partnerships help companies find the talent they need, and help Minnesotans develop the skills for jobs without taking on loads of debt. It‚Äôs an idea that works, &amp; it's a win for Minnesota's economy and working families.
The #skillsgap is leaving employers w/ good jobs that they can‚Äôt fill. Today I met w/ folks at @newflyer to discuss efforts needed to help biz find trained workers. I have a bill that would help tackle the #skillsgap by expanding workforce training partnerships btwn schools &amp; biz https://t.co/mXws9KJAXX
The bill also approves $1 billion for the TIGER program‚Äîor what‚Äôs now called BUILD‚Äîand $2.55 billion for Capital Investment Grants, both of which will help communities improve and strengthen the safety and reliability of Minnesota‚Äôs transportation infrastructure.
This bill includes many housing initiatives that I have supported, like HOME, CDBG, and NeighborWorks. This bill sustains past investments in affordable housing‚Äîsomething that‚Äôs sorely needed in Minnesota and across the country.
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm happy to share that the Senate Appropriations Committee recently approved a bipartisan spending bill that provides a whopping $71.4 billion investment toward our nation‚Äôs housing, transportation, and other programs that build our economy.
If we want to get to work on rebuilding our roads and bridges and modernizing our schools, hospitals, and housing, then we need the federal government to make real and meaningful investments.
I am committed to supporting Minnesotans who serve our country, as well as their families, during and after deployment. If you‚Äôre a Minnesota veteran who needs help accessing benefits, feel free to call my St. Paul office at (651) 221-1016.
This year marks 153rd Anniversary of the Civil War. At the outbreak of the war, MN was the newest state in the Union &amp; only had a population of about 180k but it was the 1st to volunteer troops. The 52 service members I addressed carry on our state‚Äôs proud tradition of service. https://t.co/hfeDLbACBz
Today in St. Cloud I told 52 service members, who will soon be deployed to Kuwait, and their families how grateful I am for their service and the sacrifices they make for our nation. https://t.co/0IgmtXPzbb
Teachers shouldn‚Äôt unfairly have their grants switch to loans because of minor paperwork errors. https://t.co/Sc54P86mLR
In Minnesota, over 4,800 of these grants‚Äîwhich help students pay for college if they plan to teach in a high-need field, like #STEM, in a low-income school‚Äîwere changed to loans between 2009 and 2016.
Investing in teachers can help ensure that every student has access to a high-quality public education. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm urging @BetsyDevosED to take action to help teachers whose TEACH Grants were unfairly converted to loans. https://t.co/m5UEvscLDQ)
I‚Äôm a proud sponsor of @SenFeinstein‚Äôs Keep Families Together Act because no child should have to face the terror of being unnecessarily ripped away from their family. #FamiliesBelongTogether
As many Muslims in Minnesota and around the world celebrate completing a month of fasting and reflecting, I wish you and your loved ones Eid Mubarak.
Congrats to @CoachPhill on being promoted to Director of Coaching at USA Curling! @usacurl, you picked the best curling coach out there‚Äîand a pretty good Minnesota Congressional Delegation Hotdish Competition judge, too. https://t.co/Nvkd9Q5p9I
And I introduced The HELP Separated Children Act to protect children when their parents are caught up in immigration enforcement actions with commonsense measures. We have to stop cruelty from becoming a hallmark of our immigration policy. https://t.co/VJnKcKy4Cm
Yesterday I joined @amprog to discuss the harmful effects of family separation, and what I‚Äôm doing to address it. I am a proud cosponsor of @SenFeinstein's Keep Families Together Act, which would outlaw the inhumane practice of unnecessarily separating families at the border.
The Trump Administration‚Äôs separation of children from families at the border is absolutely horrifying. Whether this happens at the border or during immigration raids, separating kids from their parents is cruel.
I recently talked with the MN mom who had to live through this. Her son, Alec, passed away last year. We need to immediately address the unforgiving prescription drug price hikes that led to Alec‚Äôs death, and that are hurting too many other Minnesotans. https://t.co/Gzq5JNfJ4O
Sounds unimaginable, right? But this happened in Minnesota and happens to families across the country who are left making impossible choices between their medications and other basic needs.
But he‚Äôs struggling to afford his medications: the $1,300 prescription drug refill he needs to treat his type 1 diabetes is out of reach. In order to make ends meet, he begins rationing his medication and one month later he‚Äôs dead because he didn‚Äôt have enough insulin.
Imagine this. Your 26-year-old son is out on his own and doing great. He‚Äôs employed, has a place of his own, and a whole lifetime ahead of him.
Minnesota‚Äôs home to beautiful parks, and we‚Äôve got a new coin to prove it! Glad my staff attended the unveiling of a @usmint quarter that celebrates Voyageurs National Park (@VoyageursNPA) today in International Falls. https://t.co/AHns82ZBpK
Sat down w/ folks from MN Grain &amp; Feed Assoc. to talk all things #MNAg‚Äîincl. efforts I fought for on behalf of Minnesotans in the bipartisan #Farmbill. I‚Äôm going to push hard to get this bill signed into law because our farmers, communities, &amp; rural businesses are counting on it. https://t.co/5eaCGVg8qV
Just met Christine, who used to live in MN &amp; who survived the horrific tragedy at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. Thanks, Christine, for demanding action on gun violence. We must pass into law reforms to keep guns away from dangerous ppl &amp; prevent mass shootings https://t.co/KUCnXXvPOT
I always enjoy listening to students share what‚Äôs on their minds. Glad I got to chat about #NetNeutrality and renewable energy with Minnesota high school students visiting Washington with the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (@NRECANews). https://t.co/FhCjq8TTOS
That‚Äôs outrageous. I plan to keep making a full-court press on protecting people‚Äôs pensions. We must ensure that retirees in Minnesota‚Äîand across the country‚Äîdon‚Äôt have the rug pulled out from under them. https://t.co/l71KdkQrPP
In today‚Äôs bipartisan select committee on the pensions crisis, a family business owner told me how the ripple effect will extend far beyond employees if we let pension plans fail. She‚Äôs right. This crisis could hurt families, take down businesses, and depress entire communities. https://t.co/IQEWSxhgae
Today I helped get the 2018 #FarmBill over a major hurdle by helping pass it out of the Senate Ag committee, and I‚Äôm pleased to share that this bill includes many of the provisions that I fought for on behalf of Minnesotans. https://t.co/VfyvSe8sfV
Just had a great visit with students from Farmington‚Äôs Dodge and Boeckman Middle Schools. Appreciated their thoughtful questions about education and health care, and their enthusiasm for our nation‚Äôs capitol. Enjoy the rest of your visit, @district192! https://t.co/MdOSY5VanZ
My staff heard about the negative impact of low commodity prices on dairy farmers‚Äô bottom lines. It‚Äôs a problem too many Minnesotans are facing, and the reason why I fought to get a measure in the #FarmBill to improve the dairy safety net. https://t.co/QQWvwQqpSJ
The bipartisan #FarmBill may have passed out of committee today, but that doesn‚Äôt mean the ag meetings stop. Today I had my staff attend @MNFarmersUnion‚Äôs rural dairy discussion in Mazeppa.
Thanks to all the Minnesotans who met w/ my staff &amp; me to discuss the #FarmBill‚Äîfrom farmers &amp; ranchers to nutrition experts, energy efficiency leaders, &amp; rural dev. folks. Your input helped me get key efforts that matter to #MNAg included in the bill. Watch my opening remarks: https://t.co/HfhnTfblRw
We‚Äôre one step closer to passing a bipartisan #FarmBill‚Äîwould be a big win for Minnesota. Today the Senate Ag committee met to hammer out the details of the bill, and we voted the bill out of committee. Next stop, a vote in the full Senate. https://t.co/EHwozR9nZk
That‚Äôs why I am committed to taking on big pharma‚Äîand the big money behind them‚Äîto prevent companies from price gouging patients because this hurts Minnesota families. https://t.co/UnKAsyNHTX
The drug industry has rigged the system to maximize their profits and they have spent staggering amounts on lobbying in the process‚Äîhundreds of millions of dollars‚Äîjust since the start of this administration.
After the President released his Rx drug plan, pharma stocks shot up. You don‚Äôt need an MBA to know stock prices ‚Üë when investors think profits are going to rise. This isn't surprising given a former industry lobbyist was 1 of the lead White House staffers negotiating the plan.
Earlier today I questioned @SecAzar, Secretary of @HHSGov, about what I see as the Trump Administration‚Äôs inadequate plan to address skyrocketing drug prices. It doesn‚Äôt do enough lower drug prices and rein in pharma company profits.
Drug companies have been driving up prices, and Minnesotans are paying too much for their prescriptions. Everywhere I go, I hear from families who are stuck choosing between their medications and other things they need. That is wrong and I am here to fight back. https://t.co/PFfH9bwiu7
Super PACs and other dark money organizations spent some $1.4 billion in the 2016 election. That is profoundly troubling. I‚Äôm taking to the Senate floor to talk about why I‚Äôm fighting to reform our campaign finance system. Watch live: https://t.co/yJzlgfF3KS
These are just 3 of the many stops my statewide Constituent Services Tour is making, because I want to help as many people as I can. Services are open to the public‚Äîno appointment necessary. For more information, please feel free to call my office at 651-221-1016.
TODAY my staff will be in Plymouth at Missions Inc. (3409 E. Medicine Lake Road) from 3 to 5 p.m. On Wednesday, they‚Äôll be in Duluth at my office (515 W. 1st St Suite 104) from 3 to 5 p.m. On Thursday, they‚Äôll be in Grand Marais at Cook County Courthouse (411 W. 2nd Street).
Plymouth, Duluth, and Grand Marais‚Äîthose are the places I‚Äôm sending my staff over the next three days to meet one-on-one with residents who need help working with federal agencies like @DeptVetAffairs, @CMSGov, @USCIS, @SocialSecurity, or the Passport Agency.
Two years ago today, 49 lives were senselessly taken by a heinous act of violence at Pulse nightclub in Orlando. We must #HonorThemWithAction by working to dismantle anti-LGBTQ violence, hatred, and discrimination, and by finally addressing gun violence.
Today @SenWarren and I called on @SecAzar to address our concerns about the admin‚Äôs inadequate proposal. The high prices of prescription drugs are hurting countless Minnesotans, and this crisis deserves an honest, problem-solving response.	 	https://t.co/VXHTyuiqeh
The Trump Administration‚Äôs plan does not go far enough to help Americans struggling with high drug costs, thanks to the role that former drug industry employees/ lobbyists reportedly played in the crafting of the plan.
In his campaign, @POTUS made bold promises about reducing drug prices. But @SenWarren and I are gravely concerned that the public has been misled, that his drug pricing proposal released last month breaks those promises, and would do little to reduce out-of-pocket drug costs.
Wishing a very happy birthday to @MooreMaya! As a @minnesotalynx fan (yep‚ÄîI‚Äôm a season tix holder), it was an honor to meet you last week in Washington to celebrate your team‚Äôs 2017 @WNBA championship win. You are a true leader and an inspiration, both on and off the court. https://t.co/0LKrdnrPps
I‚Äôm grateful for the input that these folks‚Äîand all MNs‚Äîhave shared with me regarding #FarmBill priorities. I plan to be a fierce advocate for MN farmers, ranchers, rural development leaders, energy efficiency folks, and nutrition experts during the markup of the #FarmBill.
Today I asked my staff to update these Minnesotans, including folks from @MNFarmersUnion, @MNFarmBureau, @YoungFarmers, @mnmilk, @HungerSolutions, and @MinnesotaDHS, on the bipartisan #FarmBill proposal.
I created a #FarmBill working group‚Äîcomprised of Minnesotans with a deep understanding of farm policy and how it impacts our state‚Äîto advise me on things like crop insurance, research, conversation and energy, and to help me push for #MNAg priorities in the #FarmBill.
#NetNeutrality allows the internet to be a pillar of innovation and opportunity that fuels Minnesota‚Äôs economy. It‚Äôs woven into the fabric of our internet, and it should remain that way. Join me in the fight. Keep making your voices heard to help #SaveTheInternet.
I‚Äôve pressed @SpeakerRyan to schedule a vote, and will continue to do so, because a free and open internet is necessary for families, students, and businesses to thrive.
We‚Äôve already made real progress in protecting a free and open internet in the Senate by passing a historic bipartisan resolution to overturn @FCC‚Äôs #NetNeutrality repeal. Now, the House needs to do the same.
I‚Äôm deeply disappointed by the @FCC‚Äôs repeal of #NetNeutrality, which goes into effect today. 		But I have a message for the @FCC: we‚Äôre not backing down. The fight to #SaveTheInternet will continue.
I'm a proud supporter of the #PaycheckFairnessAct, which would help address this persistent problem, and I will keep fighting tooth and nail to help bring equal pay to women in Minnesota and nationwide.
On this date 55 years ago, the #EqualPayAct was signed into law, affirming that all women are entitled to equal pay for equal work. But today, too many women still face pay inequities and discrimination.
And I sit on the bipartisan select committee on the pensions crisis, where I'm working to find solutions so Minnesota retirees, like the ones I met today, don't have the rug pulled out from under them. https://t.co/5WgRVzhxwz
Today I joined Save Our Pensions and @Teamsters120 in Blaine to give them an update on my work in Washington. I'm a cosponsor of @SenSherrodBrown's Butch Lewis Act, which would provide loans to troubled pension funds like Central States. https://t.co/IQrcyb3AiU
It's outrageous and flat-out wrong that more than 22,000 Central States retirees in Minnesota, and numerous Minnesotans in other underfunded pension plans, could face a significant loss if the multiemployer pension system is allowed to fail.
I believe that after years of work, Minnesotans who paid into a pension deserve to retire with peace of mind that their retirement is secure.
I fought hard for a spot on the Senate Ag Committee because I know how important agriculture is to our state. Know that I plan to be a fierce advocate for Minnesota priorities in the Farm Bill debate, and that I'm going to work hard to get this done. https://t.co/HYhG6iAdYf
I want to thank the dozens &amp; dozens of Minnesotans who met w/ my staff &amp; me to discuss the #FarmBill‚Äîfrom farmers &amp; ranchers to nutrition experts, energy efficiency folks, &amp; rural development leaders. Your input helped me get key efforts that matter to #MNAg included in the bill.
Beyond that, it will support conservation efforts, provide funding for ag research, and expand resources for our beginning and organic farmers.
Just as importantly, it will help feed thousands of Minnesota families and school children, expand the production and use of renewable energy, bolster rural economic development, build out broadband to rural communities and guide our state‚Äôs important forestry industry.
The #FarmBill touches the lives of virtually every American and is critically important to Minnesota‚Äôs economy. This bill will not only lead our farmers, ranchers and rural communities into the future, but also sustain tens of thousands of jobs across our state.
Minnesota, I have some good news to share with you‚Äînext week we‚Äôll be taking up a bipartisan Farm Bill proposal in the Senate Ag Committee. This is a big win for our state. https://t.co/hJ62ilCPBD
But as a @mnwild fan, I'm already looking forward to next year. You know, "first-ever #StanleyCup Championship" sounds pretty good to me. https://t.co/Ch9crP8tLz
I also want to pay tribute to the @GoldenKnights' amazing and unprecedented run to the finals in the team's very first year. The exciting final series, and the @Capitals victory, capped off another great season.
From the #StateOfHockey, I send my heartiest congratulations to the @Capitals, who won their first-ever #StanleyCup Championship last night. They did so in impressive fashion with a 4 to 3 win over the Vegas Golden Knights. https://t.co/wIgjFhfzS7
I joined several other senators in pressing President Trump to stop his Administration‚Äôs inhumane policy of separating children from their parents at the border. No child should have to endure such trauma.       https://t.co/Hk3Our6COB
His foster mom told @nytimes, ‚Äúfor two days, he didn‚Äôt shower, he didn‚Äôt change his clothes. I literally had to peel the socks off his feet. They were so old and smelly,‚Äù‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI realized that he didn‚Äôt want anyone to take anything away from him." 		That is deeply unsettling.
The @nytimes shares the story of Jose, a 5-year-old boy from Honduras who was separated from his father at the United States border in El Paso.  Jose cried himself to sleep  for nights after being separated from his father.
We have to stop cruelty from becoming a hallmark of our immigration policy. https://t.co/VuvAJ0cVT9
The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) is intended to increase domestic biofuel consumption in the U.S. I will stand strong against any attempt to count ethanol exports towards the RFS. @EPAScottPruitt‚Äôs plan is a terrible attempt to weaken policy that would hurt Minnesota farmers.
But the fight isn‚Äôt over. To #SaveTheInternet, @SpeakerRyan must schedule a vote on the measure to overturn the @FCC‚Äôs #NetNeutrality repeal. Today I joined @SenateDems in demanding that he do so. https://t.co/SrGxqKgnec
A free and open internet is necessary for families, students, and businesses to thrive. That‚Äôs why last month I joined many of my colleagues in helping pass a historic bipartisan resolution to protect #NetNeutrality.
Like many Minnesotans, I am a huge fan of our state parks and trails‚Äîsome of the best in the country. Congrats to @mndnr on their completion of a campground at Lake Vermillion-Soudan Underground Mine State Park. Glad my staff was able to attend today's dedication. https://t.co/bw14VQnDfx
Groundbreaking. Iconic. And Minnesotan! Remembering Prince today on what would have been his 60th birthday. https://t.co/KSKWYZYSMW
I‚Äôm so glad I got the chance to help celebrate at Payne Elementary, and thanks for your leadership both on and off of the court. And that jersey you gave me? It‚Äôs already hanging outside my office. https://t.co/ymSkGAQMd1
The @minnesotalynx are the definition of strength and teamwork. Last year, they won their fourth (!) @WNBA Championship in the last 7 years. And today, they took part in a day of service in Washington. https://t.co/B3twb0Iz3X
As I said in my first Senate floor speech yesterday, great things can happen when we have women in leadership roles. Take a look at how @RhodaMhiripiriR, Superintendent of Hopkins Public Schools (@Hopkins270) is making history in Minnesota. https://t.co/RaxAKwHacN
These programs represent only a small fraction of the bill‚Äôs costs, but generate large returns‚Äîmore than $5 billion since their introduction. If we‚Äôre serious about helping out our ag communities‚Äîwhich we should be‚Äîthen we need to prioritize the energy section of the #FarmBill.
And this week, I led a bipartisan group of Ag committee members to call on Senate Ag Committee Chairman @SenPatRoberts and Ranking Member @SenStabenow to ensure improvements and strong funding for programs in the energy section of the #FarmBill. 	https://t.co/0VVZicpHEK
That‚Äôs why I introduced a legislative roadmap for the energy section of the #FarmBill that would help ag communities in Minnesota deploy these technologies. My bill would help strengthen programs that have already seen success, like REAP. https://t.co/nPjgbTHkli
I believe a strong 2018 #FarmBill should include opportunities for #MNAg to invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency, which can help Minnesota farmers, producers, ag businesses, and rural business cut costs, create jobs, and strengthen communities.
Every Wednesday when the Senate is in session, I host a coffee for Minnesotans visiting Washington. I want to make sure we have enough coffee on hand for #CoffeeWithTina, so please RSVP if you‚Äôre planning on joining me: https://t.co/jI8XzehGMg
Spending time with Minnesotans and hearing them share their stories over a cup of coffee is a great start to the day. Thanks to everyone who joined me today for good conversation and coffee from Chickadee Coffee Roasters in @DetroitLakesMN. https://t.co/L68ej5zrBP
#ICYMI: I recently sent my monthly newsletter to keep in touch with Minnesotans and let them know what I‚Äôm up to.

When we have more women at the table‚Äîwe all benefit. That‚Äôs what I told @Morning_Joe when talking about my first Senate floor speech this morning. https://t.co/JNMtLcNrN1 https://t.co/WGdicc6oGD
I‚Äôll be there! Can‚Äôt wait to see you and the rest of the @minnesotalynx. https://t.co/4TmEDCpqVP
In just a few minutes, I'll be on @Morning_Joe to talk about my first Senate floor speech and discuss the latest in Washington. Hope you'll tune in on @msnbc.
When women are empowered to contribute, we all benefit. We‚Äôre seeing it more and more here in the Senate. And I‚Äôm proud to be part of that. Watch highlights from my first Senate floor speech here: https://t.co/2wdl3NjOpj
My first Senate floor speech is about the path that got me here, and the contributions women can make when they have the freedom to do so. WATCH: https://t.co/1XsEfvw12Y
My presence here in the Senate will always be seen by some as a symbol of the ‚Äúbroader conversation‚Äù we‚Äôre having about the experience of women in America. And so I thought I might as well go ahead and say my piece about where I hope that conversation goes.
Hope you‚Äôll join me by watching my floor speech‚Äîlive‚Äîhere on my Facebook page at approximately 10:45 AM CT: https://t.co/QfVkeKnrGt
Tomorrow I‚Äôm delivering my first speech on the Senate floor to talk about the path that got me here, and some of the injustices that hold women back‚Äîmany of which start with the policy that gets made right here in DC.
The fact is that a lot of problems have endured because women haven‚Äôt been at the table here in Washington.
I was the 51st woman to take the oath of office as a United States Senator‚Äîbut we‚Äôve had 50 different men just named Charles. And nearly half of all the women who have ever served in the United States Senate are serving right now.
Unacceptable. What we‚Äôre seeing happen at the border is awful, and we need to protect all children. https://t.co/2Z1hKjlj5n
And in the meantime, you can read this month‚Äôs newsletter here: https://t.co/JiGtVZS0D4
What am I working on in Washington? Sign up for my newsletter and you‚Äôll get a rundown on some my latest work straight to your inbox. Just email newsletter@smith.senate.gov and I‚Äôll make sure you get on the list.
Today I led a bipartisan call to extend the enrollment period (which is set to end tomorrow) for the Margin Protection Program (MPP)‚Äîa vital program for Minnesota dairy farmers. More here: https://t.co/xWqcRmhsK4

RT @TheGoodAcreMN: "How can we better connect local food to the ag economy? We need to push for more diversity so we don't have food desert‚Ä¶
Thanks, @MNFarmersUnion, for contributing to today‚Äôs discussion on locally grown food at @TheGoodAcreMN. https://t.co/q0ECwAt9DX
Thank you for hosting, @TheGoodAcreMN, and for your commitment to helping Minnesota farmers and Minnesota‚Äôs food system. https://t.co/oWit7b70Tg
Thanks to everyone who joined me today to talk #MNAg. I‚Äôm going to fight to support our local and regional food systems across Minnesota in the 2018 federal #FarmBill debate. https://t.co/UQ7h2ZHAH7
I got the chance to tour @TheGoodAcreMN‚Äôs kitchen and couldn‚Äôt resist sampling fresh kimchi made from locally grown ingredients. A lot of the food made in this kitchen goes to Minnesota farmers‚Äô markets and coops. https://t.co/LFxLcvNMkw
MN consumers are driving a growing demand for locally grown food &amp; that demand is creating jobs &amp; economic development across the state. Today at @TheGoodAcreMN I met w/ MNs involved in local &amp; regional food systems to discuss this trend &amp; hear their priorities for the #FarmBill. https://t.co/SSM2JMvmbe
And more recently I introduced a bill that requires pharmaceutical companies to reveal how they‚Äôre using the billions of dollars in tax breaks they received as a result of the recently passed Republican tax bill.
For example, my first bill would help prevent big pharmaceutical companies from keeping affordable generic drugs out of the hands of Minnesota families and seniors.
I‚Äôm working to bring down prescription drug prices and hold large pharmaceuticals accountable for jacking up prices at the expense of patients, like Lija‚Äôs daughter.
Her story is alarming, but not unique. It was among those I heard today during a meeting I held w/ medical experts, researchers, &amp; families in MN to discuss skyrocketing Rx drug prices. Her experience is just 1 example of the ways Americans are being hurt by high Rx drug prices. https://t.co/vUYSSYX1BB
Today a woman named Lija showed me several insulin pens that she bought for her daughter in countries around the world. Prices varied from $8 to $18. The exact same insulin pen cost her $140 in the US, even though it was made by the same manufacturer. https://t.co/DbbeELmnd4
Families are struggling to afford the prescription drugs they need. https://t.co/5n0iVTKCx9
I always say that Minnesota is home to some incredible colleges and universities, but today I don‚Äôt have to. This news speaks for itself. https://t.co/bK3F9kIpWd
For Las Vegas Knights: @nateschmidt29 (St. Cloud). For Washington Capitals: @TJOshie77 (Warroad), Matt Niskanen (Virginia), @shane_gersich9 (Chaska), and @TBoyd93 (Hopkins).  Thanks for representin‚Äô. #StanleyCup
They don‚Äôt call Minnesota the #StateOfHockey for nothing. The #StanleyCup Finals started last night, and once again players from Minnesota are on the rosters of the two finalists.
I‚Äôm leading a bipartisan bill w/ @SenDougJones &amp; @SenatorRounds to create a rural health liaison at @USDA who'd be responsible for advocating for rural health across the federal govt, &amp; ensuring agencies work together to tackle health care challenges.https://t.co/xNehSf2uWm
For example, there‚Äôs a @USDA program that can help rural areas build &amp; expand health care facilities. If we had someone making sure USDA &amp; @HHSGov coordinate on these efforts, we‚Äôd have a better pulse on the needs of communities &amp; a better sense of how agencies can collaborate.
The US Department of Agriculture is a strong advocate for rural communities in Minnesota and across the country, and I think there‚Äôs a greater role for the @USDA to play in improving health care in rural Minnesota.
When I meet with farmers, businesses, and communities in rural Minnesota, health care is a top priority‚Äîthey feel like the federal government should be doing more to help people in rural areas get the care they need. And I agree.
Workforce training partnerships help companies find the talent they need, and help Minnesotans develop the skills for jobs that are available right now without taking on loads of debt. It‚Äôs an idea that works, &amp; it's a win for Minnesota's workforce, economy, and working families.
‚ÄúEvery year more Minnesota companies have said that the labor shortage is their No. 1 issue‚Äù, writes @duluthnews. 	 	I have a bill that would help tackle this problem by expanding workforce training partnerships between schools and local businesses. 	https://t.co/L8izG6lARj
It's so exciting to see #robotics growing in Minnesota. Congratulations to the small-town alliance of Greenbush Middle River (@GMRRobotics), Frazee-Vergas, and Eden Valley-Watkins on winning the @MSHSL robotics championship! 	https://t.co/x9oFUgdCuJ
That‚Äôs why restoring buildings in the Upper Post at Fort Snelling to create affordable housing for veterans is such a great idea. This historic place has so much resonance for Minnesota, and could be a big help for some of our veterans. 	https://t.co/RpFfNeYW7S
When I travel across the state to talk with veterans, housing almost always comes up. Minnesota veterans need more affordable housing options.
Yes, hero is right. Great to have Minnesotans like you, Everett, in our state. https://t.co/4sugDC84iU
I‚Äôm committed to helping Minnesota‚Äôs veterans get the benefits and care they‚Äôve earned, like access to health care and mental health services. So please know that you can always turn to my office for any kind of assistance. I‚Äôm here to work for you.‚Äã https://t.co/r0LPZe7aPT
On #MemorialDay, I think about my father-in-law Mark Smith who served in World War II. I think about the sacrifice he made when he was just a young man, and all of the young people now who step in at a time when they are just starting their lives‚Äîand just how much we owe them.
This year was particularly special at Fort Snelling because it was the first time in 35 years that a flag was planted at each one of the markers, and I want to thank the more than 5,000 volunteers who made that happen as a tribute to our veterans.
One of our most solemn duties is to take care of the men and women who serve in our armed forces. Today I joined veterans, service members, and their families at Fort Snelling National Cemetery and the Minneapolis Veterans Home to honor our country‚Äôs fallen troops. #MemorialDay https://t.co/4GHbavCOyV
I‚Äôm leading the effort to help kids who are being separated from their moms and dads who are facing arrest, detention, and removal actions. I introduced the HELP Separated Children Act this week because we need to fight for these children and their families. https://t.co/ssMk1gqQo6
I hope we can get this bill passed into law, because it‚Äôs what‚Äôs best for children and families. https://t.co/bakoxTMgMo
The HELP Separated Children Act steps up efforts to keep vulnerable children safe with commonsense measures, like allowing parents to make calls to arrange for the care of their children and ensuring that children can call and visit their parents while they are detained.
Since I first heard kids were being cruelly ripped from their parents in this way, I committed to protecting children whose families are swept up in immigration enforcement. I‚Äôve introduced legislation that makes good on my promise, but more than that, it‚Äôs the right thing to do.
Children shouldn't be suddenly abandoned at home or at school without information on their parents‚Äô whereabouts, but we‚Äôre seeing that happen to kids with moms and dads facing arrest, detention, and removal actions.
After hearing from farmers and ranchers about the real concerns of livestock haulers, I helped introduce a bipartisan bill that keeps animals‚Äô wellbeing in mind and is good for haulers in Minnesota and across the country. Learn more here: https://t.co/LkzKqcDdCP
We support our livestock producers, and we also need to make sure we‚Äôre extending that same support to the men and women who are making sure their products are able to get to market.
Wishing a very Happy Birthday to @SenAmyKlobuchar, an incredible colleague and friend. https://t.co/HktzlKTKKO
The Rural Health Liaison Act would create a position to make sure there's coordination between the Ag Department (@USDA) and other federal agencies, especially the Department of Health and Human Services (@HHSGov). I'll be pushing to get this including in the upcoming #FarmBill.
When you work with someone, you communicate with them so you're both on the same page, cover all the bases, and get stuff done. The same concept goes for the bipartisan legislation I helped introduce with @SenDougJones and @SenatorRounds this week, the Rural Health Liaision Act.
That‚Äôs what I, @PPFA , @Guttmacher, and @PattyMurray are talking about on today‚Äôs call to discuss Trump Administration‚Äôs move to change the #TitleX family planning program.
The new proposed rule to restrict #TitleX family planning funding is an affront to women. It‚Äôs as if our President and VP want to be in the doctor‚Äôs office whispering over the shoulders of health care providers about what they can and can‚Äôt tell women about reproductive care.
Land of 10,000+ lakes, and land of two of the best park systems in the nation. 		Big congrats to @CityMinneapolis and @CityofSaintPaul‚Äôs park systems (@MplsParkBoard &amp; @CityofSPP) for ranking no. 1 &amp; 2 on @tpl_org's 2018 #ParkScore Index. #OnlyInMN.  https://t.co/YAcYTDDOlh
That‚Äôs why I intro‚Äôd a bipartisan bill w/ @SenToddYoung to improve public health preparedness by ensuring fed agencies advance this approach. I‚Äôm glad that key aspects of our bill are reflected in legislation that passed out of the Senate Health Committee today. https://t.co/uAKllWocTI
A One Health approach‚Äîthe idea that human and animal health are linked, and that both are affected by changes to our environment‚Äîcan help us prevent and respond to outbreaks like this.
Minnesota was hit hard by the avian flu outbreak a few years back. It hurt the ag economy and had significant human health implications.
Glad to meet with local leaders from Sherburne County and @StearnsCountyMN to discuss regional priorities, from #broadband and transit needs to human trafficking. Thanks for making your voices heard in Washington. https://t.co/TDoQFnGCO6
Highway 23 is a critical thoroughfare for much of greater Minnesota. By upgrading and investing in our infrastructure, we can support economic growth and address clear safety issues affecting our communities. https://t.co/7FBB8dV73X
And this afternoon, I spoke with some Minnesota @steelworkers about their priorities and what we can do together to protect and strengthen the rights of workers in Minnesota and across the nation. https://t.co/gpACV4Z0gG
Today I rallied in solidarity with @steelworkers to protect workers‚Äô rights. United Steelworkers helped build the middle class in our country, and these hardworking Americans deserve a fair wage, safe working conditions, retirement security, and basic respect and dignity. https://t.co/o3MN77TO7X

EMS providers do everything they can to help us &amp; we should do the same in return. My office recently hosted an EMS listening session in Virginia, MN to hear abt barriers rural EMS providers face. As co-chair of Senate Rural Health Caucus, I‚Äôm committed to supporting their work. https://t.co/vsHmlo8Zcy
Grateful for our state‚Äôs Emergency Medical Services (EMS) providers‚Äîbrave and dedicated individuals who work around the clock to respond to emergencies across Minnesota. #EMSWeek

A new proposed reproductive health rule is an affront to women. Family planning is key to women‚Äôs economic opportunity, &amp; I trust women &amp; families to make their own decisions about their reproductive health care. More on Trump Admin move to change Title X https://t.co/yvlnyKhtN1
Proud to work with you and @SenatorRounds on this initiative, @SenDougJones. I believe that the Rural Health Liaison Act could make a real difference in helping improve access to health care in rural Minnesota and rural areas across the country. https://t.co/vbLB84EPiw
As a leader of the Senate Rural Health Caucus, I‚Äôm proud to intro a bipartisan bill with @SenatorJones and @SenatorRounds to better coordinate rural health resources across the federal govt &amp; improve health care delivery for rural areas. https://t.co/mM18cQVkxS
When I meet with farmers &amp; rural business &amp; community leaders, the first issue that comes up is health care. And I think the @USDA &amp; @HHS, together, can do more to help rural communities take on health care challenges &amp; make sure that every family can access the care they need.
It‚Äôs unfair to treat people like this. Minor administrative mistakes like missing a paperwork deadline should not yield catastrophic financial nightmares for our teachers and make them worry about their futures as they tirelessly work to prepare our kids for their lives.
But I‚Äôm deeply concerned by recent news that these TEACH Grants are being converted into loans‚Äîwith back interest due‚Äîoften times because of what sound like minor errors in paperwork. https://t.co/VGcE655cBe
Federal TEACH Grants help students pay for college if they plan to become a teacher in a high-need field, like science or math, in a low-income school. Objectively, this sounds great.
Every student should have access to a high quality public education, and investing in our teachers early on can help make this happen. 	https://t.co/gJYhPmC5v5
That‚Äôs why I open my office to talk with Minnesotans over a cup of coffee every Wednesday when the Senate is in session. This week I‚Äôm serving @Stumbeano‚Äôs Coffee from Fergus Falls. If you‚Äôre going to be in town, please join me. RSVP here: https://t.co/jI8XzehGMg https://t.co/7mU3pJh9RH
Being Lt. Governor was like being invited into Minnesotans‚Äô living rooms. My office might not be as cozy as a living room, but I want make sure that you get a big Minnesota welcome when visiting our nation‚Äôs capital. https://t.co/M4RRW5G3gA
I‚Äôm committed to supporting all MNs who serve our country while in uniform and after they come home. I recently sent my staff to meet w/ women veterans in the greater Rochester area to hear about specific issues that they face, and to explain how I can advocate on their behalf. https://t.co/oLkIxMfMw7
This is part of taking my office on the road across Minnesota &amp; explaining how I can help cut through red tape when Minnesotans need help with a federal agency. Services are free &amp; open to all MN residents, no appointment needed. Feel free to call (651) 221-1016 with questions.
TODAY: My staff will be in Virginia at City Hall (327 1st Street South) from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. to meet one-on-one with locals who need help working with federal agencies like @DeptVetAffairs, @CMSGov, @USCIS, @SocialSecurity, or the Passport Agency.
My friend and former colleague, @GovMarkDayton, is committed to helping working families and upholding the progressive legacy of Minnesotans like late Senator Paul Wellstone. Congrats, Mark, on receiving @steelworkers‚Äô Senator Paul D. Wellstone Award today.
That‚Äôs why I intro‚Äôd the SOIL Stewardship Act, which would help MN farmers create &amp; maintain plans to improve soil &amp; water quality on their farms. @RepTimWalz has intro'd the companion House bill, &amp; I‚Äôm ready to get this commonsense bill passed into law. https://t.co/ClephcGfXL
When it comes to conservation, we need to help make sure our farmers have the opportunity to start these efforts, and to keep them going long into the future to protect the environment and sustain their farms. #MNAg
Every time I walk into the Senate Agriculture Committee, I think about the priorities Minnesotans have shared with me and what we need to focus on for a good, bipartisan Farm Bill‚Äîthings like rural development and strong farm programs like crop insurance and conservation support.
Happy birthday to Al Franken, a progressive champion I‚Äôm proud to call my friend.
That‚Äôs wrong, and this Supreme Court decision is dangerous to working people everywhere‚ÄîCongress needs to step in because we need to safeguard Americans‚Äô access to the courts. https://t.co/5fcVDNVVUa
The ability of every American to have their day in court is a core American value. But in order to avoid being held accountable when workers face exploitation or harassment, or when consumers are taken advantage of, corporate interests have embraced the use of forced arbitration.
The point of having a minimum wage is that it keeps up with the cost of living in this country. That hasn‚Äôt happened. https://t.co/rgDjY68kkH
The federal minimum wage hasn‚Äôt been raised in a nearly a decade. Taking into account inflation, the federal minimum wage is actually worth less than what it was worth 50 years ago. And prices for everything from milk to prescriptions has skyrocketed.
One of the proudest things I did as part of the Dayton Admin was help raise the minimum wage in the state, which hadn‚Äôt been raised in 9 years. Now, I‚Äôm proud to back a bill to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2024, which was intro‚Äôd by @SenSanders &amp; @PattyMurray.
A discussion on college affordability should include college students. 		Grateful for the input @StudentsUnited shared with me on how I can help tackle this issue. We need to do more to make college affordable. https://t.co/Ajmb0aiBC0
Thank you, @LeadMNPresISAAC, for participating in my roundtable on college affordability. It was great to talk to students at 2 and 4-year colleges about how we can make college more affordable for students across Minnesota. https://t.co/4WoRRUpsMA
My bill would require Rx companies to fully disclose how they‚Äôre using the tax breaks. I hope that this will give us a foundation of information to help us determine what we can do to lower drug costs for Minnesota families. https://t.co/SO22XcmPUr
#ICYMI: I introduced a bill to hold Rx companies accountable because high Rx prices are hurting Minnesotans. The GOP tax law gave Rx companies a windfall that could help ‚Üì Rx costs. But how much of that $ is actually being used to ‚Üì costs and how much is going to CEOs?
Supporting a diverse and growing farming industry is good for families and good for our economy, and that‚Äôs exactly what the Assist Socially Disadvantaged and Veteran Farmers and Ranchers Act aims to do. Thanks, Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe. #MNAg https://t.co/YXpaPbGDvI
As a member of the Senate Rural Health Caucus, it‚Äôs great to see @usdaRD helping rural communities in Minnesota make sure families can get the health care they need.
Take Renville County Hospital, which received @USDA Rural Development $ to help build a new facility and install telehealth equipment to provide 24/7 physician access. 		https://t.co/ibV7cktedQ
I‚Äôm always proud to share the innovative work Minnesotans are doing to help people in rural areas overcome the unique challenges they face when it comes to accessing quality health care.
Another devastating school shooting. No community should have to endure this. Still learning the facts. Thoughts are with everyone in Santa Fe, TX. We must find the conviction to finally address gun violence.
Glad my staff heard Tracy &amp; Trisha, co-founders of Little Eagles Childcare Center, discuss their work to bring more child care services to the greater Rochester area at @CEDAUSA‚Äôs meeting. I‚Äôm gathering input on MN‚Äôs child care shortage so I can address it in a meaningful way. https://t.co/FHlNq6u2AA
In April I met a Minnesotan who said that she and her husband are spending 27% of their income on child care for one child. That‚Äôs absurd. Minnesota needs more affordable and quality child care options for working families.
I stand with my colleagues in the Minnesota delegation who voted against efforts in the House to weaken our state‚Äôs sugar industry yesterday and I‚Äôll keep fighting for our Minnesota sugar beet farmers in the Senate. Supporting #MNAg should always have bipartisan support.
We need to do all we can to tackle Rx drug prices, &amp; part of this is knowing just how many dollars are going into the pockets of investors &amp; shareholders rather than consumers, &amp; what action‚Äîif any‚Äîpharmaceutical companies are taking to lower drug prices. https://t.co/IOjCWZfVPA
Today, I‚Äôve introduced a bill to help hold pharmaceutical companies accountable. https://t.co/SO22XcmPUr
Skyrocketing prescription drug prices are hurting MN families‚Äîjust last night, I spoke with a MN mom who lost her son bc he was rationing his life-saving insulin. This is wrong, and it comes at a time when pharmaceutical companies are taking in staggering profits.
Ahead of yesterday‚Äôs historic vote to protect #netneutrality, I spoke about why a free and open internet isn‚Äôt just nice, it‚Äôs necessary for families, students, and businesses to thrive. Keep sharing your stories about why we all need a free &amp; open internet. https://t.co/gR5AbaWbnO
This is unacceptable. I‚Äôm calling for an investigation of the payments Novartis made to Pres. Trump &amp; I‚Äôm asking leaders of the Senate Health Committee to hold a hearing w/ the CEO of Novartis as the key witness. We all deserve more answers. https://t.co/aCz4qDTAS1 https://t.co/vZnZZG2TKu
These payments raise concerns that Novartis entered into a financial relationship w/ the President‚Äôs personal attorney in order to not only win over the new Admin, but also prevent the Admin from meaningfully tackling skyrocketing prescription drug prices.
And last week, Novartis confirmed that it paid nearly $1.2 million to Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump‚Äôs personal lawyer, through a shell corporation, Essential Consultants.
Novartis is a giant pharmaceutical company that generates billions in profits. 		Nine of its widely-used drugs alone generate more than $1 billion in sales, and some of the company‚Äôs products come with eye-popping, six-figure price tags.		https://t.co/V56H2retjA
The head of the CIA must reflect our country‚Äôs moral values‚Äîincl. respect for human rights. Haspel‚Äôs involvement in America‚Äôs torture program‚Äîa shameful chapter in US history‚Äîdemonstrates alarming judgment. Haspel shouldn‚Äôt lead the CIA w/ this dark part of history on her record.
Last week I joined anti-torture groups (including The Center for Victims of Torture, which is headquartered in Minnesota), faith leaders, and members of Congress to explain why Gina Haspel should not lead the CIA. https://t.co/fvwaOOU95a
#RamadanMubarak to all who are observing. Wishing you a blessed and peaceful month.
Today we took a big step forward in protecting a free and open internet. My full statement on the Senate #NetNeutrality vote: https://t.co/48Jbo4qgSG
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm backing a bipartisan bill to help small businesses access facilities at national labs. The cost of investing in necessary but pricey equipment needs often holds small biz back. This bill will help spur innovation &amp; help MN small biz thrive. https://t.co/V2vyOZDHYy
And as former small business owner myself, I want to make it possible for more small businesses in Minnesota and across the country to access the resources they need to ensure their businesses create good jobs, grow the economy, and help them and their families thrive.
From the Post-it Note to the Pacemaker. Minnesota has a long history of innovation. When I host roundtables and meetings across the state, I‚Äôm struck by the many ways Minnesotans are developing innovative products to address important issues.
We just reached a major milestone in the Senate to protect #NetNeutrality, but the fight isn‚Äôt over. Millions of Americans fought to establish net neutrality protections, and we need you to help keep them in place. Keep making your voices heard to help #SaveTheInternet. https://t.co/9fPGubtSzn
During #NationalPoliceWeek we recognize our law enforcement officers and honor those who have lost their lives in the line of duty. Glad I got the chance to thank some of Elk River‚Äôs officers for their work today, and thanks to all officers who serve Minnesota. https://t.co/QZ8EHwTs2P
Great news for the #StateOfHockey: Minnesota‚Äîwith its wealth of talented women players‚Äînow has a professional women‚Äôs hockey team! Looking forward to catching a game, @WhitecapsHockey. https://t.co/N4Kt15Qtbs
Today‚Äôs vote for #netneutrality in the Senate is a vote for more freedom and more opportunity for Americans to survive‚Äîand thrive. https://t.co/ITgTcztgG1
3 MILLION. That‚Äôs the estimated # of visits Minnesotans made to food shelves last year, &amp; we know that many people still lack access to food. I told Rabbi Kravitz of @theAdath &amp; @MAZONusa that I‚Äôll be fighting proposed cuts to programs in #FarmBill that help feed Americans. https://t.co/ZixqSzkxCl
And thank you, @IBMRochMN, for recognizing the importance of workforce skills. I intro‚Äôd a bill to help MNs develop the skills they need‚Äîwithout taking on loads of debt‚Äîby expanding workforce training partnerships. It's an idea that works, and we should get it passed into law. https://t.co/18KxP7fXX8
Instituting strong and enforceable standards could stop serious injuries and save lives in across the country. https://t.co/QmI83aI1xr
Given that more than half of the 17 million new vehicles sold in the United States each year have keyless ignition systems, I‚Äôm pressing the NHTSA to move quickly to establish safety standards for vehicles with these systems to ensure meaningful consumer protections. https://t.co/IeKVGW4KLX
That‚Äôs why today‚Äîafter a recent news report detailed how ppl are being seriously injured or dying as a result of exposure to exhaust from vehicles with a keyless ignition‚ÄîI‚Äôm urging @NHTSAgov for action to protect families from these preventable accidents. https://t.co/Ubhxvb1dR3
I want to help keep Americans safe. So when I see the need to make sure safety measures keep pace with tech advancements, I‚Äôm ready to get to work.
Millions of Americans‚Äô retirement security depends on the work of the PBGC. We need someone there who knows what they‚Äôre doing. Trump‚Äôs nominee to head the PBGC has zero apparent expertise on pensions. https://t.co/YZzvRi5yTc
I‚Äôm fed up, too. I‚Äôm working to address the high price of Rx drugs in Washington and have a bill that would help ‚Üì Rx costs by tackling an anti-competitive loophole. But there‚Äôs still much more to do.  https://t.co/KAWdTe95KI
This is wrong, and Minnesota families are fed up. Last weekend at the State Capitol, folks rallied to call for lower insulin prices in response to Alec‚Äôs death. https://t.co/Ff1xocCJzV
The amount of $$$ that Minnesotans are paying for their medications is unsustainable‚Äîand it‚Äôs costing lives. In Minnesota, we lost a young man named Alec because he couldn‚Äôt afford insulin to treat his diabetes. https://t.co/5V4fosfanK
Here‚Äôs what I had to say in a hearing today on health care‚Äîwhich is something that I‚Äôve said many times since I got to the Senate: too many families can‚Äôt afford the high price of their Rx drugs. https://t.co/CSX7Z5wyOX
Thanks to those who traveled to Washington with @alsassociation to discuss how we can help people affected by ALS and support research toward finding a cure. https://t.co/AhVof2BBXo
In my previous job, I traveled across the state to meet with Minnesotans. That‚Äôs still a big part of what I do now, but now I get to meet with them in Washington too. https://t.co/HDg4ZccU2q
As a member of the Senate Education Committee, I‚Äôm working to protect our students because that‚Äôs exactly who I should be fighting for, rather than for-profit schools.
I stand with students. The Department of Education should too, but this seems like quite the opposite. https://t.co/3zGxyBbMkP
Thank you, @HennepinTech, for the opportunity to help celebrate your graduating class of intelligent, compassionate, and inspiring students. Congratulations, and good luck, Class of 2018! https://t.co/lHQwMPOLF4
Minnesotans get it: clean energy can help save $$$ at the gas pump, and help cut greenhouse gas emissions. Would love to take a ride on one of @DuluthTransit‚Äôs new electric buses the next time I‚Äôm there! https://t.co/35XjYnvKrk
Minnesota‚Äôs small businesses create jobs, drive innovation, and make significant contributions to our economy. Congratulations to all of @SBAgov‚Äôs MN 2018 Small Business Winners, including Brenda Nolby, Small Business Person of The Year. https://t.co/Iy3uNwazNW
I firmly believe that Gina Haspel should not lead the CIA with this dark part of our history on her record, and I will be voting against her nomination for director of the CIA. https://t.co/aARW7lMFnl
With the vote on Gina Haspel‚Äôs nomination, we should speak clearly that we oppose torture, that the excesses of the detention &amp; interrogation program do not reflect our values, &amp; we will never allow this brutal activity to be the law or the practice of our country.
Gina Haspel‚Äôs record of having been involved in America‚Äôs torture program‚Äîand involved in the destruction of tapes that provided evidence of this dark period‚Äîdemonstrates profoundly troubling judgment.
Last week I joined anti-torture groups (including @cvt_staff, which is headquartered in MN), faith leaders, and fellow members of Congress to outline why Gina Haspel should not lead the CIA. https://t.co/deJVsLcbz2 https://t.co/zOehJiNDdS
We can work on behalf of moms in MN &amp; across the country by continuing to fight for them. Let‚Äôs keep advocating for equal pay for women, and paid family leave so moms aren‚Äôt forced to go without a paycheck when they take time off for a new kid or a sick family member. #MothersDay
Rural communities face unique challenges when it comes to accessing quality health care, but it also means that ppl have to come up with some pretty innovative ways to address them. Was glad to join fellow leader of the Senate Rural Health Caucus @SenatorHeitkamp in Breckenridge. https://t.co/N3iErtLgju
Thanks to all who joined me and @SenatorHeitkamp in Fargo today to share how you‚Äôre affected by the multiemployer pension crisis. We‚Äôll take your stories back to Washington, and workers, retirees, and businesses can also send suggestions and ideas to JSCSMPP@finance.senate.gov. https://t.co/jZdsvSkhDV
I fought for a seat on a bipartisan Senate panel w/ @SenatorHeitkamp committed to finding solutions bc there are 22,000+ Minnesotans‚Äî&amp; thousands more in North Dakota‚Äîwhose retirement will be at risk if Central States Pension Fund &amp; other similar pension plans are allowed to fail.
There are Minnesotans and North Dakotans who have worked years and who were counting on the pension funds they paid into being there for them in their retirement. Is pulling the rug out from under them the message we want to send to our kids and grandkids? https://t.co/21WfFDtg8G
I heard from a man in Fargo today during a pensions meeting with @SenatorHeitkamp who went back to work in the oil fields at age 73 because he couldn‚Äôt rely on his full pension being there for him. Imagine being that man and having to explain that to your grandkids. https://t.co/MdPIPWRGgT
We need him to deliver on the promises he made to families across the nation, namely allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, and to take action now. My full statement on President Trump's address focused on prescription drug prices: https://t.co/qki8C2T41N
So while I‚Äôm glad that President Trump supports a commonsense measure to cut drug costs, he needs to do much more. The President‚Äôs plan doesn‚Äôt do enough to hold drug companies accountable and falls short of all that‚Äôs needed to provide needed relief to Minnesota families.
Today, the President said we need to bring down prescription drug prices and address "pay-for-delay"‚Äîthe Big Pharma tactic that keeps affordable generic drugs out of the hands of Americans‚Äîand that‚Äôs exactly what the first bill I introduced in the Senate aims to do.
‚ÄúCommencement‚Äù is a funny word. In the graduation context, it represents the long-awaited last step in a long journey. But the word ‚Äúcommencement‚Äù also means ‚Äúbeginning.‚Äù And the question is: The beginning of what? My full speech to @HennepinTech here: https://t.co/sN1VghfIUD
Class of 2018 at @HennepinTech‚ÄîI‚Äôm honored to be your commencement speaker. Congratulations‚Äîno matter what path you took to graduation, and no matter where your journey takes you from here, today is a day to celebrate. Livestream: https://t.co/zwoqB464ch
MN is where I raised my kids &amp; where I started my own business. It's where I realized I wanted a job focused on talking to people about their lives, listening, &amp; then going to work to make things better. Happy Birthday, MN. Glad to call you home, &amp; you don't look a day over 130.
From one woman who supports #netneutrality to another, thank you. https://t.co/eGMEPrFWwv
#TBT to one of our first photos as a family of 4! Archie and I may look bright-eyed and bushy-tailed but it‚Äôs probably just a facade‚Äîa newborn baby means little sleep. Raising our family in Minnesota was the best decision we could‚Äôve made. https://t.co/OajrpIDfAB
A new #FarmBill is right around the corner, and I want to gather input from as many farmers, ranchers, and ag businesses as I can. Thanks to the Minnesotans who shared their priorities with my team in Cloquet yesterday and Worthington today. https://t.co/xWadThNN7R https://t.co/l8agqGzJU4
Glad to see the @FCC cracking down on these robocall and spoofing operations. I‚Äôm going to be looking at more options to take on these spam callers. https://t.co/3JiOhqc1Ud
Last month alone we had 3.4 BILLION robocalls in our country. It‚Äôs clear we need to be doing much more to make sure our laws are appropriately protecting consumers.
You ever get spam calls from numbers that appear local‚Äîor even more confusing‚Äîlook nearly identical to your own phone number? You‚Äôre not alone. This is called ‚Äúneighbor spoofing‚Äù and it‚Äôs getting worse and worse.
#ICYMI: The bipartisan bill I introduced with Senator @lisamurkowski to expand access to mental health services for young people is one step closer to becoming law. The House companion was introduced this week. Great to see my colleagues supporting this commonsense measure. https://t.co/oiqKJg0ynk
I want to do everything I can to support MN farmers, especially given the tough farm economy that‚Äôs taken a toll on too many. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm backing the bipartisan Hemp Farming Act, which would create new opportunity for our farmers by allowing them to grow &amp; sell a new product.
These visits helped me write a bill that reflects both the needs of and successes pioneered by Minnesota, and I‚Äôm going to push to get this commonsense bill passed into law. https://t.co/EIS5cTJXlU
Over the past few months, I‚Äôve been traveling all around MN to gather input on local workforce needs. I‚Äôve seen models that excel, visited communities that have found success, and I‚Äôve seen places that could benefit from more resources and support. https://t.co/joXMlGOHZA
My bill, called the 21st Century Workforce Partnerships Act, would expand workforce training partnerships between secondary schools, community and technical colleges, and local businesses. It‚Äôs an idea that works.
Not everyone wants or needs to go to a four-year college. But everyone should be able to find a good-paying career. That‚Äôs why I introduced a bill to help Minnesotans develop the skills they need for jobs that are available right now‚Äîwithout taking on huge amounts of debt.
Her story is just one example of the many ways #NetNeutrality helps advance our state. We‚Äôre getting closer to the vote to protect net neutrality, and we‚Äôre not backing down. Join me in this fight. Make your voices heard before it‚Äôs too late. https://t.co/rAGme3OI7V
#NetNeutrality puts her small business on a level-playing field with big businesses all across the country. She told me that without it they‚Äôd be wiped out. She'd have no chance of competing.
It allows the internet to be a pillar of innovation that powers Minnesota's modern economy. Just last week I met a Minnesota woman who told me how important #NetNeutrality is to running small business. https://t.co/Nr8O5gwyI5
#NetNeutrality means that some big corporation doesn't get to decide what we see online, how fast we get to see it, based on how much you‚Äôre willing to pay.
The Senate is in the homestretch of the fight to save #NetNeutrality. Today I joined my Democratic Senate colleagues in filing a petition to force a vote to restore #NetNeutrality protections.
Today I‚Äôm joining The Center For Victims of Torture (@cvt_staff)‚Äîan anti-torture group headquarted in Minnesota‚Äîto say why Gina Haspel should not lead the CIA. Watch live: https://t.co/deJVsLcbz2
Thanks to the parents, child care providers, and advocates who shared their ideas with my team in Bemidji yesterday. https://t.co/yBBJFFzFPL
I‚Äôm traveling across Minnesota to gather input on how we can tackle this problem. And when I‚Äôm in Washington, I‚Äôve asked my staff in the state to continue this outreach.
There‚Äôs a growing child care shortage in Minnesota. I‚Äôve talked to families in greater Minnesota who have to drive 50 miles‚Äî50 miles!‚Äîto drop off their kids. That‚Äôs ridiculous. Minnesota families need affordable, quality child care that‚Äôs close to home.
Some people play basketball, some people coach basketball. But both at the same time? Incredible. Happy Birthday @Lindsay_13, head coach of @GophersWBB team and point guard for the @MinnesotaLynx. Can‚Äôt wait to watch you play this Saturday! 	https://t.co/yIiaqRQmtX
President Trump was wrong to pull out of the Iran Nuclear Agreement. Read my full statement here: https://t.co/WzegNMWz3b
So @SecretaryCarson, I‚Äôm hoping you‚Äôll reconsider your plan and instead work to improve access to affordable, stable housing. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs best for Minnesotans and best for the country. https://t.co/SguUwsR0uf
.@SecretaryCarson: you should scrap your proposal to impose new restrictions on housing subsidies. Low-income Minnesotans sometimes need help making ends meet to pay for housing‚Äîincluding seniors, people with disabilities, veterans, and children. I‚Äôm glad you agree, @duluthnews. https://t.co/rWEF9XEnem
In fact the entire island lost power during a recent visit by our Minnesota Twins. That‚Äôs unreal. So today I told a top Department of Energy official that Americans in Puerto Rico deserve better, and they deserve it now. Take a look: https://t.co/fj09ic9KEQ
These are U.S. citizens we‚Äôre talking about. And what we wouldn‚Äôt accept for MNs, we shouldn‚Äôt accept for Puerto Ricans. While many Puerto Ricans have finally had their electricity restored, the grid remains fragile and has been hit by wide-scale power outages in recent months.
Would families and communities still be dealing with severe power outages, unstable living conditions, and widespread blackouts nine months after having their lives upended? I doubt it.
When I think about what we saw happen in Puerto Rico with Hurricane Maria, I can‚Äôt help but think what the response would look like if a comparable disaster struck Minnesota.
I‚Äôm so grateful for these teachers, and for all teachers across Minnesota who are shaping our students into curious, compassionate, and smart leaders. So today‚Äîon #TeacherAppreciationDay‚ÄîI want to say thank you. #ThankATeacher https://t.co/y8HwfYEyll
And in high school my chemistry teacher didn‚Äôt give up on me when I struggled to grasp the material. I knew that he believed in my potential, so when it was time to apply for college, I asked him to write my letter of recommendation.
Ms. Larkin, my first grade teacher, taught me how much fun learning can be. She taught me about style, too: she drove a robin‚Äôs egg blue Volkswagen bug. In junior high I had an English teacher who taught me that reading is a great adventure. I still believe this to be true.
Here‚Äôs a photo from junior high. Growing up I was lucky to have some great teachers who made a real impact on my life, and who I still remember to this day. https://t.co/CdCvAcXnhd
In the US, we do our best to bring our fallen service members home. I‚Äôm glad that we can recognize and honor Quentin Gifford of Mankato‚Äîa WWII sailor killed at Pearl Harbor whose remains were recently identified‚Äîand welcome him back to Minnesota. https://t.co/Li0q9gIjCa
That‚Äôs why I introduced a bipartisan bill to improve public health preparedness by recognizing the connection between human, environmental, and animal health. https://t.co/NZ3KjDkFBr
A ‚ÄúOne Health‚Äù approach‚Äîthe idea that human health is connected to the health of the environment and animals‚Äîcan help us prevent and respond to pressing health issues, like the worsening allergy season that is affecting many Minnesotans right now. https://t.co/qeksoYih0h
I want to help more folks have opportunities like this. That's why I intro'd a legislative roadmap for the energy section of the #FarmBill, which would help MNs develop energy efficient and renewable energy projects by strengthening what works for our farm communities‚Äîincl. REAP. https://t.co/nJb3qtdj8l
I‚Äôm thrilled that Minnesota farmers in Carver and Pope counties have been awarded REAP funding to lower energy costs and boost renewable energy on their farms.
When we can help Minnesota farmers, producers, ag businesses and rural areas invest in renewable energy, cut costs, and create jobs‚Äîthat‚Äôs a win. And that‚Äôs exactly what the @USDA Rural Energy for America Program (#REAP) does.
RT @Jacob_Frey: A strong Farm Bill benefits rural AND urban communities. @SenTinaSmith gets that. Glad to have her in our corner on the Ag.‚Ä¶
And thank you, @2harvest, for your commitment to helping Minnesota families have enough to eat. Your work is critical to supporting the well-being of thousands of Minnesotans, and I‚Äôm going to fight to protect programs that help prevent hunger in the upcoming #FarmBill debate. https://t.co/Fld0sE5GjU
T-minus two days till @SenateDems file a petition to force a vote on restoring #NetNeutrality protections. And guess what: we‚Äôre one Senator away from winning that vote. My colleagues @AmyKlobuchar &amp; @SenMarkey are ready to #SaveTheInternet. Are you? https://t.co/OIdAuTSydh
Congratulations to the 2018 Minnesota Teacher of the Year‚ÄîKelly Holstine‚Äîan English teacher at Tokata Learning Center. I love Kelly‚Äôs motto: ‚Äúevery kid matters‚Äù. Thanks, Kelly, for providing your students with a high quality education, and for inspiring others to do the same. https://t.co/OGOIMz2wj9
This bill would strengthen programs that have already seen success, like the Beginning Farmer &amp; Rancher Development Program, &amp; encourage the development of technology that makes it easier for more farmers &amp; ranchers to bring their products to market. https://t.co/rhFZ1eNVHP
Farming is a way of life for many MN families, &amp; as a member of @SenateAgDems I want to help our next generation of farmers &amp; ranchers, like Abe &amp; Cally, succeed. I‚Äôm backing a bipartisan bill to support new and beginning farmers and ranchers enter and remain in the ag industry.
Meet Abe and Cally Jergenson: two young farmers who grew up on farms in western Minnesota and decided to start their own family farm in Lake Minnewaska in 2014. https://t.co/mEWj4uRPgH
Feel like your allergies are worse this spring? Yeah...you're not wrong. Climate change isn't just an environmental issue, it's a public health issue that's affecting allergies and asthma. https://t.co/aua8OvGh24
Thanks to those who met with me, &amp; for standing up for families in need. W/o your help, food security for MNs could be in jeopardy. Know that I‚Äôll be a fierce advocate for nutrition programs as we move into #FarmBill debate bc that‚Äôs what families deserve. https://t.co/hlWqq4vuZI
I met with SNAP participants, food bank &amp; food shelf leaders, &amp; experts on health &amp; nutrition to discuss the effect of these proposed cuts. Under the President‚Äôs budget plan, MN would need to secure an additional $150 million just to maintain our current nutrition needs. https://t.co/pnJoxGDoCR
I‚Äôm very disappointed that the President wants to make deep cuts toprograms like SNAP, which support millions of Americans below or close to the poverty line‚Äîmost of whom work for low wages, are elderly or disabled, or care for young children.
Last year, Minnesotans made an estimated three million visits to local food shelves, and we know that many families in our state still lack access to nutritious and healthy meals. In fact, in Minnesota, one-in-ten households struggle with hunger. https://t.co/HP3DaBUb9Z
What if you found out that you were at risk of no longer being able to put food on the table for your family? When I think about getting news like that, I know I‚Äôd be scared, and I‚Äôd be frustrated.
Thanks to everyone who shared their input with me today, and know that I'm going to fight for nutrition programs when we start working on the #FarmBill in the Senate. https://t.co/oprSkqjbYb
Food security is important. When Minnesotans have enough to eat, our communities are stronger. Families are healthier, folks can go to work, and kids do better in school. https://t.co/X8uvRD0Pkj
Today at @2harvest I met w/ #SNAP participants, food bank and food shelf leaders, and experts on health and nutrition to discuss the impact of proposed funding cuts to #FarmBill nutrition programs. There‚Äôs clear consensus that these programs are critical to fighting hunger in MN. https://t.co/TB7jBZVkM4
On some reservations, Native women are murdered at a rate of 10 times the national average. This is horrific &amp; completely unacceptable. Today‚Äîon Nat‚Äôl Day of Awareness for Missing &amp; Murdered Indigenous Women &amp; Girls‚Äîwe recommit ourselves to fighting this violence. #NotInvisible
If you have any questions about my Veterans Listening Tour, or if you‚Äôre a Minnesota veteran who needs help accessing benefits, feel free to call my St. Paul office at (651) 221-1016. I want to help as many folks as possible.
I want to make sure veterans across the state know that they can reach out to me when they hit roadblocks in accessing the benefits they earned. I recently dispatched my team to meet w/ folks in Aitkin, Detroit Lakes, &amp; Fergus Falls to discuss VA health care, housing, &amp; jobs. https://t.co/2MhxCrymXN

Her story is inspiring, but it is not unique. It‚Äôs one example of the many ways in which Minnesota's immigrant communities contribute to our state. Their story is not theirs alone‚Äîit is the story of our nation, and it is the story of our state.
This ceremony was especially meaningful to me because a member of my staff was among them. I‚Äôm so proud of Saran, whose own life experiences have led her to work toward a peaceful and more just society. This fall she will begin studying conflict resolution at Harvard. https://t.co/gaAkvI4ZlE
It was a honor to help recognize 40 people who became American citizens today at a naturalization ceremony in St. Paul. Ours is a state of immigrants‚Äîfrom the Scandinavians who made MN their home so many years ago to the Hmong &amp; Somali families who came here more recently. https://t.co/qYt4GSc27T
The CREAATE Act would help provide our country‚Äôs ag community with new export opportunities and create jobs, and I‚Äôm going to fight to see it through.
MAP and FMDP have displayed a return of $28.30 for every dollar invested between 1977 and 2014. Despite these successes, MAP and FDMP funding has not increased since the 2002 Farm Bill, even as competitors increase their efforts.
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm backing the CREAATE Act, which would help expand foreign markets for #mnag by strengthening already successful @USDA export programs, like the Market Access Program (MAP) and the Foreign Market Development Program (FMDP)
I‚Äôm traveling across MN to learn about ag priorities bc I want to advocate for our farmers, ranchers &amp; agribusinesses. I recently hosted #FarmBill mtgs in Austin, Granite Falls, Hutchinson, Lake Crystal, Melrose, Morris &amp; Wabasha. And one issue that came up was access to markets.
#TBT to enjoying a warm spring day with our sons, Sam and Mason, who look like they are ready to leap back into the game. They‚Äôre now grown men (amazingly, I‚Äôm still the same age!); I remember this like it was yesterday. https://t.co/egXw2skNLI
I can‚Äôt wait to take the ideas I got from passionate Minnesotans back with me to Washington D.C. to continue Minnesota‚Äôs legacy as a leader in mental health care.
Today I met w/ parents, community leaders, mental health advocates, &amp; school mental health providers at Washington Technology Magnet High School (@washingtontech) in St. Paul to hear how we can increase early intervention of mental health issues to support MN children &amp; families. https://t.co/AmXNR6EOTR
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm working to expand access to mental health services for young people. I‚Äôve introduced a bipartisan bill to help communities across the country bolster their mental health treatment options for children‚Äîbut that‚Äôs just the start.
Kids struggle with mental health every bit as much as adults, but young people frequently have a hard time accessing mental health care.
I firmly believe that @SecretaryCarson should reconsider this proposal and instead work to improve access to affordable, stable housing for low-income people. https://t.co/h266QPifHR
If enacted, this proposal would leave even more low income people without stable homes, including seniors, people with disabilities, veterans, and children. It would affect 72,400 households in Minnesota, and 4.1 million households nationally.
I‚Äôm urging Secretary of Housing and Urban Development @SecretaryCarson to scrap his proposal to raise rents by imposing new strict requirements on households across the country. https://t.co/1vFZYojcYk
This bill took an important step towards becoming law after passing out of the Senate Health Committee, and I‚Äôm going to urge my colleagues to support this bill in the coming weeks. https://t.co/DVrJZsI314
I‚Äôm proud of what these students have accomplished. Part of helping students succeed means providing greater access to mental health services. That's why I recently intro'd a bipartisan bill w/ @lisamurkowski to expand access to mental health services in schools &amp; communities. https://t.co/6nzrchZjes
While I wasn‚Äôt able to be there in person, I‚Äôm glad I got to virtually connect with the impressive students at REACH‚Äôs conference in Hutchinson. REACH is a program in 30+ schools that helps provide students with the support they need to attain academic and personal success. https://t.co/lWNtMffCgH
Being a fierce advocate for Minnesotans is my top priority. That‚Äôs why my office is traveling across the state to explain how I can help Minnesotans cut through red tape when they need help with a federal agency.
College graduates in MN leave school with an average of approx. 31k in debt. The student debt crisis is a serious issue that needs to be addressed. My office met with @mnprivcolleges to discuss how we can improve college affordability and increase access to higher education. https://t.co/egomnMkKqV

Supporting our family farmers and ranchers, who make great contributions to our economy and help feed the country, shouldn‚Äôt be partisan, and I‚Äôm going to be fighting to get this bill signed into law. https://t.co/92uCN5BtgB
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm backing @SenatorHeitkamp and @SenatorCollins‚Äô bipartisan bill to support new and beginning farmers and ranchers enter and remain in the ag industry. https://t.co/pJFwMvsbPq
The average age of a farmer in Minnesota is 56. As our farming workforce continues to age and we look to the future, it‚Äôs important that we help build the next generation of farmers, ranchers, and ag businesses.
Afterschool programs keep kids safe &amp; improve students' work in the classroom. Pres Trump proposed doing away w/ the 21st Century Community Learning Centers funding, but I'm glad that 37 of my colleagues agree with me: families and kids rely on afterschool and we need to keep it. https://t.co/f2JmBpcSeO
21st Century Learning Centers (known as 21st CCLCs) support afterschool programs in 100+ MN communities. When I stopped by a 21st CCLC in Mpls earlier this year (@BeaconsMPLS), I said that I'd fight for these programs bc I've seen how important they are to students and families.

Great to see Minneapolis joining two other MN cities‚ÄîRochester and St. Louis Park‚Äîin committing to work towards running entirely on renewable energy.  In MN, we know that homegrown, clean, and affordable energy means more jobs and is good for the planet. https://t.co/zmrtQuNuL8
I want to personally thank all of the firefighters and public safety officials who responded to the massive explosion and fire at Husky Energy in Superior. Your hard work prevented what could have been an even bigger disaster. I am proud of your service and dedication. Thank you.
I believe that all workers have the right to a safe workplace. As we honor workers who have been killed or injured on the job, including those in Superior, WI, I believe we must continue to fight for advancing worker safety.  #WorkersMemorialDay
The Trump Administration has proposed closing the lab in Morris, and I‚Äôm fighting back against these efforts because research is so important to Minnesota agriculture.
Yesterday I continued my #FarmBill listening tour at North Central Soil Conservation Research Lab in Morris to gather input from locals on their priorities &amp; needs. Thanks for insightful conversation on the importance of conservation efforts &amp; nutrition programs in the Farm Bill. https://t.co/SUHWAdvdlb
The #FarmBill needs to have strong farm programs‚Äîcrop insurance, safety net programs, conservation‚Äîand good nutrition programs. We also need to make rural development a priority. That‚Äôs what I told @JoeKASMRadio I‚Äôll be focusing on when we start to work on the bill in the Senate. https://t.co/na0UN4ojBX
I look forward to continuing this conversation in Washington, where we only need #OneMoreVote to help restore #NetNeutrality protections that millions of Americans fought to establish. Minnesota‚Äîand the country‚Äîare counting on it.
.@SenMarkey showed us a fast food commercial that explains why #NetNeutrality matters. In it, burgers were served slower than chicken sandwiches unless customers paid a premium. Consumers were outraged. Without net neutrality, this same thing could happen to internet service. https://t.co/HrLPser12i
Today I heard from local businesses, educators, and technology experts about how important a free and open internet is to the future of MN‚Äôs economy, and to our nation‚Äôs future prosperity. Thanks to @SenMarkey of Massachusetts for joining @AmyKlobuchar and me at this roundtable. https://t.co/PlWmGlXnNb
The @FCC‚Äôs move to scrap #NetNeutrality protections earlier this year means that giant corporations can pick how families, schools, and communities use the internet. That‚Äôs unacceptable.
I‚Äôm backing the effort to restore protections for #NetNeutrality‚Äîthe important principle that what we read, view, and watch on the internet is free and open to everyone.
Watching the developing situation at the Husky Refinery in Superior. Hope everyone is staying safe. Good thoughts to the public safety officials who are on the scene.
Look at Mr. Pompeo‚Äôs record. The things he‚Äôs said. His actions. Anti-Muslim, anti-LGBTQ, pro-torture. I registered a strong no vote against him in the Senate today.
An awful choice for Secretary of State. Mike Pompeo should have never been considered for this job, and I‚Äôm gravely concerned with how he will now handle the serious responsibility of being our nation‚Äôs top diplomat.
Thank you, @CUREriver, for sharing your perspective on #FarmBill priorities today. https://t.co/H7taSyWnEO
Thank you, @MNFarmersUnion, for hosting my listening session on Minnesota‚Äôs #FarmBill energy priorities. It‚Äôs important that I gather input from as many folks as possible. https://t.co/OCQAZy09VN
Thanks to everyone who participated in today‚Äôs discussion. Your input will help me be a fierce advocate for Minnesota during the #FarmBill debate.
I introduced a legislative roadmap for the energy section of the next #FarmBill, which would strengthen energy programs that have already seen success, like REAP, to help more farmers, ranchers, and rural businesses invest in renewable energy and energy-efficiency projects.
Energy is an important part of the #FarmBill currently moving through Congress. Today, my staff met with farmers and energy experts at Minnesota Farmers Union in St. Paul to discuss our state‚Äôs energy priorities as we debate this important bill. https://t.co/KggO2AA1aA
She's right. Climate change is one of the biggest threats to our planet‚Äîsomething virtually every scientist in the country agrees on. As a member of the Senate Environment Committee, I‚Äôm fighting day in and day out to protect our planet. https://t.co/G4S9MHW1sO

If Republican leadership refuses to bring this bill to a full Senate vote‚Äîlike @SenateMajLdr has signaled‚Äîit sends a terrible message. Russia attempted to undermine the very fundamentals of our democratic process, and the American public deserves to know why.
Special counsels must be allowed to conduct investigations without fear of political retribution or interference. Glad to see a bill I‚Äôm supporting to help protect Robert Mueller‚Äôs investigation into Trump-Russia has cleared @SenJudiciary. https://t.co/GFlD7Cv4n6
This week I helped the bill pass the Senate Health Committee and get one step closer to becoming law. It‚Äôs great to see my colleagues supporting this commonsense measure to help some of our country's bravest and most selfless Americans.
I‚Äôm proud to back @SenatorMenendez and @LisaMurkowski‚Äôs bipartisan bill to help monitor and study cancer among firefighters. This much-needed bill would bolster prevention and treatment of several major cancers that disproportionately hit firefighters.
Minnesota‚Äôs firefighters put their lives on the line every day to keep our communities safe. The very least we should do in return is do everything in our power to keep them healthy.

College graduates in Minnesota leave school with an average of approx. $31k in debt. And an often forgotten expense is the cost of textbooks. During the 2017-2018 school year, the average student at a 4-year college spent more than $1,000 on books and supplies.
HOTDISH UPDATE: Officially less than 24 hours until the 8th Annual MN Congressional Delegation Hotdish Competition. Other states might say hotdish is just a casserole, but they‚Äôd be wrong. We‚Äôll be live streaming the event on my official Facebook page: https://t.co/HZrEUC3Vo9
Thank you, @SecretarySonny for your response to my letter, which says that you will have your agencies do more tribal outreach, &amp; I‚Äôm glad we could further discuss this today. We need to make sure the @USDA reflects the needs &amp; concerns of Native American producers &amp; growers. https://t.co/XSy4xEjENg
That‚Äôs why earlier this month, I sent a letter to @SecretarySonny to urge him to include tribal representatives in discussions about trade and export markets. Tribes and tribal producers are often not included, and this is a missed opportunity. https://t.co/fHs1QGOQ1g
Btwn 2014 &amp; 2016, the American Indian Foods Int‚Äôl Export Program generated nearly $62 million in sales of native products in overseas markets, incl. wild rice, bison jerky, &amp; teas. This commercial success shows potential for growing export markets for Native American products.
Today I invited @SecretarySonny to visit Minnesota to learn more about this program because I believe it‚Äôs a model for the nation, and would help the @USDA as it works to implement a rural #broadband loan and grant pilot program. https://t.co/6kPEQrPpFQ
MN's Border-to-Border grant program has helped deploy services to nearly 34,000 households, over 5,000 businesses, and 300 community institutions. There‚Äôs a lot of work to be done to expand access to #broadband, but this program is doing a lot to reach the hardest-to-serve areas.

Nutrition programs are integral to the health and well-being of countless Minnesotans, and I‚Äôm going to fight to make sure they‚Äôre included in the 2018 #FarmBill.

I‚Äôve written a bipartisan measure w/ @lisamurkowski (R-AK) to expand access to mental health services in schools &amp; local communities, which will be voted on today as part of a larger bipartisan bill to address the opioid crisis. https://t.co/OIP6xkiFoI
I believe we need to boost access to mental health services, strip away the stigma of mental illness, and make sure that our young people can get the treatment they need as early as possible in their lives.
It‚Äôs going to take an all hands on deck effort if we really want to tackle this crisis. And part of that plan should‚Äîand, in fact, must‚Äîinclude mental health treatment.
The opioid epidemic is a scourge affecting every part of our state and it has no boundaries‚Äîyoung, old, rich, low-income, suburban, rural. Whether you‚Äôre from the smallest township or the biggest metro area, opioids are stealing lives and tearing families apart.
I‚Äôm working on legislation right now to help protect children whose families are swept up in immigration enforcement, and I‚Äôll be revealing the bill in the coming weeks. https://t.co/CXCE4EHizm
I was shocked to learn that, according to a New York Times‚Äô report, hundreds of immigrant children have been separated from their parents over the past year. Whether this happens at the border or during immigration raids, separating kids from their parents is cruel.
No child should have to face the terror and confusion of being ripped away from their family. But young kids‚Äîincluding infants and toddlers‚Äîare often put in that very situation when their parents are caught up in immigration enforcement, detention, and removal actions.

These soaring prices are great for drug companies‚Äô wallets, but they hurt families who are counting on this medication. Local fire, police, health departments, and everyday Minnesotans are unable to afford the drug that could save their life or the life of someone they know.
The price of naloxone‚Äîthe life-saving overdose reversal drug‚Äîhas increased dramatically during the opioid epidemic. Take Evzio, a hand-held auto-injector: it‚Äôs increased in price from $690 in 2014 to more than $4,000 today for a two pack.
42,249. That‚Äôs how many American lives the opioid epidemic claimed in 2016. Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of death for Americans under 50.

.@CFPB issued guidance that warned auto dealers that certain lending practices‚Äîparticularly the practice of ‚Äúdealer markup‚Äù‚Äîcan give cover to discrimination &amp; force ppl of color to pay more for a car than white consumers, which is prohibited under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act
I believe that no one should have to pay a higher interest rate because of their race, ethnicity, or any other protected characteristic.
I join many of my colleagues, civil rights groups, and consumer rights groups in feeling disappointed by today‚Äôs Senate vote that rolls back a critical protection that helps prevent auto lending discrimination.
The head of the EPA should be someone who can effectively‚Äîand ethically‚Äîenforce the laws that protect the air we breathe, the water we drink, and lands we share. Pruitt has abused the public trust, and must step down immediately.

The effect of a pension plan failure goes far beyond retirees. The ripple effect can take down businesses and hurt communities, too.
At least 22k Minnesotans are at risk of losing their pensions. I think it‚Äôs outrageous and it‚Äôs unfair to lose a pension you‚Äôve been promised after years of hard work. I‚Äôm on a bipartisan committee to find a solution, and we‚Äôd like to hear from you. https://t.co/vKNjYGgSVQ

Alert the presses: it‚Äôs hotdish time! Right here, right now, I‚Äôm announcing that the 8th annual Minnesota Congressional Delegation Hotdish Competition is officially scheduled for April 25. To my colleagues, break out your oven mitts, aprons, and tater tots. https://t.co/tKDCuHBiHO
So today, I'm making a second push. I asked the CEO of Sun Country to explain what happened‚ÄîI want to hear directly from the airline. And so do the families who were stranded in a foreign country and left to fend for themselves to get home. https://t.co/tl8m2jCKTy https://t.co/Itxfe8MF1z
I led the charge pressing @USDOT to make sure that our airline cancellation policies prevent this from happening again. But Sun Country stranded its customers, and they have to make things right. https://t.co/f67xlx2Lum
Over the weekend, Sun Country Airlines effectively abandoned hundreds of travelers who were trying to fly back to MN‚Äîsome of whom are still stranded. They‚Äôve had to rebook themselves &amp; spend hundreds, or even thousands, to get home. Immediately, I took a stand for these families.
LIVE NOW: I‚Äôm joining Senate Democrats to talk about how the Republican tax law was rigged to benefit big corporate executives and Wall Street. Tune in to hear me speak. https://t.co/aks8lAfSPw
I had the chance to work with Paul Thissen for many years, and deeply respect his intellect and commitment to justice. I know he will do an outstanding job serving on the Minnesota Supreme Court.
I open my office every Wed at 9 a.m. when the Senate‚Äôs in session to talk with Minnesotans over a cup of coffee from a Minnesota roaster or shop. Tomorrow‚Äôs coffee is from Moxie Java in Moorhead. If you‚Äôre in town, I hope you‚Äôll join me. RSVP: https://t.co/jI8XzehGMg https://t.co/Zk6vbYfspE
As Lt. Governor, I‚Äôd say the job was like being invited into Minnesota's living room. My office might not be as cozy as a living room, but I still like to make sure that Minnesotans get a big welcome when visiting our nation‚Äôs capital. https://t.co/hN3eH74Xh0
Thank you to everyone who attended these meetings and for sharing your stories and input with my staff. If you have any questions about my Veterans Listening Tour, feel free to call my St. Paul office at (651) 221-1016. https://t.co/glpqdoGZLh
I want to help ensure that Minnesota veterans‚Äîand their families‚Äîreceive the benefits they‚Äôve earned. Yesterday my staff met with veterans in Montevideo and Willmar to hear about challenges they face in securing benefits, and to discuss how we can advocate on their behalf. https://t.co/Bc6OqUQHK6
You're the definition of strength and resiliency, @SenJohnMcCain. Archie and I wish you the very best during your recovery. https://t.co/bYHqeQB0vs
I want to hear from our federal transportation officials about what can be done to prevent it from happening again. I‚Äôm asking @USDOT to work with airlines to ensure cancellation policies adequately protect consumers. https://t.co/ZAiGNwYrG0 https://t.co/sPobm4lfVZ
At a time when consumers are already financially squeezed by the airline industry, it is troublesome to see a local airline basically give up on getting its customers home.
Over the weekend, Eagan-based Sun Country Airlines stranded hundreds of travelers in Mexico because of the bad weather, leaving them to rebook on their own and deal with insufficient refunds. Sounds like a cruel joke, but it actually happened. https://t.co/vUMeN0NlQH
Barbara Bush is a woman of great strength. Archie and I wish her‚Äîand her entire family‚Äîcomfort and peace during this difficult time.	https://t.co/SftzIC7eS3
Congratulations, @mnwild, on the big win over the Jets in game 3 of the #StanleyCup playoffs. #StateOfHockey https://t.co/kSZDuil5Vx
#AllEyesNorth: Wishing best of luck to the @Timberwolves, who will play in their first #NBAPlayoffs game in 14 years tonight.
Stay safe out there in the snow, and I'll be rescheduling my @2harvest visit because I'm committed to working with leaders to protect these important nutrition programs.
I planned on heading to Second Harvest Heartland in St. Paul today to talk about how important nutrition programs are to Minnesotans, but like many of you I'm still working to clear out the snow and I don't want to make folks venture out. Thanks to all working to clear the roads!
Read my statement on US airstrikes on Syria here: https://t.co/A7lj6lsTsn
And I‚Äôll have to let Local 49 Training Center know when I‚Äôm back in Hinckley because I want to work the excavator again. https://t.co/Z0Ljo414TI
Loved the tour of Local 49 Training Center, so thanks again Jason. We need to expand apprenticeship programs like Local 49 in Hinckley across Minnesota and our nation. https://t.co/H0mGNXlMmY
When we talk about trade and export markets, we need to make sure we‚Äôre including tribal representatives too. I've reached out to @SecretarySonny w/ @SenJohnHoeven, @SenatorTomUdall &amp; @SteveDaines bc @USDA needs to support the work of tribes &amp; producers in the global marketplace. https://t.co/d0KgGsWkUx
So here we are in Cloquet on our way to Mountain Iron. What Minnesota staple did I have to get while passing through? https://t.co/ekBb3gp33l
I think it‚Äôs a great model for what we should be doing more of nationally. I mean, check this out: students get to work on real world tech projects w/ Best Buy‚Äôs Geek Squad, study topography w/ augmented reality sandboxes, &amp; earn culinary certifications. https://t.co/peXzSKQuYF
I recently visited @BurnsvilleHS's Pathways Program, an innovative program that helps students explore career opportunities in all kinds of different areas, and partners with businesses to make this happen. https://t.co/vp7HOLg5Mr
Job-training partnerships between schools and local businesses are an example of how we can help Minnesota businesses find workers with the skills they need, and help students land good paying jobs without a 4-year degree.
And next week, my staff will be doing more of the same in Montevideo and Willmar, because we want to help as many Minnesota veterans as possible. If you have any questions about my Veterans Listening Tour, feel free to call my St. Paul office at (651) 221-1016.
Yesterday my staff was in Preston, where they met with area veterans and local leaders to talk about how we can connect veterans in the region with services, and advocate on their behalf when they encounter barriers to receiving their benefits. https://t.co/MyCbH38hqv
That‚Äôs why my staff and I are traveling around Minnesota to hear about the challenges veterans face when trying to secure the health care, education, housing, or job placement benefits they‚Äôve earned.
When men and women who have honorably served our nation in uniform return home, we need to make sure they receive the benefits and care they were promised.
Mike Pompeo is an advocate for blowing up the Iran Deal, a torture supporter, has expressed Islamaphobic views, and has an anti-LGBTQ record. He‚Äôs a disastrous choice to be our nation‚Äôs top diplomat. And you can bet I‚Äôll be voting against his nomination to be Secretary of State. https://t.co/Q6lk39iNG7
Rod Carew, Kirby Puckett, and now, Joe Mauer. Congratulations to our hometown hero on joining the 2,000-hit club with the @MNTwins‚Äîthe third #MNTwins player in history to reach this milestone. https://t.co/UhX04mZpYM
I don't. https://t.co/msgIZB522P
Thank you, @SenPatRoberts and @SenStabenow, for committing to a bipartisan #FarmBill. I'm looking forward to working with you on this, and getting it passed into law. Our nation's farmers, ranchers, agribusinesses, and rural communities are counting on it. https://t.co/Cs7BOE4Etc
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm proud to be a cosponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would help put a stop to this inequity. I‚Äôm going to continue fighting to get that important measure passed in the Senate.
But I want to be clear: to the millions of women in this country who should be taking home more than they do right now, the pay gap is a huge problem.
When I wrote about Equal Pay Day earlier this week, I said the 80 cents/$1 stat applies to men and women doing the same job. That last part‚Äîcomparing particular job categories‚Äîwasn‚Äôt quite right. And I‚Äôm glad @PolitiFact reached out to me for clarification.
Tuesday marked Equal Pay Day in the United States‚Äîa day I sure wish we didn‚Äôt have to recognize each year. On average, women in our country earn 80 cents to the dollar compared to men. And that pay gap is even wider for many women of color.
Minnesotan. WNBA @MinnesotaLynx All-star. Olympian. Congrats to @Lindsay_13 on being able to add Head Coach to that list. @Gophersports and @GopherWBB fans: this is exciting news!	https://t.co/uR3RkTW4CS
I have a new bill that builds out broadband to rural communities and modernizes internet speeds‚Äîjust one of many things we need to be doing to address this issue. Check it out: https://t.co/PvlPPCSpiZ
And if we‚Äôre going to build an economy that works for everyone, we need to seriously prioritize high-speed internet. Just like we did with rural electrification and the interstate highway system.
#Broadband is the infrastructure of the 21st Century‚Äîit isn‚Äôt just nice to have, it‚Äôs necessary.
With more than 3,000 pig farms in MN, it‚Äôs important that I stay up to date on #mnpork priorities. Glad I got to sit down w/ @MinnesotaPork producers‚Äî&amp; two student ambassadors‚Äîto discuss #FarmBill priorities &amp; to tell them I‚Äôm advocating for Minnesotans affected by recent tariffs https://t.co/xNQJuvSXjX
Today, on Yom HaShoah, we honor the 6 million innocent lives stolen during the Holocaust, and recommit ourselves to never forgetting the horrors of this atrocity, and standing up against all forms of intolerance and hate. #HolocaustRemembranceDay
Which is why I met with @GrowthEnergy to tell them they have a champion of biofuels in Washington. https://t.co/7F6INNn6gZ
The Renewable Fuel Standard (#RFS) helps make sure our country keeps making clean, homegrown biofuels produced in states like Minnesota. They are better than fossil fuels for our environment. But they are under assault from the Trump admin.
What a game, @Timberwolves! Big congrats on earning a spot in the #NBAPlayoffs for the first time since 2004. #AllEyesNorth	 https://t.co/zgkkziGHXb
This disturbing level of coordination between Russia and the people in the President of the United States‚Äô own inner circle‚Äîand possibly even the president himself‚Äîmust be investigated fully and fairly, without risk of political interference. https://t.co/2Y1SVOiL60
Russia is a hostile foreign govt that interfered in the‚Äô16 presidential election w/ the goal of undermining our democracy. No serious person disputes that fact. On top of that, members of the Trump campaign &amp; Trump admin knew abt Russia‚Äôs meddling &amp; welcomed offers of assistance.
I support the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act‚Äîa newly unveiled bipartisan bill to protect special counsels like Robert Mueller from being fired without good cause‚Äîbecause they should be allowed to conduct investigations without fear of political retribution.
The Secretary of State should be a person who can use diplomacy to build consensus. They need to be able to represent American values to the world. It‚Äôs abundantly clear that Mike Pompeo is not that person.
Today I announced that I plan to vote against Mike Pompeo‚Äôs nomination for Secretary of State. Pompeo is a man who has a record of anti-Muslim statements, some of which he‚Äôs read from the House floor. He‚Äôs a man who referred to waterboarders not as torturers but as ‚Äúpatriots.‚Äù https://t.co/G7sgm0G1VW
We must protect freedom of the press. If you haven‚Äôt already seen this, you should watch it. It‚Äôs what systematic news distortion looks like:  https://t.co/z1wkc7i3hd
I‚Äôve joined my colleagues to call on the @FCC‚Äî which is responsible for ensuring that broadcast licenses serve the public interest‚Äîto investigate Sinclair‚Äôs behavior, &amp; determine if it‚Äôs fit to acquire even more broadcast licenses through the proposed merger w/ Tribune Media Co. https://t.co/8kY9kYafgo
The airwaves belong to the American people. And I‚Äôm incredibly alarmed by news that Sinclair Broadcast Group‚ÄîAmerica‚Äôs largest local TV owner‚Äîforced countless local news anchors to recite the same script in front of their combined millions of viewers. https://t.co/ouZs01vUzZ
This evening: Game 1 of #StanleyCup playoffs for the @mnwild and @Timberwolves play for a ticket to the playoffs for the first time in 15 years. Huge night for Minnesota sports, to say the least.		https://t.co/jOV2ZV6tFz
According to a recent @UMNExt study, the beef industry generates an estimated $4.9 billion of economic activity in MN &amp; supports 47,300 MN jobs. I sat down with @CattlemenMN to discuss the important role cattle ranching plays in supporting our economy, and #FarmBill priorities. https://t.co/KdXFOvRQ5w
Proud to work with you, @SenMarkey, on this important measure to protect our nation‚Äôs strong fuel economy standards. They save consumers $$$ at the pump, cut greenhouse gas emissions, and create jobs. https://t.co/ZxFjCNlxdW
But let me say‚Äîand feel free to let me know if my Northland bias is showing‚ÄîI would argue that Minnesota restaurants could round out the entire list of best spots to eat in the country.
Big congrats to @GrandCafe_MPLS on being named a best restaurant of the year by @foodandwine. A well-deserved honor that follows in the footsteps of @surlybrewing and @spoonandstable. https://t.co/id6CUYbU1E
I open my office to talk with Minnesotans over a cup of coffee every Wednesday at 9 a.m. when the Senate is in session. If you‚Äôre going to be in Washington, I hope you‚Äôll be able to join me. RSVP: https://t.co/jI8XzehGMg
What a great morning! Thanks to the Minnesotans who stopped by my office for coffee and conversation, including folks from @CattlemenMN, @UMNExt, @stcloudstate, and @MN4H. https://t.co/l3SISGGf8u
Let‚Äôs tell @EPAScottPruitt we don‚Äôt want higher prices at the pump and we don‚Äôt want dirtier air. Join me in fighting for this bill. https://t.co/JVHUiN5dH9
Abandoning our national emissions standards, like EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt would like to do, is nothing more than an unabashed attempt to put corporate interests like the big oil and gas companies over what‚Äôs good for our country. It must be stopped.
Today I helped introduce a bill to put the brakes on a Trump Admin effort to roll back our nation‚Äôs strong fuel economy standards. These standards save $$$ at the pump (more than half a billion for MN drivers alone), cut greenhouse gas emissions, and create jobs.
Your privacy is important. Your data is important. And your ability to control both of those things is important. Mark Zuckerberg is being questioned now about Facebook‚Äôs handling of the data misuse scandal that recently came to light. Watch live: https://t.co/9Ek2vGzpmE
Hey spring, c‚Äômon, we‚Äôre ready whenever you are. https://t.co/PN57tQQ2sN
And I‚Äôm glad to see that yesterday the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled that employers cannot justify paying a woman less than a man doing the same work because of her salary history. Because that‚Äôs ridiculous. https://t.co/YCFIAJYiNX.
I‚Äôm a proud cosponsor of @PattyMurray‚Äôs Paycheck Fairness Act, which would help close the long-existing #incomegap between men and women.
It‚Äôs completely unacceptable that, on average, American women only earn 80 cents for every dollar a man earns for doing the same job. And the #paygap is even greater for most women of color. #EqualPayDay https://t.co/ly69NwlqyJ
Thank you, @MNDentalAssn, for your ongoing work to expand access to dental care for Minnesotans, tackle our state's opioid crisis, and make higher education more affordable for students. https://t.co/srUBYg13mZ
TRIO provides students‚Äîincluding nearly 16k in Minnesota‚Äîwith tutoring, counseling, and mentoring to help them prepare for and graduate from college.
That‚Äôs where groups like @MNTrio can help. I‚Äôm pleased to share that I‚Äôve joined the bipartisan TRIO Caucus‚Äîwhich works to expand access to higher education for low-income students, first-generation college students, and students with disabilities.
College affordability is a huge issue for Minnesotans, there‚Äôs no question about that. We often forget, however, that there are lots of different hurdles that many young people have to clear in order to get accepted into, stay enrolled in, and graduate from college.
It‚Äôs a good day when you get to sample stroopwafel at work and learn about successful job-training partnerships between schools and businesses in Minnesota. More here: https://t.co/peXzSKQuYF https://t.co/YQlPxRkV0R
If you‚Äôre going to be in Washington, I hope you‚Äôll be able to join me. If you have any questions, feel free to call my office at (202) 224-5641.
I‚Äôm proud to say that #CoffeeWithTina features coffee from local Minnesota shops and roasters. I picked up beans for this Wednesday‚Äôs gathering at Moxie Java coffee shop in Moorhead. https://t.co/QMG1MSMnfh
Good conversation with Minnesotans over a cup of coffee is one of my favorite ways to start the morning. That‚Äôs why I open my office every Wednesday at 9 a.m. when the senate‚Äôs in session for coffee and conversation with Minnesotans who are visiting our nation‚Äôs capital.
I‚Äôm deeply troubled by the President‚Äôs proposed 65% cut to the EERE budget‚Äîa move that would seriously jeopardize the United States‚Äô standing as a global leader in energy innovation‚Äîand plan to fight this proposal every step of the way.
Not only does EERE improve domestic renewable energy resources like solar and wind, but it saves consumers $$$ at the gas pump and saves businesses and households $$$ on their energy bills.
For the sake of economic competitiveness &amp; improving our energy security, we must continue to invest in renewable energy &amp; efficiency technologies. I plan to help make sure this happens by pushing for adequate funding for the Office of Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy (EERE). https://t.co/QoXwIL9d7V
The win gave head coach Scott Sandelin his second #NCAA title as coach of the Bulldogs. Thanks for such a great season and an exciting tournament. You've made your school, the city of Duluth, and all of Minnesota proud.
.@UMDMensHockey was the only non-Big Ten school in the #FrozenFour, and showed Ohio State, Michigan, and Notre Dame why Minnesota is the #StateOfHockey.
A big congratulations to @UMDMensHockey, who took home the school's second national title by beating Notre Dame 2 to 1 in the #FrozenFour @NCAAIceHockey championship game at the Xcel Center Saturday night. https://t.co/IAl3npZgk2

Expanding rural #broadband is abt making sure Minnesotans are able to connect, compete, &amp; create the lives that they want. Thanks @RegionNineDC for hosting Connect Rural Broadband Summit in Mankato on Thursday. Check out my photo album from the event: https://t.co/hpB6RVcqlJ https://t.co/YArC6G8YZL
Al from Cannon Falls said ‚Äúthe only thing I had going for me was the internet‚Äù when talking about starting his small business. He says he knows a lot of other companies that don‚Äôt have a brick and mortar office but they‚Äôre able to compete because they have access to broadband. https://t.co/XNAGvN7AuM
Meet Al. He‚Äôs a Minnesotan who I met on Thursday at the Connect Rural Broadband Summit hosted by @RegionNineDC in Mankato. During a Q &amp; A session, Al shared that he's a business owner from Cannon Falls who views the internet as the "great equalizer." https://t.co/gancKtk69t
Every day across Minnesota fire fighters put their lives on the line to keep us safe. I‚Äôm saddened to hear of the death of Timothy Royce‚Äîwho passed away in line of duty‚Äîand send my condolences to Timothy‚Äôs family and the Mapleton Fire Department. 	https://t.co/GmjWunsLUD
So cool! https://t.co/nAVOx3d7Za
Thanks for hosting me, @BurnsvilleHS. I was impressed by all of the ways students can explore different careers through your Pathways Program. https://t.co/MlgBHqMsJd
I met some impressive students who are working to earn culinary advanced certifications that will help put them on a path toward a career in the culinary arts, and even got a chance to sample their stroopwafel. Delicious! https://t.co/na7GwNmssl
I visited the Fab Lab, where students demonstrated how they use sand to study topography. As they move the sand around, they can see how it changes a landscape. Pretty cool! https://t.co/ggbMW7APNN
I got a chance to see students working on tech projects at the @GeekSquad desk. This is made possible by a partnership with @BestBuy, and provides students the chance to get real-world troubleshooting experience. https://t.co/IIQUUv5pKF
.@BurnsvilleHS partners w/ businesses to help make the program happen. Job training partnerships btwn schools &amp; local businesses are great‚Äîthey can help businesses find workers w/ the skills they need, &amp; help students land good paying jobs.
Today I visited Burnsville High School (@BurnsvilleHS),‚Äôs Pathways Program, which helps students prepare to be career ready by offering students the opportunity to explore different career pathways that suit their interests.
During the last two weeks, I‚Äôve been meeting with communities that are at the forefront of workforce development to help me ensure that the workforce legislation I introduce reflects both the needs of and successes pioneered by Minnesota.
Thanks for hosting, @MvacAmanda, and thanks for what you do on behalf of the community. I learned a lot about child care challenges in the greater Mankato area, and I‚Äôm ready to get to work to address them. https://t.co/fiTONE0gIr
But that‚Äôs only a start. I plan to keep listening and working to address Minnesota‚Äôs shortage of child care options. For the sake of healthy families and strong workforce, we need to work together to address this issue.
In the Senate, I‚Äôm a cosponsor of @PattyMurray's Child Care for Working Families Act, which would dramatically expand child care &amp; early childhood programs. I also cosponsored legislation that would increase access to on-campus child care for parents who are earning their degree.
I was in Mankato to talk about how these challenges are affecting the region‚Äîand to discuss how we can work together to fix them. 	https://t.co/09cScpSHxb
It‚Äôs plain to see that difficulty accessing safe, affordable child care can impact a family‚Äôs financial stability, and be a barrier for parents who need to work, go to school, or want to be involved in their community.
And yesterday in Mankato, I heard from Sara, who said that she and her husband are spending 27% of their income on child care for one child.
One of my top priorities right now is addressing child care shortages. I‚Äôve heard from parents in Minnesota who have to drive 50 miles to drop off their kids, which takes a real toll on families.
Thank you, @RegionNineDC, for hosting me, and for your work to help expand access to quality, high-speed, and affordable internet across Minnesota. Access to internet isn‚Äôt a nice thing to have, it‚Äôs a necessary thing to have. https://t.co/erNEW17Ein
I will soon introduce a bill to modernize the successful Community Connect program through USDA. This program provides grants for areas where it is not currently feasible for providers to deliver service.
I‚Äôm working on this goal, too. I fought to get real investments for #broadband in the recent government funding bill, and I‚Äôm glad that we were able to secure a new $625 million investment to expedite rural broadband expansion.
It was great to see so many local community partners, business leaders, residents, and stakeholders working to expand access to quality, high-speed, and affordable internet.
Access to #broadband shouldn‚Äôt be a partisan issue. Broadband is an issue of economic opportunity, and we need to make it widely shared. That‚Äôs what I told folks at @RegionNineDC‚Äôs Rural Broadband Summit today in Mankato. https://t.co/gDexxVuyDT
Jurisdictions piloting programs that incorporate health and housing, like Solace Housing Project, don‚Äôt just see an improvement in the health and wellbeing of their communities. They see fewer trips to the emergency room, the homeless shelter, and jail.
Today I met with community members working to create a supportive apartment complex for women leaving the criminal justice system and people whose cases are heard by drug courts in St. Peter. https://t.co/d51OSAIxFm
We need to take a holistic approach to substance abuse‚Äîand that means recognizing the connection between health and housing. Time and time again, we‚Äôve seen that stable housing corresponds with better health outcomes.
Plan on attending my weekly morning coffee for Minnesotans who are visiting Washington? Beans for next week‚Äôs #CoffeewithTina at 9 AM hosted in my office are from Moxie Java in Moorhead. I stopped there yesterday to sit down w/ Mayor @DelRaeWilliams. Thanks Tabitha for saying hi. https://t.co/0nDAxN1xK9
I took a tour of a MN business yesterday that has been able to add more staff &amp; update equipment thanks to a @usdaRD grant. Tami and Kim, you have quite the operation at @carloscreek.

Officer Falconer put his life on the line and risked everything to protect his community. Today‚Äôs ceremony with my colleagues @amyklobuchar and @RepTomEmmer serves as a reminder that heroic acts of bravery like this must not be forgotten. https://t.co/RORRjU0gq7
It was an honor to help recognize the bravery of Officer Jason Falconer today, whose courage in the face of an attack saved the lives of Minnesotans at a shopping mall in St. Cloud. https://t.co/M3GITHYWiS

Today my staff &amp; I traveled to Moorhead to inform residents about how we can help them cut through red tape when they need help with a federal agency.

Did you know the Dilly Bar was invented in Fargo-Moorhead in 1955? The Moorhead @DairyQueen opens every year on March 1 &amp; signifies the start of spring.

That‚Äôs just one of the issues I discussed with leaders from western Minnesota‚Äôs farm, energy, nutrition, and conservation sectors‚Äîas well as local elected officials‚Äîin Moorhead today. https://t.co/73tUalMVML
Crop insurance helps farmers ensure they can survive even if faced with a disastrous season and horrible weather event. And it helps make sure the rest of the country can get food at an affordable price.

Stopping for lunch between meetings is a real treat given that I‚Äôm often on the road. Thanks to Everest Tikka House in Moorhead for a delicious meal. https://t.co/N3noKh7rlR
I‚Äôm grateful for the 15+ educators, business leaders, and workforce development professionals who participated in today‚Äôs conversation. Know that your input will help ensure that the workforce legislation I introduce reflects both the needs of &amp; successes pioneered by Minnesota.
G.L.Tucker, Director of Workforce Development Solutions at @MStateCollege, said, ‚Äúwe are a solutions provider,‚Äù and I couldn‚Äôt agree more. Workforce development programs can help meet the needs of local businesses and support economic growth.
Thanks so much to Dr. Peggy Kennedy, President of @MStateCollege, for opening my roundtable on workforce development in Moorhead today by discussing how workforce development programs are an investment in our communities. https://t.co/peW3H5RbhE
I‚Äôm standing up for the tens of thousands of Minnesotans who are in retirement limbo bc of our pensions crisis by bringing MN‚Äôs perspective to the table in the bipartisan select committee on pensions. I‚Äôm committed to finding actual solutions to address this pensions emergency.
There are more than a hundred multiemployer pension funds like Central States facing a funding shortfall. If they fail, hundreds of thousands of people will lose their pensions, and the ripple effect will hurt many more in our local communities.
‚ÄúThis goes way beyond Central States.‚Äù That's something I heard at my roundtable discussion with labor leaders in Moorhead today. And that's right‚Äîthis pension fight is important because employers make solemn commitments to people, they need to honor them. https://t.co/fTx1PABBmg
In 2011, UMD made the #StateOfHockey proud when they won the College Hockey title with an exciting overtime win in the final #FrozenFour game, and last year they finished second. Let‚Äôs go Bulldogs!
Wishing best of luck to @UMDBulldogs Men‚Äôs Hockey team as they take on Ohio State in the first game of the #FrozenFour at the @XcelEnergyCtr in St. Paul on Thursday.
I really enjoyed sitting down with @ELLEmagazine to talk about my time so far in the Senate, and hope you‚Äôll read the full column here:	https://t.co/NgmuQhVab1
"I was responsible for billions of dollars. One of the reporters looked at me and said, 'So, do you think you'll be able to do this?...And isn't that kind of a classic moment that every woman has had to cope with? I just said, 'I should not be underestimated.‚Äô"
‚ÄúI felt quite prepared to take the task on. Here I have a graduate degree, I ran my own business, I worked at General Mills, I‚Äôve been a lieutenant governor, I‚Äôve been the chief of staff for the governor, which is like COO for the whole state‚Äî34,000 people reported to me."

I urge the @EPA and the rest of the Trump Administration to think about the terrible consequences‚Äîto families‚Äô pocketbooks, to the environment, and to the air that we all share‚Äîif they move forward with this idea. https://t.co/go5gW0XzwN
Not only is this an attack on our climate, U.S. jobs, &amp; national security, but it‚Äôs a sign that Pruitt is unabashedly prioritizing big corporate interests over what‚Äôs best for our country.
But now, in an abandonment of the @EPA‚Äôs chief purpose‚Äîprotecting the environment‚Äî@EPAScottPruitt is considering a plan to roll back these milestones. https://t.co/wLEouVaE3x
In 2012, the U.S. set historic new emissions standards for cars on our roads. This new standard has already created jobs, cut foreign oil dependence, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.
The @EPA is in turmoil and the problem lies in its leadership. We‚Äôve seen the reports by now about EPA Administrator @EPAScottPruitt‚Äôs sweetheart housing deal‚Äîwhich I find very concerning‚Äîbut I‚Äôm also disturbed by the dangerous policies he‚Äôs pushing.

Initiatives like D-J's are really important. We must create more pathways to jobs in all industries‚Äîincluding #STEM‚Äîto help address disparities in the workforce.

TODAY: My office will be lending a hand to Minnesotans needing help working with federal agencies at Mahube-Otwa Community Action in Detroit Lakes (1125 West River Road) 10:45 a.m.-12:45 p.m. and at Mahube-Otwa Community Action in Fergus Falls (128 West Cavour Ave) 2:30-4:30 p.m.
One of each, please! üôãüèº https://t.co/gaOqeQViks
It‚Äôs my job‚Äîand the job of my office‚Äîto help Minnesotans cut through red tape when they need help w/ a federal agency. Don‚Äôt worry about making an appointment‚Äîthey‚Äôre free &amp; open to all. If you have any questions, feel free to call my office at (651) 221-1016.
On Wednesday, my staff will be at East Grand Forks City Hall (600 Demers Ave) from 9-11 a.m., and at my Moorhead Office (819 Center Ave) from 2-4 p.m.
Tomorrow, my staff will be at Mahube-Otwa Community Action in Detroit Lakes (1125 West River Road) from 10:45 a.m. to 12:45 p.m., and at Mahube-Otwa Community Action in Fergus Falls (128 West Cavour Avenue) from 2:30-4:30 p.m to lend a hand.
Hey there, my office is always here to help Minnesotans when it comes to working with federal agencies like @DeptVetAffairs, @CMSGov, @USCIS, @SocialSecurity, or the Passport agency.
Consumers in Minnesota and our country should always come first‚Äîand I‚Äôm going to fight to make sure that there‚Äôs a strong, independent watchdog for them at the CFPB. https://t.co/kD9CAFwAYs
I joined my colleagues to strongly urge the CFPB not to weaken or repeal this critical consumer protection. https://t.co/p4U5eCC7le
But now, I‚Äôm concerned that the #CFPB may be wavering from its core mission. It‚Äôs very disappointing that the Trump administration plans to begin the process of reconsidering‚Äîand eventually weakening or repealing‚Äîits payday lending rule.
Created in response to the 2008 financial meltdown, the @CFPB protects consumers from financial rip offs. Since then, it has helped millions of Americans who have been harmed by unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices

Talking with Minnesotans always leaves me feeling inspired and makes me so proud to represent people across the state. Here‚Äôs more on what I‚Äôve been up to this week: https://t.co/yiE5JCAvM8 https://t.co/y8h2igVTsQ

Minnesota has a long history of innovation. When I host roundtables and meetings across the state, I'm struck by the innovative ways Minnesotans are working to address important issues to better the lives of themselves, their neighbors, and people across the state. https://t.co/f9rqMgMSlI
The Border-to-Border Broadband Development Grant Program in Minnesota is a model for the nation. It provides funds for the expansion of #broadband service to areas of Minnesota that are unserved or underserved. This is a model I am sharing with my colleagues in Washington. https://t.co/0gmXhUHv90
We also stopped at Caydence Records &amp; Coffee (where I somehow resisted getting a donut and got a granola bar instead), Pebmoob Senior Center, Plaza Del Sol, and Arlington Hills Community Center to meet with business owners, customers, &amp; other East Siders. Thanks again @founghawj! https://t.co/sgtiPT2Oya
I picked the right week, because we‚Äôre finally getting some sun in MN &amp; we went for a walking tour of a number of East Side businesses in Saint Paul. Sen. @founghawj and I started at ByMore Supermercado, and then I grabbed a cup of coffee &amp; talked with some Minnesotans at Ward 6. https://t.co/ARBvDgXnaj
I love traveling to every part of Minnesota. After spending my first weekend as U.S. Senator in the Northland, MN State Sen. @founghawj reached out and wanted to make sure I visited East Saint Paul too. So this week we headed over to Payne Avenue. https://t.co/9r0FQ3Ew9Q
And Rosie, Jamie, and Warren are something else‚Äîthey‚Äôre Minnesotans I‚Äôm proud to represent. https://t.co/8stygZVwVp
Warren was homeless for about 5 yrs before coming to the shelter. He‚Äôs now a volunteer in the kitchen at Higher Ground &amp; also recruits for the running club that has changed Rosie‚Äôs life. Rose, Jamie, &amp; Warren are living proof of what happens when we invest in affordable housing. https://t.co/ICeB3bOFQG
And then there‚Äôs Jamie who I met at Higher Ground. Through having stable housing, she‚Äôs been able to complete a culinary arts program. And after that, she went on to get a community health worker certification. Next up? She told me she wants to become a licensed practical nurse. https://t.co/B1UHage2Hv
Rosie shared with me that by having a safe space to live, she now understands the connection between housing and health. Rosie was able to join a running club through the shelter, &amp; she‚Äôs lost 200+ pounds and says she‚Äôs never felt better. She loves the staff at Higher Ground too. https://t.co/mN8Nj2npIi
As you can see, Rosie‚Äôs energy is infectious. And I want to share her story with all of you. https://t.co/1e9XMAiDcV
I want to tell you about Rosie. I met Rosie this week during a stop at Higher Ground in St. Paul, where I was visiting to learn more about the wraparound services‚Äîlike healthcare and job coaching‚Äîprovided at the shelter. https://t.co/u0vd3c1GtD
Hey @FIRSTteam1816 Green Machine, I need an update‚Äîhow is the robotics competition going at Williams?

Some 9 million Americans served during the Vietnam War era. So today, on Vietnam War Veterans Day, we recognize and honor all of them for their service and the sacrifices, and we welcome them home.

Julia (she‚Äôs the one wearing green next to Maria) says she hopes to join the ironworkers union, but she knows she ‚Äúhas a lot of options‚Äù through STEP. I agree, and I was so impressed by what I saw at @AnokaTech. Thanks for empowering MN students and working to address #skillsgap. https://t.co/VBGRhUPFWL
I asked students who are studying welding during a tour of @AnokaTech's STEP program what they say when ppl ask if a job in manufacturing means dangerous or dirty work. These women responded w/ "why would you think that?!" They know they have safe, good-paying jobs ahead of them. https://t.co/K6K9Nx6gpP
That‚Äôs why my staff and I are traveling across the state talking about this important legislation. Today my staff attended a Farmers Union Rural Voices meeting in Oronoco to hear about and discuss the region's rural ag needs. https://t.co/qp7l2UVNMO
As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I will be a fierce advocate for Minnesota priorities during the 2018 #FarmBill debate.
My bill would help #mnag deploy more renewable energy by strengthening energy programs that have already seen success in the current Farm Bill, including the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP), the biorefinery loan guarantee program, &amp; the Biomass Crop Assistance Program.
I want to help continue this growth with the legislative roadmap I introduced for the energy section of the next #farmbill, which is being written into Congress this year. https://t.co/nPjgbTHkli
In fact, Minnesota created the second largest number of solar jobs‚Äîcompared to all other states‚Äîfrom 2016 to 2017. https://t.co/NYV3CmubSc

Thanks, Nikki, for sharing your story at this week‚Äôs discussion on the high price of prescription drugs. I‚Äôm going to fight to lower Rx prices because the amount of $$$ that many Minnesotans pay for their medications is out of control. https://t.co/km8760VaFZ
That‚Äôs right! Job-training partnerships between schools and local businesses, like STEP, are great. They‚Äôre an example of how we can help MN businesses find workers with the skills they need, &amp; help students land good paying jobs without a 4-year degree or loads of college debt. https://t.co/fg5F5wTl1L
Thank you, @dunwoodycollege, for hosting this important discussion on how we can create pathways for women in all areas of the workforce‚Äîincluding #STEM‚Äîand make sure they receive fair pay and benefits, too. https://t.co/jdHO4haZWy

My staff also traveled to Rochester to meet w/ local leaders &amp; innovative child care providers at Families First. Thanks to everyone who shared input w/ my staff‚Äîknow that it will help me find real ways to help create more affordable, quality child care options for MN families. https://t.co/sWx36sQyFW
This morning my staff traveled to Harmony to learn about Harmony Kids Learning Center, which was created in response to a shortage of child care in the region. This center is a model of how local businesses can help address the needs of their communities. https://t.co/LW0DSRbR4K
That‚Äôs why in February I began a statewide effort to address MN‚Äôs shortage of affordable, quality child care. My staff and I are traveling across MN to gather input from parents, providers, and advocates on how we can create more options for working families.
Today my staff heard how some Minnesotans spend half their income on child care, and it‚Äôs taking a serious toll on families. We need to address it.
.@FIRSTteam1816, I couldn‚Äôt agree more‚ÄîI‚Äôm a big advocate for after school programs and #STEM, too. Thanks for contributing to today‚Äôs conversation on women in the workforce, and for teaching me a thing or two about robotics! https://t.co/2gVMvm9rFz
Thanks to the students, @FirstTeam1816, educators, advocates, and women who work in #STEM for taking part in today‚Äôs discussion. Your input will help guide the workforce legislation I plan to introduce when I get back to Washington. https://t.co/qFeCHRwX0t
We need to ensure that women receive fair pay and benefits, too. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm a cosponsor of Senator @PattyMurray's Paycheck Fairness Act, which would help close the long-existing income gap via a comprehensive set a measures.
Because if we want to prepare women for the workforce, we need to create pathways for women in all areas of the workforce, including careers in STEM, manufacturing, and construction.
As Lieutenant Governor, I worked to pass the Women‚Äôs Economic Security Act (WESA)‚Äîlegislation that helps prepare women to work in non-traditional careers‚Äîand you can count on me to continue this work in the Senate.
Today, we had 20 MN women from diverse backgrounds gathered around the table to talk workforce development. This is what a roundtable discussion on women in the workforce should look like. Thanks President Rich Wagner and @dunwoodycollege for hosting. https://t.co/ViZhBL8tFI
This is just the beginning of my fight to address prescription drug prices. Too many big pharma companies are putting corporate profits ahead of families, and the amount of $$$ Minnesotans are paying for their medications is out of control. https://t.co/tcHQrcaN7P
My first piece of legislation is aimed at lowering the price of Rx drugs. It would help tackle high prescription drug prices by addressing an anti-competitive loophole that big pharma companies exploit in order to force Americans into buying overpriced drugs.
These soaring prices are great for the bottom lines of drug companies, but they‚Äôre squeezing Minnesotans who are already struggling to pay for the medications they need.
The report also finds that, between 2012 and 2017, the price of 12 of the 20 most commonly prescribed brand-name drugs for seniors jumped by over 50 percent. And during that same time period, sales revenue for those 20 drugs increased by nearly $8.5 billion.
Ten times the rate of inflation. That‚Äôs how much prices for many of the most popular brand-named drugs for seniors have increased by over the last 5 yrs, according to a congressional report issued by my Senate colleague Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) of MO https://t.co/78EvmhmSfM
Thanks, @founghawj, for giving me a walking tour of small businesses in St. Paul, including ByMore Mercado Market, Caydence Records and Coffee, Pebmoob Senior Center, and Plaza Del Sol.

I fought to get real investments for #broadband in the recent government funding bill, and will soon introduce a bill to that provides grants for areas where it is not economically viable to provide service.
In a world of innovation, creativity, and entrepreneurship, Minnesotans need to have access to #broadband. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm working hard to make sure all Minnesotans‚Äîincluding rural, tribal, and low-income communities‚Äîhave access to reliable and affordable broadband.

Today's news that President Trump has decided, effective 3/2019, to terminate Deferred Enforced Departure (DED)‚Äî that‚Äôs allowed survivors of Liberia‚Äôs civil war to stay in the US without fear of deportation‚Äîis shameful.
Minnesota is home to one of the largest Liberian-American communities in the country: 30k strong. It‚Äôs their home.
Thanks, STEP, for a great visit, and for inspiring me to keep pushing for legislation that promotes more of what we already know works: job-training partnerships between schools and local businesses.
STEP partners with local businesses to teach students high demand skills that help them to land good paying jobs without a four year degree or loads of college debt. https://t.co/3erzZgYySL
Today I met students participating in a STEP, a technical training program located on the Anoka Technical College campus, that does exactly this. https://t.co/lLFhjRLepu
We can tackle the #skillsgap‚Äînot to mention strengthen our workforce, create jobs, and strengthen our country‚Äôs competitiveness‚Äîby investing in job training partnerships between schools and local businesses.
My first stop in Minnesota after becoming Senator was at Wyoming Machine, a local sheet metal fabricator. Like many businesses and manufacturers in Minnesota, Wyoming Machine wants to hire more people, but they‚Äôre having trouble finding workers with the right skills.
That‚Äôs why I will soon introduce a bill to authorize the successful Community Connect program through USDA. This program provides grants for areas where it is not economically viable to provide service.
I fought to include real investments in the recent government funding bill, and I‚Äôm glad that we were able to secure a new $624 million investment to expedite rural broadband expansion. But that's not enough.
In partnership with communities and broadband providers, we can make progress for Minnesota. If we don‚Äôt, hundreds of thousands of Minnesota households will continue to lack basic access to high-speed internet. We can, and must, do better than that.
And while we‚Äôve made progress in expanding access to #broadband, too many Minnesotans‚Äîespecially in rural, tribal, and low income communities‚Äî still lack access to affordable and reliable internet.
#Broadband isn‚Äôt just a nice thing to have‚Äîit‚Äôs a necessary thing to have. That‚Äôs what I heard yesterday while talking with local leaders in Grand Rapids, and what I believe, too. https://t.co/yqOmjGJQMm
Services are free and open to all Minnesota residents; no appointment necessary. For more information on the Constituent Services Tour, please call my office at 651-221-1016.

Thanks, @CLCprez, for a great visit, and for supporting job-training partnerships between @clcmnedu and companies that help students get good paying jobs and help Minnesota businesses close the #skillsgap. https://t.co/jldsLJ9l3q
I‚Äôm going to push hard for this legislation because it would help Minnesota farmers, producers, and rural businesses invest in renewable energy and fuels, cut energy costs, and support rural jobs.
The Agricultural Energy Programs Reauthorization Act would strengthen energy programs that have seen success in the current #FarmBill, including the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP), the biorefinery loan guarantee program, and the Biomass Crop Assistance Program.
I‚Äôve laid out a legislative roadmap for a strong energy section of the next federal #FarmBill so that farms, as well with agribusinesses and rural communities, can build or expand their own cost-saving energy projects. https://t.co/nPjgbTHkli
We can take commonsense steps to address gun violence while also protecting people‚Äôs rights.

My Expanding Access to Low Cost Generic Drugs Act would help tackle high prescription drug prices by addressing an anti-competitive loophole that big pharmaceutical companies exploit in order to force Americans into buying overpriced drugs.

My first piece of standalone legislation would help tackle this issue by taking aim at a big pharma tactic that keeps affordable generic drugs out of the hands of Minnesota families and seniors. https://t.co/qqs9SDB2KB
I listened to Minnesotans talk about how they‚Äôve been hit hard by the high prices they‚Äôre forced to pay for medicines they need to treat serious health problems, and we discussed ways to bring down prescription drug prices.	https://t.co/4O00H6FUb4
The amount of money that many Minnesotans are paying for their prescription drugs is out of control. That‚Äôs what I hear when I travel around Minnesota, and that‚Äôs what I heard yesterday at a roundtable discussion at @UMNews @publichealthumn.
Going into the #FarmBill debate, I‚Äôm going to fight for strong safety net programs that support farmers facing slumping commodity prices, and for an energy section that will help farmers deploy more renewable energy.
I learned about the impact of low commodity prices on dairy famers‚Äîsomething that‚Äôs taken a financial and emotional toll on far too many farming families in MN‚Äîand learned about the farm‚Äôs bio-digester, which supplies renewable energy to the farm and 50+ local households.

I‚Äôm going to share the stories I heard today with my colleagues in Washington, and I‚Äôm going to keep fighting for legislation to bring drug prices down as a member of @HELPCmteDems. These are bills like the very first one I introduced in the Senate.
Nikki‚Äôs medication makes it possible for her to do things like visit Washington with her husband and two kids, but she struggles with affording the high prices. I also heard from cancer patients, educators, grassroots organizers, volunteers, researchers and professors today. https://t.co/gKq4yX6FPG
I heard from Nikki of Brooklyn Park, who is living with multiple sclerosis. At one point she couldn‚Äôt walk or drive, but Nikki joined me last Wednesday for my weekly Coffee with Tina and walked 32 miles over the course of her trip to our nation‚Äôs capital with her family. https://t.co/PBSdS52Gtl
When I travel around the state, the #1 economic issue that I hear about is the cost of health care‚Äîand a significant driver of that is the high price of prescription drugs. And that‚Äôs what I heard again today at @UMNews @publichealthumn where I hosted a roundtable discussion. https://t.co/jDUaosVFvx
I believe that every person deserves access to quality health care that they can afford. But right now, many Minnesotans struggle to pay for their coverage and others have challenges accessing care.

Recognizing the connection between human, animal and environmental health will help ensure preparedness efforts meet the needs of all people, all ages, and all communities.
Yesterday I introduced bipartisan legislation with @SenToddYoung (R-IN) to help improve public health preparedness by ensuring federal agencies advance a one health approach. https://t.co/NZ3KjDkFBr
A one health approach‚Äîthe idea that human and animal health are linked, and that they should be studied together to prevent and respond to disease outbreaks‚Äîcan help us do this.

Thanks @NationalCouncil. You can count on me to be your partner in Washington, and I‚Äôm glad my legislation has support from both sides of the aisle because addressing mental health should be a bipartisan effort. https://t.co/zcCmrZutLZ
No #snowday for #CoffeeWithTina‚Äîthanks to the Minnesotans who joined me for coffee and conversation this morning. Stay warm, be careful on the roads, and enjoy your visit to Washington. https://t.co/5NOpiDWzC0
Thanks for braving #WinterStormToby and attending #CoffeeWithTina, @BeTheMatch. Good conversation with Minnesotans over a cup of coffee is my favorite way to start the morning. https://t.co/3lPOP3jPDd
While it's snowing in Washington today, my office is open, and #CoffeeWithTina is still happening at 9 a.m. If you plan on joining me, please bundle up, and travel safely. We'll have hot coffee ready upon your arrival!
This is deeply troubling for many reasons‚Äîincluding that the program is set to be expanded to the entire VA medical system. I‚Äôm pressing the VA to explain what steps are being taken to fix these issues. We need clarification ASAP. https://t.co/zNLBaWYArK https://t.co/JA9BS1BLr7
According to a recent report by @Politico, the initial rollout of a new digital health system at a handful of military hospitals has resulted in slowdowns, serious medical errors, and a work environment in which doctors are afraid to do their jobs for fear of harming patients.
The men and women who have honorably served our nation in uniform deserve our utmost respect, and when they return home as veterans, we need to make sure they get all the benefits and care they were promised. Period.
I am eager to bring together leaders from rural MN to discuss how the federal government can better support rural communities, and hope to partner with the USDA to make sure those communities have the resources they need to combat the opioid epidemic. https://t.co/KHUh92xh3y
At a roundtable in Minnesota, @usdaRD would hear about the challenges rural Minnesotans face and the innovative work that is happening as communities step up to combat addiction and support families hurt by this crisis.
The opioid epidemic has hit rural communities across this country hard‚Äîand rural MN‚Äôs no exception. Today I invited the USDA Office of Rural Development to visit Minnesota and hear from tribal members, farmers, and others whose communities have been impacted by this epidemic. https://t.co/a4InI06dYa
Thank you, #mnag, for your contributions to our state, and know that I plan to be a fierce advocate for Minnesota ag priorities during the upcoming #FarmBill debate.
I also met with the Minnesota Corn Growers Association (@mncorn), where I told them that I strongly oppose any changes that would undermine the objectives of the Renewable Fuel Standard (#RFS). https://t.co/BH7gqIvibd
I‚Äôm glad to be meeting with Minnesota agriculture groups on #NationalAgDay. This morning I sat down with folks from the Minnesota Milk Producers Association (@mnmilk) to discuss how we can advance the success of our dairy farmers. https://t.co/YnKn0bvVED
It‚Äôs for these very reasons that I fought for a spot on the Senate Ag Committee, and why I launched a #FarmBill Working Group to hear from leaders from Minnesota‚Äôs farm, energy, forestry, conservation, and nutrition sectors. https://t.co/sY9D1OUx3t

Today the first of vessel of the 2018 commercial shipping season will depart from the Port of Duluth-Superior. The Erie Trader/Clyde S. VanEnkevort will deliver iron ore to steel mills on the Lower Great lakes. Here‚Äôs to a strong season!

In fact, just last week I reminded @SecretaryZinke about the need to fund this critical water project, and I‚Äôll keep fighting. https://t.co/AZZ3F1J6B7
I sat down with representatives from the Lewis and Clark Regional Water System to talk about the importance of rural water, and to tell them that I‚Äôm fighting to ensure the project gets the federal resources it was promised. https://t.co/txNizn2u38
Leaving this project unfinished means communities in Minnesota, Iowa, and South Dakota don‚Äôt have access to the water they need, and that the project will cost more $$$ to complete in the long run.
It‚Äôs completely baffling‚Äînot to mention problematic‚Äîthat after almost 18 years the Lewis and Clark Regional Water System still isn‚Äôt finished because it hasn‚Äôt received the federal funding it was promised.
I‚Äôve asked Mr. Read what Pfizer is doing w/ its money‚Äîespecially since big pharma is getting a $$$ windfall from the new tax law. I specifically asked about executive &amp; CEO pay. I expect to hear back soon. I know Minnesotans would also like an explanation. https://t.co/FgcmkWly4j https://t.co/K7zQ0JoS3A
You know, I hear from families all the time who are facing skyrocketing health care costs and are truly scared that they won‚Äôt be able to afford their prescriptions each month. CEOs shouldn‚Äôt be getting rewarded for squeezing these families even tighter.
Sixty-one percent. That‚Äôs how much of a pay raise Pfizer CEO Ian Read got in 2017‚Äîbringing his total possible compensation up to nearly $28 million. On top of that, there are reports that Pfizer recently hiked the prices of many of its prescription drugs. https://t.co/b0WolPhoEL

I hope Minnesotans will apply for this vital program so farmers and rural small businesses from across our state can get some help and we can rely more on homegrown and efficient renewable energy. You can learn more about the REAP program here: https://t.co/jpZWVRt9l5
And when it comes to energy, I plan on continuing to work on the Farm Bill energy title and fighting for the Rural Energy for America Progam‚Äîalso known as REAP.
All Minnesotans are affected by the Farm Bill‚Äîit helps feed thousands of Minnesota families and school children, bolsters rural economic development, and expands the production and use of renewable energy.

On Wednesday mornings when the Senate is in session, I open my Washington office to talk with Minnesotans over a cup of coffee about issues that matter most to them. And each week, coffee is provided by a local MN roaster or coffee shop.
Good morning! In a few minutes I'll be appearing on @TheView to talk about my time so far in the Senate. I hope you'll tune in from Minnesota; the show will air on your local ABC channel.

Hi everybody, Tina Smith here. Wanted to let you know I‚Äôll be appearing on @TheView tmrw morning. I can‚Äôt wait to join the group to talk about my time so far in the U.S. Senate‚Äîwhere we now have a record-setting 22 female senators‚Äî and to tell everybody what I‚Äôve been working on.
Thanks to @SenatorHeitkamp for leading this effort, and a big thanks to you, @SenatorTomUdall, for working with me on my bill to help native communities address the #opioidepidemic. I feel lucky to work with such great colleagues on @indiancommittee. https://t.co/ndoLjkFBWT
Today I heard representatives from Minnesota‚Äôs CHCs talk about how these centers help improve health, reduce health care costs, and expand access to care in our communities. I‚Äôm committed to protecting Minnesota's health care safety net, which includes CHCs. https://t.co/StkMXkia8u
I‚Äôve fought to restore millions in funding for Minnesota‚Äôs Community Health Centers (CHCs) so they can keep their doors open and continue delivering crucial health, dental, and mental health services to the more than 180,000 Minnesotans they serve every year.
Miami, I'm thinking of you. Know that Minnesota has your back and that our hearts are with everybody affected by the bridge collapse. Thank you to all of the brave men and women who are rushing to help each other right now.
I am troubled by her nomination &amp; I hope we get a chance to talk about it when I join you on @TheView tomorrow.

Yesterday my staff heard how things like affordable housing, quality childcare, and access to transit systems can help Southeastern Minnesota tackle its workforce shortage. Local leaders talked about these topics at a @semntogether meeting. https://t.co/bmzLyGIA0f
That‚Äôs why so many Minnesotans enjoy #OutdoorRecreation, like fishing and hiking, and why I‚Äôm backing a bill to support the Land &amp; Water Conservation Fund (#LWCF), which helps Minnesota conserve and promote access to public lands.
#TBT to hiking Tettegouche State Park. Minnesota is home to 10,000+ lakes, the Mississippi headwaters, incredible forests, and beautiful parks. https://t.co/zh7vTf0ZPA
Our Constituent Services Tour will also be making stops in Bemidji (https://t.co/l7A2I1LUhF) &amp; Brainerd (https://t.co/RdSnv1zDn7) on Friday. It‚Äôs our job to work on behalf of Minnesotans, &amp; we want to help as many as we can. If you have any questions, please call (651) 221-1016.

Thanks for being here, @NIHB1. I‚Äôm glad that Samuel Moose, member of Mille Lacs Band and Bemidji area representative for NIHB, was able to share a Minnesota perspective during today‚Äôs @IndianCommittee hearing on #opioids. https://t.co/QEoV9wbChB
My legislation would help tribes develop culturally-based solutions aimed at prevention, treatment, &amp; recovery. It‚Äôs long past time that we strengthen the response to the opioid epidemic in Indian Country. This bill is part of that serious response. Let‚Äôs pass it.
With that in mind, I introduced a new bill today to help native communities take on this growing problem. https://t.co/wF3VKOTFCg
Minnesota has been hit hard by the #OpioidEpidemic‚Äîand the crisis is particularly bad in tribal communities, where many people can‚Äôt access the services they need to treat mental illness or fight back against addiction.
Today, at the bipartisan select committee on pensions kick off meeting, I brought Minnesota‚Äôs perspective to the table. https://t.co/sCJz7B7zrR
Thanks, Sauk Rapids Rice High School (@isd47), for our engaging and wide-ranging conversation‚Äîso many students had great questions! #StormPride https://t.co/Hyycstxhu0
I strongly urge the White House to get on board with championing the RFS‚Äîour family farmers and clean energy producers depend on this critical program. https://t.co/OHlVaVa7ai
We can‚Äôt make that a reality without a strong #RFS. The RFS supports thousands of local jobs and helps lead to billions of dollars in economic activity, it cuts our dependence on foreign oil, and it helps reduce environmental impact.
I fought for a spot on the Senate Agriculture Committee because I want to do my part to help #mnag‚Äôs economy grow‚Äîand because I want to see our rural communities, farmers, clean energy producers, and agribusinesses thrive.
I‚Äôm calling on the White House to support MN‚Äôs rural communities and American energy independence by maintaining a strong Renewable Fuel Standard (#RFS), the federal program that sets the level of biofuels‚Äîlike ethanol and biodiesel‚Äîthat are blended into our nation‚Äôs fuel supply.

In less than 24 hours, my first meeting as part of a bipartisan select committee on pensions kicks off, and it couldn‚Äôt come at a more important time. I‚Äôll be standing up for those tens of thousands of Minnesotans when our panel convenes tomorrow. https://t.co/jTxOy6vw16
Last weekend, I sat down with a group of nearly 20 Minnesota retirees who are facing painful cuts to their hard-earned pensions if Congress fails to act. In total, at least 22,000 Minnesotans are in retirement limbo because of this crisis. https://t.co/7WJbAmfbnr

Now let‚Äôs provide the Lewis and Clark Water Project with the federal support it was promised so rural communities can have access to the water they need. https://t.co/OW7TS9yWE2
Today I asked @SecretaryZinke why the President‚Äôs budget doesn‚Äôt prioritize funding for the Lewis &amp; Clark Water Project, a critically needed water project &amp; important economic development driver for MN, IA, &amp; SD that was authorized almost 18 years ago &amp; still isn‚Äôt finished. https://t.co/tOXe9F1Fwg

The measure, which I worked on with @lisamurkowski (R-AK), is a commonsense idea to expand mental health services in schools and community-based organizations. https://t.co/I9L5JzT23u
When I became Senator, I said I wanted to go to Washington to stand up for Minnesotans, work hard, and find common ground where I can. With that in mind, I‚Äôm pleased to say I just introduced my first #bipartisan bill.
Thanks, Teddies, for a fun visit, and know that I‚Äôm fighting for programs like yours. #ThisIsAfterschool	https://t.co/1aCOo53Mg7
Last week I stopped by @BeaconsMPLS, a 21st CCLC in Minneapolis, to watch students rehearse their spring musical, ‚ÄúInto The Woods.‚Äù And I saw firsthand how important these programs are to our students and our communities. #AfterSchoolWorks #PublicSchoolsWeek https://t.co/nPRnvrjqlI
Afterschool programs that have partnered with 21st CCLC give 23,000 Minnesota students a safe environment to grow, thrive, and continue learning. Unfortunately, they often get the short end of the stick in the federal budget.
I want to talk for a minute about 21st Century Community Learning Centers (or CCLCs, for short). This federal initiative, the only of its kind, provides support for afterschool programs all over the country‚Äîincluding those serving 100+ Minnesota communities.
I‚Äôm proud to serve coffee from local Minnesota shops and roasters at #CoffeeWithTina, and recently picked up beans from Peace Coffee for this week‚Äôs gathering. If you‚Äôre a Minnesotan visiting Washington this week, I hope to see you soon. RSVP: https://t.co/jI8XzehGMg https://t.co/HsT1JY1cgc

The Farm Bill Working Group meetings are continuing across MN, and I want to thank the Minnesotans who joined my staff in Little Falls yesterday. I look forward to continue hearing what worked in the last bill, and what we can tweak to make the upcoming Farm Bill better. https://t.co/wLANqUXiUZ
At our 1st meeting, 2 of the big takeaways were that 1) we need flexibility &amp; cooperation in and across existing programs, and 2) commodities, rural development, &amp; nutrition are all important parts of the #FarmBill. Take one out, and it won‚Äôt work.
I fought for a spot on the Senate Ag Committee because ag is the foundation of MN‚Äôs economy. All Minnesotans are affected by the Farm Bill. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve launched my Farm Bill Working Group‚Äîso I can push MN priorities after hearing from as many experts in our state as possible.
When Minnesotans share their stories, I listen. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm proud to support efforts to help parents‚Äîincluding those working on a degree or workforce training program‚Äîaccess childcare. What are these efforts? Find out more here: https://t.co/TfK8UJf5Z1
Last week I heard from a young woman in Minnesota who shared that when she had her daughter at 20, she didn‚Äôt think higher education would be an option for her. But through a child care program on a college campus, she could pursue a degree and she had hope for the future.
Last month, I was named to the bipartisan Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans. I‚Äôll be sure to share the stories I‚Äôve heard today in Saint Paul with my colleagues on the panel because it‚Äôs my job to bring a Minnesota perspective back to Washington.
I want to echo the words on the back of this Minnesotans‚Äô t-shirt: Let‚Äôs pass the Butch Lewis Act. Proud to support this bill because I want to make sure all Americans‚Äîincluding the 22,000 Minnesotans who are part of Central States plan‚Äîreceive the benefits they‚Äôve earned. https://t.co/8fPwv7Txf4
I heard from retirees who did all the right things. They worked hard, played by the rules, took care of their families, and paid into their pensions.  Now the rug is getting pulled out from under them.
It‚Äôs so good to be back home in Minnesota. I started the day with almost 20 Minnesotans in Saint Paul whose pensions are at risk of drastic cuts. I‚Äôm going to fight for them in Washington to ensure that we can restore their pensions and make sure they have a secure retirement. https://t.co/MF91tL0QyL

I recently kicked off my childcare access &amp; affordability listening sessions in MN &amp; today these discussions continued in Detroit Lakes. My staff met w/ parents, community leaders, employers, providers to talk challenges families go through when searching for quality child care. https://t.co/yuKW6jEUnY
I‚Äôm listening to ideas on how we can make child care more accessible and affordable by doing what I‚Äôve done for a while now: bringing people together and asking them to share what they‚Äîand their families‚Äîexperience every day in communities across Minnesota.
I've heard from Minnesotans who have to drive 50 miles to take their kids to daycare. This takes a toll on families‚Äîit can be barrier for parents who need to work, or go to school, or who want to be involved in their community.
Thanks for having me join you to talk about the group of folks I‚Äôm bringing together to discuss the #FarmBill, @JoelKFGO. I want to hear from as many people as possible so I can continue to be a voice on the Senate Agriculture Committee for family farmers and ranchers. https://t.co/4FkTJaiuME

You can send me a message on my website, too. Your stories, input, and ideas help me as I fight for the things that matter to Minnesotans.
I‚Äôm committed to being a hardworking, accessible senator for you and your families. You can see what I‚Äôve been up to, sign up for my weekly constituent coffees, and learn how my office can help Minnesotans like you navigate federal agencies at my website: https://t.co/EGKAuvkj8I https://t.co/3QNwcdDFpz
Thank you Wyatt for the birthday wishes, and for being a strong advocate for #mnag! https://t.co/C8wbmR4yml
I‚Äôm a leader of the bipartisan Senate Rural Health Caucus, and I‚Äôm grateful to get to work with @MNFarmBureau and talk about some of the health care challenges our rural communities face, and ways we can work together to address them. https://t.co/6tuHwuNkhp
I want to make sure all Minnesotans‚Äîincluding those living in Greater Minnesota‚Äîhave access to affordable, high quality health care.
We just need #OneMoreVote to help restore #NetNeutrality protections‚Äîand we need your help to get it done. Join us in the fight to protect a free and open internet. https://t.co/8yHa2zubpl
The @FCC ‚Äôs move to end the rules that were put in place to protect #NetNeutrality was an attack on the entire principle of a free and open internet, and we have to fight back.
Since the earliest days of the internet, we‚Äôve had #NetNeutrality. It‚Äôs woven into the fabric of our internet, and it‚Äôs a reason why we‚Äôve seen innovation that‚Äôs benefited businesses, consumers, students, and anyone who uses the internet in Minnesota and across the country.
#ICYMI: Last week I helped introduce a resolution to restore the #NetNeutrality rules repealed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). https://t.co/fNuOhKGnj8
Tomorrow‚Äôs beans are from True Stone Coffee Roasters in St. Paul. If you have any questions about #CoffeeWithTina, feel free to call my office at (202) 224-5641. Hope to see you soon! RSVP here: https://t.co/jI8XzehGMg
Each Wednesday morning when the Senate is in session, I‚Äôm opening my office‚Äî309 Hart Senate Building‚Äîto visit with Minnesotans and enjoy coffee from Minnesota shops and roasters.
Are you a Minnesotan visiting our nation‚Äôs capital? Stop by my Washington office and join me for coffee and conversation tomorrow morning at 9 am.
I brought their stories back with me to Washington today, and I‚Äôll continue to work with my colleagues to protect #Dreamers and other immigrants in Minnesota and across our nation.
Today I met with immigration advocates in St. Paul and listened to their concerns about many immigration issues that need attention, like #DACA, Temporary Protected Status (TPS), and Deferred Enforced Departure (DED).
#Dreamers (including 6,000+ in Minnesota) are our neighbors, family, and friends, and they are still at serious risk of being forced to leave the only country that many of them have ever known.
Thanks to recent court orders, for the time being #DACA recipients will be able to renew their status. But the urgency to solve this crisis remains.
Today marks the date that President Trump set to officially end #DACA, a program that protects individuals‚Äîoften called #Dreamers‚Äîwho were brought to the United States as children and grew up here. Dreamers are American in every single way except for their immigration status.
My staff in Washington just surprised me with a donut party for my birthday. They were delicious, but still not as good as the üç© we have in MN. By the way, I‚Äôm always looking for new stops to hit on my Donut Outreach Tour in the state‚ÄîMinnesotans, where do I need to go next? https://t.co/xZNCSkqVHQ
Any better feeling than beating Wisconsin? Congrats @GopherWHockey on winning WCHA title, defeating the Badgers &amp; earning a bid into #NCAA tournament. The tourney starts next wk‚Äî&amp; we‚Äôll have MN vs. Wisco round 2. The State of Hockey will be cheering hard.	https://t.co/FNO5RNC4HI
This weekend I was in Minnesota listening to folks talk about child care and #mnag priorities. More on my weekend here: https://t.co/It1jfXLVjB
Here‚Äôs my proposal @andrewzimmern: let‚Äôs get together to talk abt these policies. My office is always open to Minnesotans. That goes for everybody. If any of you want to share your MN perspective on the #FarmBill, give my team a call at 202-224-5641 or email ag@smith.senate.gov. https://t.co/2V8B2mFsJt
Stay safe, MN! It might be a #snowday for many of our kids, but a lot of you still have school, work, &amp; things to do. Mix of rain &amp; sleet expected in the Twin Cities &amp; much of central MN before the snow hits. Be careful on the roads, bundle up, take care. https://t.co/W6F0QlvkNW
I‚Äôm grateful for the opportunity to listen to these livestock and veterinarian leaders talk about what‚Äôs important to them, and I‚Äôll be sure to bring their stories with me back to Washington.
I heard folks talk about the impact of the 2015 avian flu outbreak on¬†Minnesota poultry,¬†and the importance of identifying and monitoring emerging diseases.
As we move into this year‚Äôs #FarmBill debate, I‚Äôm going to be a fierce advocate for #mnag. Today I sat down with Minnesota livestock producers and veterinarians at the Minnesota Poultry Testing Laboratory in Willmar to learn about their ag priorities. https://t.co/ECBnNjlSX9
If you‚Äôre going to be in Washington, please join me. #CoffeeWithTina is free, and open to the public. If you have any questions, feel free to call my office at (202) 224-5641. RSVP here: https://t.co/jI8XzehGMg
Each Wednesday morning when the Senate is in session, I‚Äôm opening my Washington office‚Äî309 Hart Senate Building‚Äîfor coffee and conversation starting at 9 AM. I‚Äôm proud to serve coffee from Minnesota shops and roasters at each gathering.
I stopped by Lake Affect Coffee in New London to pick up beans for #CoffeeWithTina‚Äîwhich starts next week on March 7. https://t.co/AR0aJDvZQa
Today I held roundtable discussions at @UnitedWayCenMN in St. Cloud and at United Community Action Partnership in Willmar to talk about this important issue, and¬†I‚Äôm looking forward to continuing this discussion as¬†I¬†travel¬†across the state. https://t.co/04iFiVbClQ
Lack of affordable child care that‚Äôs close to home can be a huge barrier for parents who need to work or further their education. And it can strain family budgets.¬†Yet there‚Äôs a growing child care shortage in many¬†parts of our state.
I launched the Child Care Access and Affordability Tour to gather input from parents, child care providers, and #earlyed advocates¬†on how we can create more affordable, quality child care options for working families. https://t.co/iMeae6O1ll
My staff surprised me with a #donut from Nelson Bros. Restaurant and Bakery in Clearwater. They know the way to my heart. https://t.co/Mky7IXtR8R

I‚Äôm going to keep fighting to address the skyrocketing price of prescription drugs because the amount of money Minnesotans are paying for their medications is out of control, and unsustainable.
That‚Äôs why I wrote pharmaceutical company CEOs to express concern about reports of big pharma using billions in tax savings to enrich investors instead of prioritizing lowering prescription drug prices. https://t.co/y3yJrEgqIN
Too many pharmaceutical companies are putting corporate profits ahead of consumer health, forcing Minnesotans to pay sky-high prescription drug prices.
Tomorrow the Constituent Services Tour will be in Austin to meet one-on-one with local residents who need help working with federal agencies. Services are free and open to the public; no appointment necessary. https://t.co/Fd72Mgd66f
Rochester, Minneapolis, St. Cloud, Waite Park, Sandstone - These are the places my Constituent Services Tour has traveled to, and it‚Äôs only the beginning of our state wide effort to ensure folks know how we can go to bat for them when they need help with a federal agency.
RT @MNBiofuels: MN's Sen @amyklobuchar &amp; @SenTinaSmith sent a letter today to EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt, urging him to reject changes‚Ä¶
And yesterday I met with @MNBiofuels to tell them that I‚Äôll keep fighting for a strong RFS that supports American jobs, cuts our reliability on foreign oil, and reduces the environmental impact of our transportation and energy sectors. https://t.co/KklDEooHS8
I pressed @EPA to oppose any reforms that would undermine the objectives of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which requires fuel sold in the US to contain a minimum volume of biofuels set by the EPA each year. https://t.co/WSsuhkufQ9
Biofuels are good for energy security, for our environment, and for our economy.
For the sake of Minnesota farmers and our economy, we must work to ensure long-term sustainability, competitiveness, and growth for #mnag. I met with @mn_agrigrowth to talk about these important issues. https://t.co/b45y1HGnre
‚ÄúCoffee with Tina‚Äù starts next week‚ÄîMarch 7. I‚Äôm proud to say it will feature coffee from local Minnesota shops and roasters. If you have any questions, feel free to call my office at (202) 224-5641. RSVP here: https://t.co/jI8XzehGMg
When I was Lt. Governor, I‚Äôd say the job was like being invited into MN‚Äôs living room. Now I want to return the favor. My office might not be as cozy as a living room, but I want to be sure that when you‚Äôre traveling to our nation‚Äôs capital, you can still get a big MN welcome.
And to that, I want to announce that each Wednesday morning when the Senate is in session, I‚Äôm opening my office‚Äî309 Hart Senate Building‚Äîfor coffee and conversation starting at 9 AM.
When I‚Äôm not traveling around Minnesota meeting you (my favorite part of the job, by the way), I‚Äôm in Washington, fighting for what matters to our state. If you‚Äôre ever out here for a visit, I urge you to drop by my office and say hi.
Thanks @ASlavitt. It seems like a pretty commonsense idea that would help solve a real issue facing families. Big pharma CEOs probably hate it, but guess what‚ÄîI don‚Äôt work for them. https://t.co/oHGjw5vOkA
I‚Äôm on the floor with Senator Klobuchar to honor Minnesota‚Äôs Olympians with a resolution that recognizes their accomplishments. Watch live: https://t.co/6CefKjo1Yh
That early start, not to mention the fact that Minnesotans are the hardest working and most resilient people I know, helps explain why 23 of our athletes took part in this year‚Äôs Winter Games‚Äîthat‚Äôs the 3rd most of any state in the country. https://t.co/ps85csG6Aj
Once a Minnesotan can walk, you bet his or her parents will try to get them on skis, skates, or the curling rink.
It‚Äôs a commonsense measure that‚Äôs similar to a policy supported by the Trump Administration, and I‚Äôm going to fight to make it bipartisan‚Äîbecause really, unless you‚Äôre the CEO of a big drug company, you shouldn‚Äôt be opposed to this idea. https://t.co/ZXqBSCPZ8R
My bill addresses an anti-competitive loophole that big pharmaceutical companies exploit in order to force Americans into buying overpriced drugs.
Since becoming Senator, I‚Äôve traveled around MN to talk w/ families, seniors, &amp; communities. In these conversations, the topic of high prescription drug prices almost always comes up. The amount of $ Minnesotans are paying for their medications is out of control &amp; unsustainable.
My bill takes aim at a big pharma tactic that keeps affordable generic drugs out of the hands of Minnesota families and seniors.
I‚Äôm proud to announce that just a few hours ago, I introduced my first bill since in the Senate: the Expanding Access to Low Cost Generic Drugs Act, designed to help lower the cost of prescription drugs.
In MN, we know farming and technology can go hand in hand. Exciting to see the U of M‚Äôs (@UMNews) corn nitrogen deficiency technology will soon be brought to market. This will help save farmers money, reduce fertilizer runoff, and preserve crop yield. https://t.co/odDQjAimNg
I requested the hearing today on @SenatorTester‚Äôs rural waters completion bill because it would finally bring substantial federal investments to the project, and it would help Minnesota recoup its loan. I want this bill passed ASAP, and I know the people of SW Minnesota agree. https://t.co/9xkSGUyvvc
Lewis &amp; Clark would connect the tristate area to a much-needed water supply, unlocking huge economic potential for our communities. But b/c the federal government shirked its promise to help build the project, MN loaned over $44 million of its own $$$ to get the water flowing.
If you head down to Southwest Minnesota, you‚Äôll probably hear that people are beyond frustrated, and I would say rightfully so, that the Lewis and Clark Water Project is unfinished. And there‚Äôs a good reason why they‚Äôre frustrated.
There‚Äôs an important federal program to help rural communities and states like Minnesota address these health care disparities‚Äîcalled the State Office of Rural Health‚Äîand I‚Äôm fighting to renew it. https://t.co/gUzzpeire7
I‚Äôm a leader of the bipartisan Rural Health Caucus, &amp; it‚Äôs a job I take very seriously. Too often, families in rural MN have to travel far &amp; wide to get the same type of care‚Äîfor example, mental health services &amp; opioid treatment‚Äîthat might be down the street in the Twin Cities.
Today my staff heard how important quality child care and affordable housing are to communities across Minnesota, especially in our growing economy. Local leaders in Perham discussed these important issues at their annual economic development meeting today. https://t.co/RynhvQYwoj
We need #OneMoreVote in the Senate to help restore #NetNeutrality protections to make sure the internet remains a free and open platform. We can win this fight, but only if you keep making your voices heard. It makes a big difference. https://t.co/swfv1jq8D4
This week @usnews recognized Minnesota as the 2nd best state‚Äîup from #3 last year. A testament to all the Minnesotans who are helping make the #BoldNorth a better place for everyone who calls it home.	https://t.co/T6ezsVeswN

The @FCC‚Äôs move to end #NetNeutrality protections was an attack on the entire principle of a free &amp; open internet. We can‚Äôt let this one go. Today I helped intro a Senate resolution to overturn the FCC‚Äôs misguided decision &amp; we need #OneMoreVote to pass it. Join me in this fight. https://t.co/pQh4fptUEh
#NetNeutrality fuels this kind of entrepreneurship. It‚Äôs good for business and education, for communities, and for the freedom to access information without having to pay an extra toll.
Because that farmhouse was connected to the internet‚Äîand bc #NetNeutrality put him on a level-playing field w/ big businesses across the US‚Äîhe could compete with anybody. &amp; at the end of the day, he could walk out to the driveway &amp; meet his kids when they came home from school.
The dad‚Äîwho works in finance‚Äînot only needed access to the internet, but he also had to be able to make transactions and keep a pulse on the financial world.
Let me give you an idea why #NetNeutrality matters to me. And why it should matter to you, as well. A while back, I met a family who moved from the Twin Cities to Fergus Falls to live at their family farmhouse. https://t.co/I7q8UTpTcs
Today I‚Äôm joining my colleagues in Congress, tech companies, grassroots organizations, and advocates to speak out in support of restoring the #NetNeutrality protections that millions of Americans fought to establish. Watch live: https://t.co/giOMWvGa9x
#Netneutrality‚Äîthe principle that what we read, view, and watch on the internet can‚Äôt be slowed down or sped up by deep pocketed corporations. It‚Äôs what allows the website for your local brewery in Northern Minnesota to be on the same playing field as the big guys.
Or maybe you can ask for me? Tomorrow, the @cityofduluth is honoring our local Olympic curling legends at a celebration where ‚Äúathletes will enter under a canopy of curling brooms.‚Äù Check it out and give the team a warm welcome home.	https://t.co/cggl5xhD2o
You know, some people say the #Olympic rings are symbolic of the world‚Äôs continents. But I have a theory that they‚Äôre actually curling stones. Sometime I‚Äôll have to ask @TeamShuster, the #gold medal-winning curling team from the Twin Ports.
With all the new snow, it‚Äôs tempting to jump on a sled and hit the trails. But first, it‚Äôs important to learn the ins and outs of snowmobiling. I can‚Äôt think of anybody better to learn from than Ham Lake‚Äôs Marvin Buchholz, the @mndnr Snowmobile Safety Instructor of the Year. https://t.co/LzoyLmUOXY
I‚Äôm glad I can bring Minnesota‚Äôs perspective to this bipartisan select committee, and I‚Äôm committed to finding actual solutions to address this pensions emergency. https://t.co/Vb2EyNUqt7
But until there‚Äôs action to solve the crisis facing the multiemployer pension system, these folks are being forced to live in retirement limbo.
I was named to bipartisan select committee on the pension crisis. There are 22,000 Central States retirees in MN, &amp; numerous Minnesotans in other underfunded pension plans, who put in a lifetime of hard work &amp; deserve to know that their hard-earned pensions will be safe &amp; secure.

The surging cost of child care is forcing many parents in Minnesota and across the country to have to choose between going to work and paying for child care.
North of Duluth is expected to face wind chills below ‚Äì25 degrees this evening. This type of weather is exactly why we can‚Äôt eliminate #LIHEAP funding. Northern Minnesotans, please be careful, bundle up, and stay warm. https://t.co/jH3j1H79S6
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm backing @SenMarkey‚Äôs Flu Vaccine Act. Let‚Äôs give America‚Äôs medical innovators, who are the best in the world at what they do, the support they need to develop this vaccine.
A universal flu vaccine‚Äîone that could provide a lifetime of protection and wouldn‚Äôt need to be given every year‚Äîwould save lives, save money, and bring down health care costs.
This flu season has been one of the harshest in recent years, and it‚Äôs put the health of kids, seniors, and those with compromised immune systems at risk.
RT @FreshEnergy: The Low Income Heating Assistance Program serves 100,000s of Minnesotans. Cutting it without any replacement to help famil‚Ä¶
I‚Äôm co-sponsoring the Opioid Response Enhancement Act, led by @SenatorBaldwin and @SenatorShaheen, which would make much-needed investments in our states and tribal communities as they fight back against the epidemic.
The #opioid crisis has touched every community in Minnesota, and it knows no bounds. It‚Äôs past time that we strengthen the federal response.
"This rapid transition to cleaner and more sustainable energy is driving significant job growth all across the state.‚Äù -Gregg Mast, @CleanEnergyMN 	 	That's right. Investing in clean energy leads to ‚Üë affordable, clean energy and ‚Üë clean energy jobs.	 	https://t.co/DydLAgpvdR
I‚Äôm also glad that my new leadership role on the Rural Development Subcommitee gives me the opportunity to be a strong advocate for rural Minnesota‚Äôs proud ag communities.
As we move into this year‚Äôs #FarmBill debate, I‚Äôm going to push Minnesota‚Äôs priorities and talk with as many ag experts, rural businesses, and farming families as I can.
I fought for a spot on the Agriculture Committee because farming is the foundation of Minnesota‚Äôs economy. Today I joined my first agriculture committee hearing, where I was named ranking member of the Rural Development and Energy Subcommittee. https://t.co/9laU0UERSw
My bipartisan amendment with @SteveDaines to help tribal governments access and update national criminal background databases was included in the reauthorization of the Tribal Law &amp; Order Act. This will help law enforcement access information they need to keep communities safe.
Horrified by the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. No student‚Äî&amp; no parent, teacher, or school employee‚Äîshould have to go through what happened today in Parkland, FL. This tragedy repeats itself over &amp; over in our country. We must take action &amp; address gun violence
I want to do my part in Washington, so I‚Äôm backing ‚ÄúPenny-a-Pill‚Äù legislation that would require big pharmaceutical companies to fund solutions to the epidemic they helped create. Let‚Äôs get this bill passed. https://t.co/UDwEA3pd7T
I worked on this issue as Lieutenant Governor, and it‚Äôs great to see the State of Minnesota continuing that work today.
The #opioid epidemic has been devastating to families all across Minnesota, and the drug companies that helped contribute to this crisis need to pitch in to help solve it.
Join me in telling President Trump and his budget director: don‚Äôt end #LIHEAP, don‚Äôt leave 126,000 Minnesota households in the cold. https://t.co/yZX8YtZBnD
Thanks to the students and teachers from Cretin-Derham Hall HS, Rochester HS, Southwest HS and Wayzata HS for stopping by to talk about issues they care about while visiting Washington with @CloseUp_DC. https://t.co/qI9SyqfIVf
This is just one stop of our state-wide Constituent Services Tour. We‚Äôre traveling around MN to make sure folks know how we can go to bat for them when they need help w/ a federal agency. It‚Äôs our job to work on behalf of Minnesotans, &amp; we want to help as many people as possible.
My staff will be at Opportunity Center in Minneapolis (505 15th Ave) from 11:30 to 2:30pm to meet one-on-one with residents who need help working with federal agencies. Drop by anytime‚Äîno appointment necessary. As always, services are free and open to everyone.
As a member of the Senate Education Committee and Senate Indian Affairs Committee, I‚Äôm working to help Minnesota Tribal Colleges, and I‚Äôm committed to reforming the Higher Education Act in a way that makes college more affordable for all Minnesota students.
Grateful for the powerful and inspiring stories that students from 3 Minnesota Tribal Colleges shared about their paths to getting a college degree. We also talked about challenges facing their schools, and efforts needed to address them. https://t.co/nOYMwNTPOJ
Ask anybody in Minnesota and they‚Äôll tell you that having a warm place to call home in the winter isn‚Äôt an option‚Äîit‚Äôs a necessity. And that means eliminating #LIHEAP isn‚Äôt an option either. I‚Äôm going to be making that argument to the President‚Äôs top budget official.
But the Trump Administration is calling for an end to #LIHEAP, which supports 126k households in Minnesota, a state that routinely dips below zero.
Energy bills can add up fast during  cold winter months‚Äîespecially in Minnesota. But that‚Äôs why we have LIHEAP, a program that helps veterans, seniors, and families keep the heat on when the temperature drops. https://t.co/vOfWxfYPeD
I‚Äôm cosponsoring the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would help close the long-existing income gap between women &amp; men, &amp; urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to come together &amp; support this legislation because we need to ensure all women succeed. https://t.co/XQj6PmGTbl
Equal pay for equal work is good for all Americans. We‚Äôve made important progress in Minnesota to close the pay gap, but too many women‚Äîespecially women of color‚Äîin our state and across the nation still don‚Äôt get paid the same for doing the same job.
We should reject efforts to slow down or end the progress made by the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (#GLRI). For the sake of MN‚Äôs economy, tourism, &amp; precious natural resources, we should be putting more support‚Äînot less‚Äîinto restoring the Great Lakes.https://t.co/1RyzD3pxgd
That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve enjoyed consensus, bipartisan support to protect and restore these waters.
For thousands of years, people have treasured the #GreatLakes. From the earliest hunters and fishers, to traders, shippers, and tourists, Lake Superior and the rest of the Great Lakes chain have been a vital resource to our way of life.
The #skillsgap is leaving Minnesota employers with jobs unfilled. I met with @MinnStateEdu to talk about expanding job-training partnerships between schools and businesses to create career pathways for students, and help employers find people with the right training. https://t.co/nKoohCBDxF
From lectures and films to music and art, there are many ways Minnesotans are honoring #BlackHistoryMonth. Find an event near you: https://t.co/oIxg0JSDfm
During #BlackHistoryMonth, we celebrate the accomplishments of African Americans, and their significant contributions to United States history.
Tomorrow my staff will be at Opportunity Hub in Minneapolis (505 15th Ave) from 11:30 to 2:30pm. Staff will be available to meet one-on-one with residents who need help working with agencies. Services are free and open to everyone.
Last month, my staff and I began our Constituent Services Tour in Rochester. We‚Äôre traveling to every corner of MN to make sure Minnesotans know how we can go to bat for them when they need help working with a federal agency. https://t.co/OBwfpDgcg4
This spending proposal spells disaster for both the rural and metro communities in our state. Join me in telling the President to take his budget back to the drawing board. https://t.co/gDj3DZfh5J
It slashes several programs that help Minnesota families‚Äîfor example, Medicare and Medicaid, home heating assistance for our seniors, food and nutrition support, and student loan forgiveness, while at the same time, sending the federal debt soaring.
But today, rather than building on the bipartisan agreement reached last week, President Trump released a spending proposal that hits low-income and middle-class Americans the hardest.
Late last week, we passed a bipartisan two-year budget outline in Congress. While it isn‚Äôt perfect, it does a lot of good things for Minnesota and creates a framework that will hopefully prevent future Congressional budget emergencies.
I call on Congress to swiftly take up and pass a bill to prevent #Dreamers, including the 6000 in Minnesota, from being forced to leave the only country that most of them have ever known. https://t.co/8D3at3GRmL
I join them in their frustration. Let‚Äôs be clear: Republican leadership in the Senate must be held accountable to work with Democrats on solving this immigration emergency.
Many families in MN have been waiting for this moment, &amp; they‚Äôre justifiably frustrated that Congress has yet to act on the crisis facing #Dreamers‚Äîppl brought to this country at a young age who could soon face deportation as a result of President Trump ending the #DACA program.
Tonight, the Senate will open up immigration for debate.
Want to know more about how I'm working to make sure Minnesota priorities are heard in the upcoming debate over the federal #FarmBill? My interview w/ @RRFNWick is here, and I hope you'll give it a listen: https://t.co/UoprponzZ2
I organized a meeting with Electrolux workers, @amyklobuchar, @RepTomEmmer, and @MayorDaveKleis in St. Cloud to discuss how we can support Central Minnesota's workforce needs last weekend, and I‚Äôm ready to get to work.https://t.co/w2du5vBPxz
When I heard about Electrolux‚Äôs plan to close its St. Cloud manufacturing facility, it became a top priority to support the 900 Minnesotans impacted by the announced closure.
I‚Äôm committed to being a fierce advocate for economic opportunity and fairness for all Minnesotans.
I am committed to supporting Minnesotans who serve our country, as well as their families, during and after deployment. This weekend I told @MNNationalGuard soldiers how grateful I am for their service. https://t.co/RQnXkRSSg0
This weekend I discussed the future of health care reform with physicians from @mnmed. Looking forward to working together to combat Minnesota‚Äôs opioid crisis, and address the rising costs of both care and prescription drugs. https://t.co/ndnZEbN8vw
When we invest in renewable energy, here‚Äôs what happens: ‚Üë clean, affordable energy, and ‚Üë clean energy jobs. Minnesota saw nearly a 50% increase in solar jobs last year, and I‚Äôm working on policies that will keep us moving in the right direction. https://t.co/jnNU09B0Bs
Minnesotans are showing the world why we're the State of Hockey. Congrats to #TeamUSA Women's Hockey on today's win. #Olympics https://t.co/oO3crHH6fH
I came home on Friday to spend the weekend talking with Minnesotans about the issues they care about. Here‚Äôs a snapshot of what I've been up to:	https://t.co/XHdKFsDfqZ
Thanks, Senator Klobuchar. It was great to be with you and Rep. Emmer to learn more about how we can coordinate a response to the workforce needs of Central Minnesota. I was glad to organize this meeting and get everybody to the table. Now let's get to work. https://t.co/G3gbDUfC2V
I held a roundtable discussion with North Minneapolis leaders at the market to learn about economic development projects they are working on, and what federal policies can help their communities. https://t.co/tYfrp8looE
Minnesotans are working in creative and innovative ways to strengthen our communities. Take North Market, a local community development project I visited today, that serves as a grocery store and also provides¬†health care¬†&amp; education services. https://t.co/ioDBQVLGif
And today I addressed @MNNationalGuard soldiers deploying to Kuwait, and welcomed home troops returning from overseas. https://t.co/HzNvcvcH4c
This week, I cosponsored the Deborah Sampson Act, which would help fill critical gaps in VA care for women veterans.
The Minnesotans who serve our country, along with their families, make tremendous sacrifices to keep us safe. We must do everything we can to support them during and after deployment.
Today I met with physicians from the Minnesota Medical Association (@mnmed) to discuss the future of health care reform, high prescription drug prices, and efforts needed to address the opioid crisis. https://t.co/nykxUvUWF8
Over the last few yrs hundreds of thousands of Minnesotans have gained access to high-quality health coverage, cutting our state‚Äôs uninsured rate by nearly half. We need to build on that success &amp; fix what needs fixing‚Äîespecially the rising cost of both care &amp; prescription drugs.
I‚Äôm glad Congress‚Äô newly-passed bipartisan budget agreement provides funding for CHCs in MN &amp; across the country. Today I was at Open Cities Health Center in St. Paul to thank health care leaders &amp; advocates for speaking out &amp; making their voices heard. It made a huge difference. https://t.co/SUZkyywSfe
I also met w/ CHC CEOs from Cook &amp; St. Paul to discuss how budget shortfalls would‚Äôve devastated clinics &amp; cut off access to care for patients. Fed. funding helps the 17 Community Health Centers w/ 70 locations across the state provide care to as many Minnesotans as possible. https://t.co/TfogJrVXjG
I signed on to a bipartisan letter with Senate colleagues calling on the federal government to immediately fund Community Health Centers nationwide.
This week I‚Äôve been pushing hard to restore millions in funding for Minnesota‚Äôs Community Health Centers (CHC), which provide health, dental, and mental health services to 180,000+ Minnesotans annually.
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but wouldn‚Äôt alligator wrestling be included in the Summer Olympics? Now ice fishing, there‚Äôs an idea for the Winter Games. https://t.co/v7m9pdbSOI
And he never shied away from a fight when we needed him‚Äîwe all remember his fiery speeches, unflinching principles, and his willingness to stand up to big money and powerful people on behalf of MN families. Rick is a friend, &amp; I will miss working with him. https://t.co/dQ9AZgH8nH
Congressman Nolan is a relentless advocate for his constituents. He wasn't afraid to reach across the aisle to work with those he didn‚Äôt always agree with to get things done for Minnesotans.
I thank @USRepRickNolan for his years of dedicated public service and constant advocacy for the people of Northern Minnesota. This is a bittersweet retirement. I‚Äôm happy that Rick will be able to spend more time with his wonderful family, and I know his voice will be missed.
That‚Äôs why I recently helped introduce legislation to tackle the nation‚Äôs ‚Äúskills gap.‚Äù This commonsense bill would address it head-on by expanding something that we know works: job-training partnerships between two-year schools and local businesses.
I wanted to go there because, like many businesses and manufacturers around Minnesota, Wyoming Machine wants to hire more people, but they‚Äôre having trouble finding workers with the right skills.
My first official stop in Minnesota after becoming Senator was at Wyoming Machine, a local sheet metal fabricator that‚Äôs doing great things. https://t.co/FATVXyGpb5
I'm working hard to protect MinnesotaCare coverage, and I want to thank @SenAlexander and @PattyMurray‚Äîand all Health Committee members‚Äîfor working with me to reverse these cuts as part of their bipartisan market stabilization legislation. Hope we can work to pass this into law.
Yet recent actions by the Trump Administration have jeopardized the long-term stability of these programs, putting MinnesotaCare coverage at risk for families. In total, Minnesota stands to lose $806 million in federal funding for MinnesotaCare, which is a huge blow.
In Minnesota we have a Basic Health Plan, called MinnesotaCare, which is a lifeline for working families, offering low-cost, comprehensive health coverage to more than 100,000 Minnesotans.
I've been a senator for just over a month now. And each day I go to work, I think abt how I can use my voice in Washington to speak for working families in MN. That's why today during a Health Cmte hearing, I had to bring up something at the forefront of many Minnesotans‚Äô minds. https://t.co/mIVyoUx7WQ
And then there are other stakeholders in the Ag Working Group with backgrounds in rural development, rural health, and nutrition. It's a great group of folks from across the state, and I‚Äôll take what I learn from them and get to work for Minnesota.
We talked about my new Ag Working Group, which will bring together Minnesotans with a deep understanding of farm policy and how it impacts our state‚Äôs producers, businesses, and communities. They‚Äôll advise me on things like crop insurance, research, conservation, and energy.
I started my day by sitting down with Red River Farm Network's @RRRNWick here in Washington to talk about how I plan to push Minnesota priorities in the upcoming #FarmBill after hearing from as many Minnesota experts as possible. https://t.co/L32b55uM6d
Proud to be working alongside you too, @SenDuckworth. Our commonsense bill would address the #skillsgap head-on by expanding something that we know works: job-training partnerships between two-year schools and local businesses. #CC2C https://t.co/CGubpvlGj1
Because often when you‚Äôre a Minnesotan, once your kids can walk, you bet they can start skating, skiing, or even curling. I can‚Äôt wait to watch our athletes go for gold over the next two weeks. https://t.co/QjYmjFLhoy
I‚Äôm so proud of the Minnesota Olympians who are getting ready to put the best of our state on display in South Korea. I continue to be amazed that we‚Äôre sending 21 athletes to compete in the Winter Games‚Äîthird most in the entire country‚Äîbut I‚Äôm not all that surprised.
My first official stop in Minnesota after becoming Senator was at Wyoming Machine. Great to have one of the sheet metal fabricator‚Äôs owners, Traci Tapani, visiting my office here in Washington today. Thanks for being a partner in working to address #skillsgap in MN &amp; our nation. https://t.co/DJ8eFKbfLs
My statement on the promising bipartisan budget compromise and why we still need to protect Dreamers here: https://t.co/HquOpfbdsp
My Democratic colleagues and I agree: American workers &gt; corporate interests. #TipRule https://t.co/5vrgmzwC6P https://t.co/KgUTW08Lv9
The Trump Administration should withdraw their terrible proposal. Restaurant workers and others who earn on tips deserve to be able to keep the money they‚Äôve worked for.
Want to know what's even worse? According to reports, this administration‚Äôs own Department of Labor concealed evidence showing that the proposed rule would result in employees losing billions.
Back in December, the Trump Administration proposed changing tip rules to allow employers to essentially steal workers‚Äô tips. That‚Äôs right: they want to do away with protections that keep bosses from stealing potentially billions of dollars from workers.
If you‚Äôre a restaurant worker or hold a service job, your livelihood‚Äîthat means the ability to pay rent, tuition, child care, groceries, or bills‚Äîoften depends on tips.
As a member of the Senate Health Committee, I‚Äôm pushing to fix this problem as soon as possible, and I‚Äôll be working with Senate leadership to figure out how we can get this done in a bipartisan way. https://t.co/BO004wo50Q
We‚Äôre facing a serious health care crisis in MN, and it demands a serious response. Without action to protect MinnesotaCare, the long-term financial stability of a program that helps provide affordable coverage for more than 100,000 Minnesotans is at risk. https://t.co/CTekUt2kyg
üö®URGENT: The Trump Admin is mulling lifetime Medicaid caps. That‚Äôs the worst kind of policy‚Äîone that undermines the purpose of Medicaid &amp; hurts people who may not have other care options. Join me in fighting this brazen attack on millions of Americans.üö® https://t.co/2zCP4JjPpo
I sat down with the Minnesota Private College Council (@mnprivcolleges) to hear how they‚Äôre working to expand access to higher education for first-generation and low-income students, and reduce student debt for students. https://t.co/2qAxR1Us8a
As a member of the Senate Education Committee, I‚Äôm working hard to improve both college affordability and access to college as we rewrite the Higher Education Act.
I‚Äôm going to fight to make sure there is a strong, independent watchdog for consumers at CFPB. We can‚Äôt allow the agency created to protect consumers to become a crony of the very financial institutions that routinely take advantage of the American public.	https://t.co/fP6VpRziD6
I believe Wall Street banks &amp; big financial institutions should be held accountable when their actions harm Minnesotans &amp; break the public‚Äôs trust. Restricting the probe into Equifax would send a signal that the CFPB is no longer focused on its core mission: protecting consumers.
Now President Trump and his nominee to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (@CFPB) are faced with a choice: are they going to side with the 143 million people whose data was compromised, or the giant financial institution that kept the hack from the American public?
It‚Äôs very disappointing that the Trump Administration is reportedly limiting a full-scale investigation into the Equifax hack, which exposed the personal data of close to half the country. https://t.co/J5LOxfP9yI
I've joined a bipartisan group of my colleagues urging @POTUS to include funding for both #LIHEAP and the Weatherization Assistance Program in his 2019 budget because these programs are critical to helping low-income households, veterans, and seniors.
In unusually cold winter months, energy bills can add up fast. The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (#LIHEAP) helps make sure families in Minnesota and our nation can make ends meet and stay warm.
I do not see eye to eye with the President and Republicans in Congress on many issues. But where we are able to identify areas of common ground, and where the President is willing to work in good faith, I &amp; many of my colleagues stand ready to work w/ him. https://t.co/Wl8egwzjC3
#ICYMI: Last week I delivered the Weekly Democratic Address on the President‚Äôs first official State of the Union address.
I know how important the @USDA sugar program is to the economy &amp; jobs in NW MN. That's why I'll work to preserve it in the #FarmBill. Thanks to sugar beet producers for meeting w/ me in DC today. Great to see some of the same faces who were at my recent Farm Bill meeting in Ada. https://t.co/g0T6d4gvlX
Workers shouldn't be forced to go without a paycheck when they take time off to care for a new child or a sick family member. That's why I'm supporting the #FAMILYAct, which would provide paid leave for private-sector workers. #FMLA25 https://t.co/IvlsiQvAyH
While I served as Lieutenant Governor, I worked to provide paid family leave for 34,000 State of Minnesota employees. And now, I want to build on that success and be a part of enacting paid family leave for families in MN and across the country.
A couple of weeks ago, I sat down with paid family leave advocates and Minnesotans at @UMNews @HHHSchool who‚Äôve benefited from family leave policies because I believe there‚Äôs more we must do for workers. https://t.co/UXtOkroDgo
Today marks the 25th anniversary of the landmark Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). While #FMLA guarantees workers time off to care for a new child or a sick family member, it doesn't require that an employee be paid for that time. We need to change that. #FMLA25
When I became a new mom in 1987, and had my second child in 1989, I worked for myself as a small business owner and was lucky that I could take the time off to care for my newborn. But having access to paid family and medical leave shouldn‚Äôt be about luck. #FMLA25
Hear, hear! And how about another cheer for the @UMNmarch band? https://t.co/506H9Z14Jy
Sally battled dementia, as my mother did, so we said a long goodbye. My thoughts are with her friends, family, and the many people who loved and respected her. She was a woman to love. https://t.co/nzwAUfULuI

A balmy 0¬∞ before windchill in Minneapolis tonight makes #SB52 the coldest on record. I'm thankful to be watching the game (indoors) with my family and I'm sure almost everybody at the stadium shares that opinion--except maybe Bud Grant. https://t.co/IW7mvSzBJf

Out-of-towners attending the #SuperBowl, I have a question for you. Will you leave your winter gear‚Äã &amp; help Minnesotans before you head home from the #BoldNorth? There are 12+ locations where you can donate clothing &amp; help those experiencing homelessness. https://t.co/StmEORQfPr

Minnesota is fighting for its CHC funding, and as a member of the Senate Health Committee, I‚Äôve taken that fight to Washington. Over the next few days, I will be pushing hard to secure long-term funding for Community Health Centers to protect care for Minnesotans. https://t.co/TiAUvoLchN
If we don‚Äôt act soon to authorize this program, Minnesota Community Health Centers will have to lay off workers, close sites, and scale back services, including medication assistant therapies for those struggling with opioid addiction. We can‚Äôt let this happen.
Congress must act now to reauthorize Community Health Centers, which deliver vital health care services to more than 180,000 Minnesotans across the state. Their future hangs in the balance.
I believe we should pass protective measures to help insulate the Trump-Russia investigation from further political interference, and I also believe we should reaffirm our faith in the thousands of men and women in the FBI who help protect us each and every day. #MemoDay
This memo‚Äîwritten by Republicans &amp; released by Republicans despite ‚Äògrave concerns‚Äô from the President‚Äôs own FBI abt the memo‚Äôs omissions and factual inaccuracies‚Äîis a partisan effort by the President‚Äôs allies to undermine &amp; discredit an investigation of the President himself.
That‚Äôs why we have a special investigation going on, led by Robert Mueller.
Russia is a hostile foreign government that interfered in the 2016 presidential election w/ the goal of undermining our democracy. No serious person disputes that fact. And we know that members of Trump‚Äôs team were aware of Russia‚Äôs meddling &amp; even welcomed offers of assistance.
Thank you @MNNationalGuard for helping ensure football fans have a safe and fun time at the #SuperBowl. #SB52 https://t.co/Q4Hbxi9YKj

Minnesota family farmers, ranchers, and rural businesses help keep our state strong. And when they fall on hard times, we need to have their backs.
Today I met with Canadian Consul General Paul Connors (@PJConnors) to talk about the importance of a strong cross-border relationship and fair trade policies for Minnesota workers. I look forward to working together to address the key issues our countries face. https://t.co/TD6RKSp4V0
I‚Äôm committed to working w/ all of my colleagues to find common ground. I sat down w/ Chair of Senate Energy Committee @lisamurkowski (R-AK)‚Äîwho I also serve w/ on Indian Affairs &amp; HELP‚Äîto talk about how we can work on #bipartisan efforts that will help move our country forward. https://t.co/cRFif1JdXJ
I met with members of the Coalition for Rochester Area Housing to identify gaps in Rochester's housing market, and resources needed to create more #AffordableHousing as the region grows.	https://t.co/if2v1JdFmc
Affordable housing makes significant improvements to the lives of Minnesota families‚Äîand we need more of it.
And we take home the #Grammy! Congrats to the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra (@thespco) on earning a Grammy for a recording with @PatKopViolin inspired by Schubert‚Äôs ‚ÄúDeath and the Maiden.‚Äù I‚Äôm always proud of Minnesota‚Äôs vibrant and diverse music scene.	https://t.co/sVMscQXTdL
Minnesota is always innovating and developing new solutions to challenging problems. I‚Äôm taking the ideas we discussed back to Washington to help guide my work as a member of the Senate Health Committee and a leader on the Rural Health Caucus.		https://t.co/cP6gvIDF9X
We need to redouble our efforts to ensure all Minnesotans, no matter where they live, have access to high-quality, affordable health care. I met w/ rural health care leaders at @LRH_Health to talk about challenges they face in making sure rural providers can deliver quality care. https://t.co/IqIXlmcB2v
Thanks to all the Minnesotans I met with this weekend. It is an honor to be able to take your stories back with me to Washington and continue to be a fierce advocate for all of you. More on what I've been up to: https://t.co/qcDHePAg5p
A visit to Rochester isn't complete without a stop at Daube's Bakery for a doughnut. https://t.co/1wqKHnlQxy
Held a roundtable discussion in Rochester with members of the Coalition for Rochester Area Housing¬†to talk about¬†the region‚Äôs housing needs, and resources needed to ensure an adequate supply of affordable housing as the region continues to grow. https://t.co/nPUFDOhhml
We need to take a holistic approach to health care‚Äìand that means recognizing the relationship between health and housing. Those with mental health issues are at a greater risk of homelessness, and a lack of stable housing corresponds with worse health outcomes.
It‚Äôs my job to work on behalf of Minnesotans. Today my staff and I talked about how we provide free assistance to Minnesotans who need help working with federal agencies. https://t.co/0EGOG5l3ql
The report that President Trump sought to fire Robert Mueller‚Äîthe man leading the Trump-Russia investigation‚Äîis profoundly disturbing, to say the least. I plan to support measures that would help protect this investigation from further political interference.
On top of that, members of the Trump campaign and members of the Trump administration knew about Russia‚Äôs meddling and welcomed offers of assistance.
Russia is a hostile foreign government that interfered in the 2016 presidential election with the goal of undermining our democracy. No serious person disputes that fact.
It‚Äôs critical that we honor Native communities in our state‚Äôs history. Today I sent a letter to the U.S. Geological Survey to tell them I support @mndnr‚Äôs proposal to rename Lake Calhoun in Minneapolis to its original Dakota language name, Bde Maka Ska. https://t.co/DrJvG6CQZI
I sat down with health care leaders from across northwest Minnesota to discuss the challenges they‚Äôre facing and efforts needed to improve health care in the region. https://t.co/HCZJhgrc5P
As a member of the Senate Health Committee and a leader on the Rural Health Caucus, one of my top priorities is making sure that all Minnesotans‚Äîincluding those in rural areas‚Äîhave access to quality health care.
Minnesotans living on farms and in small towns often have a more difficult time getting health care than people in urban areas. And that‚Äôs not ok.
Stopped by Union Pizza and Brewing Co for lunch with Fergus Falls mayor @ffmayorben. Thanks for the delicious pizza and artistic welcome! https://t.co/D7AnHfE3lC
RT @MNFarmersUnion: MFU Vice President @KlabundeBryan and Field Representative Ken Pazdernik attended a #FarmBill discussion with @SenTinaS‚Ä¶
And today I met with economic development leaders in Ada to learn about how Rural Development programs can be improved or expanded during the #FarmBill debate. https://t.co/I3vcbPslPp
As a leader of the Senate Rural Health Caucus, I‚Äôm working to expand access to affordable, high-quality care‚Äîa serious challenge for a lot of rural communities in Minnesota.
We must help rural communities overcome the unique challenges they face when it comes to access to essential things like health care, housing, and child care facilities.
The notion that the President would dangle a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers as a bargaining chip, and demand in exchange a wish list of his most hardline anti-immigrant proposals is the most cynical kind of politics. My full statement: https://t.co/U4p3yeH75a
This morning Congressman Collin Peterson and I talked with local producers and farm leaders about northwestern Minnesota ag priorities. https://t.co/4zrY7MMhRI
Farming is a pillar of the Minnesota economy, and a way of life for thousands of families. I‚Äôm fighting for the family famers, ranchers, and rural communities that keep our state strong by making sure their voices are heard during the #FarmBill debate.
Started the day off by talking about rural development and agriculture priorities on KRJB. https://t.co/MpLmwuhiBu
Thanks for the warm welcome, Ada. I‚Äôm in town today with Congressman Collin Peterson to talk with Minnesotans about issues they care about. https://t.co/vvQfiVnAbE
Good morning Red River Valley of the North! Great to be back in Minnesota. https://t.co/pPSGbcOanx
I‚Äôm calling on Congress to end the flood of unchecked, unlimited, and secret corporate money into our elections.¬†We need to overturn Citizens United, and we need to pass the #DISCLOSEAct to give people an idea of where all this money is coming from. ¬†https://t.co/1Bxnqp75ye
Because of #CitizensUnited‚Äîthe SCOTUS decision that opened the door to unlimited corporate spending in politics‚Äîmore than $600 million in dark money has been spent to take over our elections.
Our democracy is built on the principle that the American people have the power in our elections.¬†But that democratic principle is in danger.
Sure, a lot of people know that we call casserole ‚Äúhot dish,‚Äù and soda ‚Äúpop‚Äù. But there are a couple other tips for how to talk‚Äîand act‚ÄîMinnesotan that out-of-towners attending @MNSuperBowl2018 might like to know: https://t.co/zYSvJI6BUr
.@JRosenworcel of @FCC calls this ‚Äúthe cruelest part of the digital divide.‚Äù I agree. We need to be doing everything we can to expand broadband access in Minnesota and across our nation.
But 12 million students across the country still lack access to high-speed internet at home that‚Äôs needed to complete their homework. #HomeworkGap
For 20 years, the federal ‚Äú#Erate‚Äù Program has helped connect Minnesota schools and libraries to broadband, providing students many of the tools they need to access a high-quality education.
Today my staff is at the Minnesota Ag Expo in Mankato to listen to Minnesota farmers and ranchers talk about ag issues and priorities for the upcoming year. #MNAgExpo18 https://t.co/WwiDAXW6P6
Farming is vital to Minnesota‚Äôs economy, and I want to help improve the success of all farmers by making sure that every voice is heard during the #FarmBill debate.
And to do better we need more resources and stronger funding. We can‚Äôt afford to let this crisis continue spiraling out of control. As a member of the @HELPCmteDems, I‚Äôm fighting to improve #opioid prevention, treatment, and recovery for Minnesota.
I‚Äôm troubled by a recent report that says the number of opioid-related deaths in Hennepin County have nearly doubled in the past 2 years. We must do better. 	https://t.co/nJuIL6MdHM
Earlier this month, I met with Minnesotans at the forefront of battling the #opioid crisis, which has stolen lives in every part of our state. Cities, suburbs, rural communities, and Indian Country are all in the crosshairs of this epidemic. https://t.co/BQmonYYPUj
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm supporting @SenSherrodBrown‚Äôs Butch Lewis Act, a bill that would make sure all of those 22,000 Minnesotans receive the benefits they earned. I‚Äôll be working with my Senate colleagues to fight to pass this measure into law for our workers and their families.
There are 22,000 Minnesotans whose pensions‚Äîearned through a lifetime of hard work‚Äîare at risk of essentially going belly up due to chronic underfunding. These Central States retirees deserve their pensions, and they deserve the certainty of knowing their retirement is secure.
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm working with @amyklobuchar and @USRepRickNolan to press @POTUS to take swift and decisive action in response to recommendations from @CommerceGov‚Äôs investigation on the effect of steel imports on national security.
The iron ore and steel industry is a critical component of our national security, and we need to make sure that the rise in steel imports isn‚Äôt putting the jobs of iron ore and steel workers in Minnesota at risk.
Today we sat down to talk about his vision for the city as he begins his first term, and we discussed things like expanding access to early education programs and higher education, community policing, and building an inclusive economy. https://t.co/Rtk4HHVWJ6 https://t.co/GXjyu52bts
Minnesota is home to progressive leaders committed to bringing people together, improving people‚Äôs lives, and getting things done. Leaders like @melvincarter3‚Äîthe mayor of @cityofsaintpaul.
I‚Äôm proud of the work I did as Lt. Governor to expand access to early childhood programs in Minnesota. As Senator, you can count on me to continue working with Minnesotans like Gayle Kelly, Director of MN #HeadStart, to narrow the achievement gap in MN and our nation. https://t.co/n8mT9hqqc0
The answer should have been an easy no. But that‚Äôs not the answer Mr. Brownback gave. Not acceptable for someone seeking a job where it‚Äôs his duty to advocate for the dignity and freedom of all people. LGBT Americans deserve to be treated with respect.
In 2017, @timkaine asked Gov. Brownback‚Äînominee for Ambassador At Large for Int‚Äôl Religious Freedom‚Äîif he believes there‚Äôs any circumstance where religious freedom can justify criminalizing, imprisoning, or executing somebody based on their LGBT status. https://t.co/xmgMs6hprP
I voted against Azar today, and while I‚Äôm disappointed that he was confirmed, I nevertheless plan to hold him accountable for the millions of families in Minnesota and across the country who simply cannot afford paying more for their prescriptions. https://t.co/MQSI4oePwA
And when a pharmaceutical executive at a company with a history of hiking prescription drug prices is tapped by President Trump to run our health department, we shouldn‚Äôt be shocked if families already facing sky-high drug costs end up getting an even rawer deal.
If a fox is tasked with guarding the henhouse, we wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the chickens don‚Äôt make it past sunrise.
Alex Azar is the wrong pick to run the Department of Health and Human Services, and I strongly opposed his nomination today when it came before the Senate. Let me tell you why.
We must combat #climatechange to ensure our kids will be able to live in an environment where there‚Äôs clean air and safe drinking water. I sat down with @CleanAirMoms‚Äô littlest leaders to talk about this important issue. https://t.co/R6BDiAWcbs
But now, under the Trump Admin, I‚Äôm concerned that the CFPB may be abandoning its core mission. I believe that consumers in Minnesota and our country should always come first. https://t.co/FKO69fVDNP
Created in response to the 2008 financial meltdown, the @CFPB has served as one of the first lines of defense for millions upon millions of Americans who have been harmed by corporate wrongdoing.
Congratulations on your pregnancy, @SenDuckworth. Archie and I wish you and your family the very best.
Land conservation matters to hunters, farmers, outdoorsmen and women, nature enthusiasts, and anybody who wants to keep our state beautiful. Last week, I met with leaders from @pheasants4ever, which is headquartered in Minnesota, to discuss #FarmBill conservation programs. https://t.co/1lWWgH4VVo
The least we can do is help lessen that burden. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm backing a bill originally introduced by @SenWarren, which would establish a nat‚Äôl effort to help tens of millions of Americans refinance their student loan debt at lower rates, saving them money each and every month. https://t.co/jyxyM6RCp5
The price tag on a college degree is leaving too many of our next generation of innovators, entrepreneurs, and community leaders with a lifetime of debt to pay back.
Glad Shakopee Vice Chair Keith Anderson from Minnesota was able to join @IndianCommittee in Washington last week. We talked about nutrition and indigenous food programs during a roundtable on native food traditions. https://t.co/cPM75cEhp4
We must protect the health care resources that Minnesotans depend on‚Äîthat‚Äôs why I‚Äôm fighting to fund community health centers and to prevent cuts to #MinnesotaCare. I sat down with James Hereford, President and CEO of @FairviewHealth, to talk about both of these key issues. https://t.co/sOOqU4yCjl
We need to ensure our electric grid is reliable and resilient enough to withstand extreme weather conditions, like the snowstorm that hit Minnesota yesterday. I asked experts how renewable energy and energy storage will benefit the electric grid in the Energy Committee today. https://t.co/Oj5Gmlwyg6
I met with Michelle Behr, Chancellor of @UMMorris, to discuss the need for a comprehensive higher education reform bill that improves both college affordability and access to college. https://t.co/w1iLMHKYpn
The price tag of a college degree is a serious source of anxiety for Minnesota families. The student debt crisis is out of control, and on top of that, first generation and low-income students face high hurdles when it comes to attending college.
We love our snow in Minnesota, but we also understand how dangerous winter weather can be. Yesterday‚Äôs storm left many parts of Minnesota with poor driving conditions, school delays, and lots of shoveling to do. Be careful today, bundle up, and stay warm. https://t.co/lKmicCZ2bD
That's commitment GOP refused to make even last Friday despite fact that measure has bipartisan support. This is a human rights issue &amp; speaks to who we are as Americans. And it‚Äôs a fight I remain committed to winning. https://t.co/CEOu2MGRvi
And the Republican leadership made a commitment to bring up legislation on the Senate floor to prevent hundreds of thousands of young people brought to this country by their parents as children from being deported.
The bill will address a number of important issues that affect MN, including a 6-year extension of #CHIP. It also opens a path for a long term budget bill that funds important priorities for MN including health care, disaster relief, pensions, and addressing the opioid epidemic.
Today I voted to reopen the government, to continue negotiations on a comprehensive budget bill important to Minnesota and our country, and in favor of an agreement for the Senate to take up legislation to stop hundreds of thousands of Dreamers from facing deportation.
I‚Äôve only been here for about three weeks, but I know that you can‚Äôt run a great country on a month to month budget. A fundamental responsibility of Congress is to pass a budget. This was supposed to be done over 100 days ago.
And now we're one step away from a Super Bowl game on home turf. Let's #BringItHome for all the fans who've been waiting for this moment. #NFLPlayoffs

.@Vikings fans had some pretty incredible reactions to last week‚Äôs #MinneapolisMiracle. https://t.co/o8SUMehURy
It‚Äôs easy to be optimistic when everything‚Äôs going your way. The question is, can you keep that optimism when things get difficult? Thousands have been marching in #WomensMarch2018 around the world, including in Minnesota. Know that the women of @SenateDems are w/ all of you. https://t.co/UdkHTZChSE
You mean like if you control the House, the Senate, and the White House? Except in this case, it's the American public who loses. We deserve better. Republicans: come to the table and let's get this done. https://t.co/vtJQjdZg5a
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any reason for a gov't shutdown, esp. bc there‚Äôs a bipartisan path forward. And I definitely don‚Äôt think Congress should get paid while not doing our jobs. That‚Äôs why I cosponsored a bill that would withhold congressional pay in the event of a shutdown.
Senate Dems don‚Äôt want a gov‚Äôt shutdown. We want a budget that moves our country forward and enacts policies already supported by Republicans and Democrats. I joined some @SenateDems colleagues to say we‚Äôre better than this &amp; want to work across the aisle on a bipartisan budget. https://t.co/iCWWXUdDzt
With everything going on in Washington, it was wonderful chatting with a delightful Minnesotan, 4-year-old Sadie, who is the daughter of a member of my team and perhaps one of the most mature people on Capitol Hill. https://t.co/fR4E30CzWO
@HouseGOP Unlike Republicans, if Democrats had control of the House and the Senate and the	White House we would have never let the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program	expire. You did that.
If a shutdown happens, it would be the first time that one party is in charge of everything and the government gets shut down. It's important to note that the only person who seems to want a shutdown is the President. https://t.co/qSmkMEGJLD
I was up early this morning to talk about what‚Äôs going on in Washington. Look, we have Republicans in charge of the House and the Senate, and the White House.
I'll be on CNN @NewDay to talk about what's happening in Washington shortly. Hope you'll tune in.
All things that affect real people who‚Äôve been forced to keep waiting on a Washington thrust into chaos for no good reason.¬†This is no way to govern. No more excuses. They need to get the job done. https://t.co/Se3yu9S24s
Resources to combat the #opioid epidemic that taken the lives of hundreds of people in Minnesota and countless others across the country.
Funding to keep the doors open to 2,800 community health centers that serve some 9 million people, including more than 180,000 Minnesotans.¬†Disaster relief for the millions of people affected by recent storms and fires across the country.
A solution that prevents #Dreamers‚Äîpeople who were brought to this country by their parents as children‚Äîfrom being deported.
Long-term funding for the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program (often called #CHIP) that provides health coverage for 125,000 children in Minnesota and millions of kids across the country.
I hope a budget would include a few things, among them: A fix to preserve the #pensions that hundreds of thousands of Americans were promised, including more than 20,000 Minnesotans.
People in Minnesota and across the country deserve the certainty that comes with a long-term federal budget. Republicans‚Äîwho, as a reminder, control the House, Senate, and White House‚Äîshould be able to work with Democrats and get this done.
#TBT to visiting a farm in Kasota to learn about its #solarenergy production. As a member of @SenateAgDems, I‚Äôll be working on the energy section of the #FarmBill to help more Minnesota farmers and ranchers benefit from renewable energy. https://t.co/jSX8DnghyN
Glad we got to sit down to talk about Minnesota cooperatives, @MemberOwned, and thanks for the contributions that you make to Minnesota's ag community. https://t.co/s7qsLr9n9B
Today I joined @PattyMurray in asking how we can help people better understand their financial aid options by making the process more focused on who it impacts most‚Äîstudents and families. https://t.co/78akxOtU9L
Students and families in Minnesota shouldn‚Äôt be left in the dark when it comes to understanding the cost of college, but financial aid packages can be really difficult to understand. I want to change that.
It‚Äôs bad for seniors who don‚Äôt know what programs they can count on. Not to mention that this method of short-term budgeting keeps fed gov‚Äôt from making efficient long-term investments. If House bill makes its way over to the Senate, I wouldn‚Äôt support it. https://t.co/Se3yu9S24s
The short term budget the House is voting on later today is both bad on substance and bad from a budgeting perspective. It‚Äôs bad for defense. It‚Äôs bad for farmers and businesses who are trying to plan. It‚Äôs bad for employees who were hoping to get new job training.
There is no reason we should be facing a government shutdown, especially since there seems to be a bipartisan path forward. I‚Äôve only been here two weeks and I‚Äôm already frustrated that Congress is kicking the can down the road instead of enacting an actual budget.
I attended my first hearing as a member of @IndianCommittee, where I asked Janie Simms, Director of Indigenous Food &amp; Agriculture Initiative, how we can strengthen local economies and build healthier communities through indigenous foods. https://t.co/raAet60fsD

We need to make sure emergency response funding is in place to help Minnesotans and all Americans when there‚Äôs an outbreak or disaster.
Great to meet with members of the Minnesota Hospital Association (@MNHospitals) today. Talked about ways we can lower health care costs, combat the #opioid epidemic and improve healthcare for #rural Minnesotans. A lot to tackle together in 2018. https://t.co/EpaPL8fjqY
I asked Austin Ewell from the @Interior to fulfill its obligation to Minnesota and finish the Lewis and Clark Project, which moves water to communities in Southwestern Minnesota. https://t.co/4FpuzbIPD1
While Minnesota is the land of 10,000+ lakes, Southwestern Minnesota faces droughts and water shortages. Lack of access to secure water supply hurts rural economic development.
A record number of Minnesotans signed up for insurance during #OpenEnrollment, meaning that more Minnesotans will get quality health coverage in 2018. BUT we still have work to do on addressing health care cost costs‚ÄîI know it‚Äôs a huge burden to a lot of people. https://t.co/zsACr4NavS

Minnesota is already a leader in renewable energy. And as a member of @EnergyDems, I‚Äôll be pushing for policies that keep us moving in the right direction.
We also discussed how to encourage new research, technology, and innovation to ensure we‚Äôre well positioned for the future. https://t.co/h7nIalK73h

Last wknd I traveled to Kasota to meet w/ the owner of a farm that produces #SolarEnergy, which has the benefit of being affordable, reliable, &amp; clean.

The iron and steel industry is a critical component of our national security, and I am concerned that the recent increase in illegal steel dumping puts our nation and the jobs of thousands of iron and steel workers at risk.
#TBT to paying a visit to Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox in Bemidji. I‚Äôll be heading back to MN this weekend because I want to make sure Minnesotans know they can count on me to make their voices heard in Washington. https://t.co/FdNijr1pbE https://t.co/hQztqJvgg0

Farming isn‚Äôt just a pillar of the Minnesota economy‚Äîit‚Äôs a way of life for thousands of families. As a new member of the @SenateAgDems, I‚Äôm going to fight each day for the family farmers, ranchers, and rural businesses that keep our state strong.

I‚Äôm supporting legislation to grant stability and security to recipients of #TPS by allowing them to apply for permanent residency because it‚Äôs both the smart and the right thing to do. #SaveTPS
#TPS recipients contribute to our workforce, have American-born children, and call the United States their home. Ending TPS would harm our economy and communities and it would tear families apart.
The Trump administration‚Äôs decision to end what‚Äôs called Temporary Protected Status‚Äîor #TPS, for short‚Äîfor Salvadorans who have lived and worked in the U.S. for years is just plain wrong. https://t.co/bUX18Zsid2
America has long been a beacon of hope for immigrants who can‚Äôt return to their home countries due to extreme circumstances like war or natural disaster.
I'm going to fight to keep #ruralbroadband a front-burner issue, because it goes beyond partisanship. #Broadband deployment is about keeping our communities strong and making them more competitive in the 21st century economy.
Last wknd I was up in Mountain Iron to talk w/ local leaders &amp; advocates about how to address #broadband issues in Northern MN. W/o access to affordable &amp; reliable high-speed internet, rural businesses, farmers, schools, healthcare providers, &amp; families are put at a disadvantage.
I've been a long-time champion for expanding #ruralbroadband service. If you aren't connected, you aren't competing.
Proud to join @HelpCmteDems and ready to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to be a fierce advocate for children‚Äôs health care. Congress must act now to fund #CHIP
I‚Äôm focused on getting things done for every Minnesotan whose life is affected by decisions made in Washington. That‚Äôs what will guide me when I work with my colleagues, write legislation, debate the toughest issues, and question witnesses and nominees. https://t.co/IlWCdPhzt0
I‚Äôll stand up for the retirees in Duluth who are concerned about their pensions getting cut, the farmer in Willmar concerned about slumping commodity prices, and the local business looking to cut its monthly energy bill.
I‚Äôm eager to fight for the nurse in greater Minnesota who‚Äôs worried about cuts to the rural health budget, the public school teacher who wants to give students a world-class education, and the tribal leader who demands a response to the opioid crisis in Indian Country.
It‚Äôs an honor to serve Minnesota in the U.S. Senate, and I‚Äôm excited that my new committee assignments on @HelpCmteDems, @SenateAgDems, @EnergyDems and @IndianCommittee will allow me to work on issues that touch every community in our state.
#NetNeutrality is the basic‚Äîbut important‚Äîprinciple that what we read, view, &amp; watch on the internet is free &amp; open to everybody. I‚Äôm backing the effort to restore the net neutrality protections that millions of Americans fought to establish. https://t.co/fxHICraKAy
I'm a strong supporter of protecting #NetNeutrality, and I look forward to joining my colleagues in the movement to keep the internet free and open. Minnesota families, small businesses, and schools are counting on it.
Congratulations @melvincarter3 and @Jacob_Frey! I know that Minnesota can count on both of you to move @cityofsaintpaul and @CityMinneapolis forward. https://t.co/QU5C4HKuGZ
Optimism always wins. Today @Vikings invited 99-yr-old Millie Wall, a lifelong fan, to her 1st playoff. That‚Äôs the kind of thing we do in MN. Let‚Äôs #BringItHome this wknd for Millie, &amp; for the millions of #Vikings fans who‚Äôve been waiting for this. #Skol https://t.co/F3raOW2NL5
In less than a week, our very own MN @Vikings will be hosting the New Orleans Saints in a divisional round playoff matchup. Now, in these situations, I recognize that we #Vikings fans traditionally hope for the best and expect the worst‚Äîbut I refuse to do that. And here‚Äôs why.
Thanks to @934AirliftWing and Col. Anthony Polashek for the warm welcome this past weekend. It was great talking with you! And thanks to all of our Global Vikings‚Äîwe‚Äôre so grateful for all you do on behalf of Minnesota.  	https://t.co/vQEb72xvJn
MN is a leader in renewable energy, &amp; for the sake of clean, affordable energy &amp; clean energy jobs, let‚Äôs keep it that way. As #solar power continues to make strides in MN, I‚Äôm going to be fighting for policies that keep us moving in the right direction. https://t.co/VSODIFrr1K

Tomorrow morning I'll be talking about what I want to get done for Minnesota with @ChrisCuomo and Alisyn Camerota on CNN @NewDay. Hope you'll tune in.
I‚Äôll be leading the fight to protect Minnesotans' hard-earned pensions. We must ensure that retirees, like the ones I met in the Northland yesterday, don‚Äôt have the rug pulled out from under them. 	https://t.co/uOEAYoZIyk
Minnesota Steelworkers are an important part of our economy and yesterday I sat down with some of them in Eveleth to hear about issues facing the iron and steel industry. 	https://t.co/npwz2RLyh2 https://t.co/sHzZOCjjcg
This weekend¬†I‚Äôm traveling¬†around the state for the first time as U.S. Senator to talk with Minnesotans about issues that matter to them. Here‚Äôs a snapshot of my travels so¬†far:		https://t.co/tsoVPsTJKX
In a world of innovation, Minnesotans must have access to #broadband, and I‚Äôm going to push for more investment to level that playing field and to make sure that all of Minnesota‚Äôs broadband needs are met. Because if you aren‚Äôt connected, you aren‚Äôt competing.
I‚Äôm in Mountain Iron because I want to hear directly from local leaders and advocates about #broadband issues in northeastern Minnesota, and what steps need to be taken to address them. https://t.co/XylcHYqEvm
High-speed internet access isn‚Äôt a nice thing to have, it‚Äôs a necessary thing to have. Though we have made important progress on the #broadband front, too many Minnesotans‚Äîespecially in rural, tribal, &amp; low-income communities‚Äîstill lack access to reliable &amp; affordable broadband.
This morning I also met with Hibbing Fire Chief Erik Jankila to present him w/ a flag that was flown over the U.S. Capitol Building. This flag is in honor of Steve Gillitzer, a retired Hibbing Dept Captain who passed away while trying to save his family from a house fire in '17. https://t.co/oO580RfkB3
A great morning on the Range! Today I met with Iron Range steelworkers in Eveleth to talk about challenges facing the iron and steel industry. As Senator, I will fight to curb the illegal steel dumping that is hurting too many Northland communities. https://t.co/c1mA16z2YB
When I¬†get¬†back to Washington, I will make a full-court press on protecting people's pensions. We must ensure that Minnesota retirees, like the ones I met today,¬†don‚Äôt have the rug pulled out from under them.
Today in Duluth I met with Sherman Liimatainen, Vice President of the National United Committee to Protect Pensions, and Central States Pension Fund retirees to talk about how we can fix this problem. https://t.co/ZeXPNUeIPs
After decades of hard work, Minnesotans who paid in to a good pension deserve to retire with the peace of mind that they won‚Äôt lose their hard-earned retirement. But right now,¬†problems plaguing our nation‚Äôs pension system¬†threaten to upend that promise.
Tonight I attended a reception to visit with Minnesotans in Duluth &amp; hear what issues they care about. Thanks to everyone who joined me. I‚Äôll be sharing what I've heard tonight with my colleagues in Washington because it‚Äôs my job to make sure MN voices are heard. https://t.co/JARqaWeA4E
Every time I travel across Minnesota, I feel incredible pride‚Äîin our communities and community leaders, in hard-working families, in farmers and businesses, and in all the women, men, and children who call our great state home.
Happy 90th Birthday to my friend Vice President Walter Mondale. Fritz ‚Äì it was an honor to have you accompany me to my swearing-in ceremony. As Senator, I‚Äôm committed to upholding the progressive legacy set by leaders like you. https://t.co/A9Af0kac2x
As Senator, I‚Äôm going to lead the fight in tackling the #skillsgap to help strengthen our workforce, create more good-paying jobs, and maintain our country‚Äôs competitiveness.
Today I‚Äôm at @WyomingMachine, a sheet metal company owned by 2 sisters in Stacy, MN. I'm meeting w/ the business‚Äô owners, Lori &amp; Traci Tapani, as well as local educators &amp; workforce development experts to discuss MN‚Äôs workforce shortages &amp; efforts needed to address #skillsgap. https://t.co/ta43AODnOE
Our nation‚Äôs #skillsgap has left employers in Minnesota and across the country with millions of good-paying jobs they can‚Äôt fill because they can‚Äôt find enough trained workers. https://t.co/k25MBNm3wW
Do you live near Duluth? If so, I hope to see you at a reception I‚Äôm attending with Duluth Mayor Emily Larson at @hoopsbrewing. RSVP: https://t.co/2OfqPs54rY

I‚Äôll also be attending two free, open-to-the-public community receptions to meet Minnesotans in Duluth and the Twin Cities. I hope you‚Äôll be able to join me. Here‚Äôs how you sign up: Minneapolis: https://t.co/46Uj1vRzLc Duluth: https://t.co/wBEMUOEv53.
We got some beautiful snow in Washington today, which is getting me excited for MN this weekend. Starting tomorrow, I‚Äôll be traveling from the Twin Cities up to Northern MN to meet w/ local leaders, workers, business owners, and families and talk about the issues they care about.
It was an honor to be sworn in to the United States Senate yesterday, and now it‚Äôs time to get to work.
And on Saturday, I‚Äôm hosting a reception in the Twin Cities, which is also free and open to the public. I hope you‚Äôll be able to join me. https://t.co/736ZgSWCqd
This Friday, I will take part in a reception in Duluth, which is free and open to the public. https://t.co/2OfqPs54rY
I‚Äôm looking forward to traveling across our state as a U.S. Senator to talk with, learn from, and work on behalf of Minnesotans.
Thank you to the people of MN. In my new job as Senator I promise to advocate fiercely for you, your families, and the issues you care about. I can't wait to get to work. https://t.co/X6otomuMFJ https://t.co/VOTxqrS0HM
Today, I'll be sworn in to the United States Senate. I'm looking forward to continuing to be a fierce advocate for Minnesotans, and carrying on the progressive legacy of this seat. I hope you'll follow along here, because I'm ready to get to work.
