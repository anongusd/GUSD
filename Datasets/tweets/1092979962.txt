Put simply, leaders don‚Äôt just shut down the government or declare a national emergency any time they disagree with Congress.
And while I‚Äôm encouraged Congress was able to come together, I‚Äôm concerned w/ POTUS' reported plans to declare a national emergency to build an ineffective, costly border wall he said Mexico would pay for. He's breaking a signature promise &amp; he‚Äôs setting a dangerous precedent.
Today‚Äôs bipartisan agreement achieves two important goals ‚Äì it keeps our government open and takes critical, effective steps to secure our borders. While the bill isn‚Äôt perfect, both sides had to meet in the middle and that‚Äôs how governing ought to work. It's what folks expect.
Farmer bankruptcies are the highest they've been in at least a decade. Where I come from, President Trump's trade war is the real national emergency. Watch more on @MeetThePress: https://t.co/Oq7DLpr7Ft

The president spoke at length about bridging divides and healing wounds. I hope these weren‚Äôt just lines in a speech ‚Äì but that he will stick to his word to find common ground and avoid another government shutdown in the coming weeks. #SOTU
And people with pre-existing conditions cannot ‚Äòchoose greatness‚Äô when Washington Republicans continue working to rip away their critical patient protections. #ProtectOurCare #SOTU
However, the families we serve deserve real solutions ‚Äì not just soundbites. Farmers cannot ‚Äòchoose greatness‚Äô when the president‚Äôs #tradewar is eliminating the very markets where they need to sell their goods. #SOTU
I‚Äôm also hopeful we can work together to bring down the cost of prescription drugs for seniors and families and, as the president proposed, make meaningful investments to fight conditions such as childhood cancer. #SOTU

That's just not right. Instead, we should be fighting for policies that open markets for our farmers and reward their hard work ‚Äì not hinder it. As a member of @HouseAgDems since I first came to Congress, I've always been a strong voice for our family farmers.
Soybean farmers across Illinois have felt the impacts of this trade war on their bottom lines. Tom said it best when he stated, ‚Äúthe reckless trade policies coming from the White House seriously threaten the future of family farms like mine.‚Äù

Today I celebrated the life and legacy of #DrMartinLutherKingJr. with the Rockford community. I hope this celebration of his life reminds us that together we can overcome any challenges, because ‚Äúthe arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice‚Äù. https://t.co/H6mlqQAscx
On #MartinLutherKingJrDay we honor a man who put his faith into action and organized with a message of hope, love &amp; brotherhood. Although we still have a lot of work ahead to realize his dream, he taught us that when we unite under a banner of peace, we can change the world. https://t.co/u7QmCLFeeU
Nobody should have to work w/o pay‚Äîbut that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening for TSA workers at Rockford‚Äôs airport due to this shutdown. It‚Äôs wrong and it‚Äôs hurting families. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/P1qh1NgMqt
Stopped at a supermarket in Rockford today. Folks are ready to #EndTheShutdown so we can make progress on the kitchen table issues they care about‚Äîbringing down the cost of health care and investing in our infrastructure. https://t.co/clPqUQpwjV

But because of the shutdown, the USDA program they planned to use to make this expansion has been put on hold. I‚Äôve voted 9 times to #EndTheShutdown ‚Äî time for Mitch McConnell to take up our bills and open the government.

This week, I received a note from Ray in Knoxville, IL that truly shines a light on how the shutdown is hurting brave men and women who‚Äôve put their life on the line for our country. POTUS &amp; @senatemajldr McConnell can take up our bills to #EndTheShutdown now! https://t.co/5tZkQQORWI

Since I was elected to office, I promised families across Central &amp; Northwest Illinois that I would be their voice in Washington.

This shutdown might be a stubborn game of chicken for the White House, but hardworking families across our region know that this is no way to govern ‚Äì we must put the shutdown to an end. #EndTheShutdown #TrumpShutdown
And by prolonging this shutdown and rejecting bill after bill to fund our government, the president is making us less safe by not paying our border patrol and TSA agents.
This weekend, I spoke with a TSA agent who has no other choice but to dip into her wedding savings to make ends meet. She deserves better than this!
People in Illinois are hurting because of the shutdown ‚Äì farmers are facing more uncertainty without the trade assistance they were promised by POTUS and too many Illinoisans aren‚Äôt getting their paychecks in the mail.
#TrumpShutdown thread ‚Üí This month, @HouseDemocrats have voted for 7 different funding bills to keep folks safe, end the shutdown &amp; reopen our govt. Despite previous broad bipartisan support, Mitch McConnell &amp; the WH are holding these bills hostage to score political points.
This unnecessary shutdown has created hardship for too many families, and we owe it to the American people to do everything we can to mitigate the damage and #EndTheShutdown.
More than 7,000 federal workers across IL don‚Äôt know how they‚Äôre going to pay rent or put food on the table, let alone make student loan payments. That's why I joined @RepBonamici &amp; called on @BetsyDeVos to help student loan borrowers hurt by the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/W7CkFe4Wwt
With the passage of this bill, all American flags purchased with taxpayer money will be American-made to ensure that the symbol of our nation is preserved while supporting American jobs and manufacturing. Hopeful the Senate will move on this bill &amp; get it to POTUS' desk.
He informed me that the American flag in the corner of the room could have been made overseas, and that he went into the service to fight for the USA, not China. Since that conversation, I have worked across the aisle to require the DOD to purchase American-made flags.
Today, the House passed my bipartisan bill that requires all American flags purchased by the federal government to be made in the U.S. &amp; from materials grown or produced in our country. This idea came from a Vietnam veteran in Moline. https://t.co/YDq72X5IaW
Edward wrote how hard the shutdown has been on agriculture. Our ag producers already face a tough farm economy ‚Äì and w/ POTUS‚Äô trade war it‚Äôs only gotten worse. This shutdown is causing even MORE uncertainty. Time to end the #TrumpShutdown.

The lives of far too many across our region have been impacted by the #TrumpShutdown ‚Äì time to open the govt. so the Ag Lab can continue advancing research that drives American agriculture and our economy.

With this committee assignment, I plan to help cut through red tape, rein in wasteful spending and make government work for the people of our region again. Read more below: 	https://t.co/fKMIH1vgsF
To renew the promise of our region, one of my top priorities will be major investments in our infrastructure. We also need to work harder to meet the needs of rural hospitals that provide critical care while funding ag. priorities like the research at the Peoria Agriculture Lab.
Today, I am pleased to announce that I was appointed to serve on the House Appropriations Committee, which will allow me to better advocate for Illinois families‚Äì ensuring the needs of our region are being met and properly funded by the federal government.

Folks from every corner of the district have reached out to share their deep concerns over partisan attacks on affordable health care, which is why I helped pass legislation today to protect Illinoisans with pre-existing conditions.
I will continue putting our families first and work with anyone, and everyone, willing to put this shutdown to an end. https://t.co/mqLNGlKrAq
Today I voted to fund the Department of Treasury and the IRS to ensure that Illinoisans receive their tax returns on time, so that small businesses can get the support they need to grow our local economy and to ensure consumer protections can be carried out.
Illinois families sent me to Washington to fight for them, and it is my job to ensure that their financial security does not fall victim to President Trump‚Äôs reckless shutdown.
On #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay, I want to recognize the brave men and women who work tirelessly to keep our communities safe. A very special thank you to my husband, Gerry, who has served the Quad-Cities for more than 3 decades. You make me so proud. https://t.co/zTggUf6ghT

While the White House has threatened to keep the government shut down for ‚Äòyears,‚Äô I‚Äôll work with anyone to end this reckless shutdown and honor our commitment to keep communities safe. #TrumpShutdown
This is just plain wrong. For 18 days, the president has refused to sign bipartisan legislation to open the government and fund effective, fiscally responsible measures to secure our borders. #TrumpShutdown
Hardworking families are hurting because of President Trump‚Äôs impulsive decision to shut down the government ‚Äì farmers, airport security officials and workers at the Peoria Agriculture Lab are being used as pawns in a partisan fight they had nothing to do with. #TrumpShutdown
Farmers can‚Äôt be used as bargaining chips in the #TrumpShutdown. They already face a tough farm economy &amp; damage from POTUS‚Äô trade war. Time to end the partisan games and open the government. #ForThePeople 	https://t.co/XdHX0G81lq

From making sure small towns get fair relief from FEMA to passing a Farm Bill that ensures rural communities have the resources they need to combat the opioid epidemic, I am proud of the progress we have made across our region to better the lives of Illinoisans.
Illinoisans sent me to Congress to fight for them, not to play partisan games. My top priorities remain the issues I hear about from folks in the supermarket ‚Äì making health care affordable, investing in our infrastructure &amp; stomping out corruption in DC. https://t.co/KqGCE4F114

It‚Äôs time to make sure our government is working #ForThePeople.
It‚Äôs my job to ensure your concerns are heard in Washington, which is why our first votes in the new House majority were to end the shutdown and for a new set of rules that will make the House advance common sense bipartisan solutions and govern more effectively.
While walking the aisles of Aldi in Moline today, I continued to hear frustrations over why Congress can't seem to get anything done. https://t.co/Vzpt6H6yAk
With 800,000 federal workers furloughed or working w/o pay -- incl. at our airports &amp; the Peoria Ag Lab -- the Trump Admin. is preparing to dole out raises for senior officials that are 1/4 of what the average person makes in our region. This is absurd!	https://t.co/7sIc5BVRDl

Finally, it‚Äôs time for Congress to live within its means ‚Äì just like Illinoisans do every single day. Any new spending must be offset with cuts or new revenue. Time to govern responsibly and #ForThePeople.
No more taxpayer funded settlements for Members of Congress who‚Äôve sexually harassed or discriminated against staff. Those days are over. #ForThePeople
We‚Äôre also going to deliver results for American families by ensuring commonsense bipartisan bills w/ 290 cosponsors have the chance to be voted on while looking at how we can modernize Congress to work more effectively.
.@HouseDemocrats 1st order of business was making the House more effective &amp; accountable. This package ensures we govern with integrity by making Members of Congress &amp; staff attend ethics training &amp; preventing them from serving on corporate boards. #ForThePeople

This is false-We already have fencing &amp; barriers along parts of the border. I support common sense and effective means to secure the border. We must negotiate to end the #TrumpShutdown but not by giving the President a costly &amp; ineffective taxpayer-funded wall for political cover https://t.co/q8kkFuINHp
Up next on @NewDay CNN ‚Äî tune in!
As experts have long said, we ought to invest in 21st century solutions to secure the border ‚Äì not an outdated, ineffective and fiscally irresponsible wall as the President has proposed.
As the wife of a Sheriff, I know we must keep our communities safe ‚Äì I‚Äôve always supported both comprehensive immigration reform &amp; effective strategies to secure our borders. But w/ the #TrumpShutdown, border patrol agents aren‚Äôt being paid for their work ‚Äì that‚Äôs just wrong!
Two weeks ago, there was a bipartisan consensus to fund the government that *every single Senator* agreed to ‚Äì nearly identical to the legislation we passed today ‚Äì and I hope they will work with us in good faith to end the shutdown.
The President cannot tweet his way out of the shutdown ‚Äì he needs to work w/ both parties to find solutions. And while he continues to sow chaos at the expense of ordinary Americans, we are committed to governing responsibly #ForThePeople &amp; leading our country out of this mess.
FBI agents, border patrol officers and airport security officials shouldn‚Äôt have to go to work and wonder if they can make next month‚Äôs rent. They deserve better!
Right now, there are 800K hardworking men &amp; women either furloughed or working w/o pay because POTUS &amp; Washington Republicans chose to play political games rather than fulfill their basic responsibility to keep the govt. functioning. Families are hurting because of this.
BREAKING: The new House Democratic majority just took immediate action to end the #TrumpShutdown and bring this needless stunt to an end.

Americans deserve better than relentless dysfunction &amp; politicians who are more interested in scoring political points than executing the basic functions of government. I'll continue working to bring both sides together to bring the shutdown to an end as quickly as possible.
Let‚Äôs be clear ‚Äì this government shutdown, driven by House Republicans and the president, was completely avoidable. Washington‚Äôs constant culture of failure and ineffectiveness was on full display this week ‚Äì and families across the Heartland are understandably frustrated.
I was excited to hear that the International Women‚Äôs Baseball Center is planning memorialize Penny Marshall, the late director who put our amazing Rockford Peaches on the map!

4: The freedom of the press is enshrined in the 1st Amendment because our founding fathers recognized that we couldn't have a successful &amp; thriving democracy without a #FreePress there to hold the government accountable to the people. That's the opposite of the #EnemyofthePeople
3: Reporters work very hard, frequently around the clock, to inform the public about what's happening in our world, our country &amp; in local communities across America. It's often thankless work, but they deserve our respect and appreciation- especially when we don't like the news!
2: In an era when we have a White House that routinely deceives the public and claims anything that doesn't shower @realDonaldTrump with praise is just #FakeNews, it's NEVER been more important to have good reporters who dig deep and get the facts out to the public.

This is a defining moment in our nation‚Äôs history and we, as Democrats, will stand up and demand #ABetterDeal for the American people rooted in creating better jobs, ensuring better wages and delivering a better future for all of our families.
On factory floors, in grocery store aisles and at kitchen tables, families will have to make ends meet after Washington Republicans raised their taxes, healthcare costs, and the national debt all to pay for a tax break for billionaires and corporate special interests. #TaxScam
@realDonaldTrump I said I would be open to tax reform that puts hardworking families first. This bill does anything but.		I've heard from hundreds of men and women in rural America who are scared about how they'll afford to pay their bills after this #TaxScam becomes law.
The first bill I introduced this Congress called on @realDonaldTrump to release a plan to end the outsourcing of good American jobs.		But Washington Republicans delivered a gut punch to hardworking families by raising their taxes &amp; making it easier to ship jobs overseas #TaxScam
Washington Republicans are voting on their #TaxScam bill today. But it‚Äôs a broken promise.		It raises taxes on 86 million middle-class households.		And it‚Äôs a job killer that will help big corporations move jobs overseas.		Watch my floor speech to find out more: https://t.co/nNsDrTLo4B

Agree! This is part of the #MeTooCongress Act which I strongly support. However, taxpayers have already foot the bill for about $17 million in settlements since the 90's w/ no real transparency.

It's pretty simple - If a member of Congress is going to settle a sexual harassment claim, taxpayers should have the right to know about it since they‚Äôre the ones footing the bill.
