We hope everyone enjoyed The Ag Downturn. The talk has been recorded and we will share once it becomes available.
Henderson in response to a Q: inflation is like driving your car really fast and letting the RPMs run high - eventually it will break
Mintert: this is a huge opportunity for a land-grant university to make a difference
@PurdueExtension @PUCommercialAg has many financial management tools available
@PurdueExtension @PUCommercialAg provides a lot of webinars
@PurdueExtension Seeding rates, nitrogen rates, weed control, cost control
@PurdueExtension you can rely on research-based management strategies
So how can #PurdueExtension help?
@PurdueExtension especially true for adopting new technology
Boehlje: very important - you have to have the agility to be able to take advantage of these opportunities
Boehlje: you almost always have the opportunity to buy new assets during a downturn
@PurdueExtension expansion, land improvements, diversify
Boehlje: in downturns, there ARE opportunities
@PurdueExtension bankers have to get ahead of the power curve - help refinance them before there is a big problem
Boehlje: refinancing or restructuring debt will help in many cases
Boehlje: projections show ongoing lack of profitability
@PurdueExtension We tell farmers the most important thing they can do is lower the price of cash rented land
@PurdueExtension the more cash rented land there is, the more problems there will be
Boehlje: the demographic that we're most concerned about are the people who are renting farmland
@PurdueExtension if we don't have the people, we have really got to increase our labor force productivity
Henderson: If boomers are retiring, how many people do we have that are ready and eligible to work?
Henderson: The rhythms we're experiencing today are very similar to what we've seen in the past
Henderson: What drives interest rates higher? - Too much money chasing too few goods
Interest rate adjustment https://t.co/UxdQUsbarb
Henderson: the speed of adjustment is similar to a football team - speed kills
Henderson: What does trade look like going forward?
Henderson: when we look at Ag cycles there are good outcomes, bad outcomes, and the ugly outcomes
Henderson: Farm debt was the challenge in the 1980s
Mike Boehlje, professor @PurdueAgEcon: I'm concerned about the dollar increase, but the wipeout of the trade war shouldn't be ignored
Henderson: I'm more worried about the value of the dollar vs. the trade war
@PurdueExtension it's really key to talk and think about exports over the next decade
@PurdueExtension the ugly was the 1930s
@PurdueExtension 1980s were the bad because of debt
@PurdueExtension 1950s and 1960s were the good
@PurdueExtension the second is solvency crisis, or bankruptcy: debt, inflation, and interest rates
@PurdueExtension the first is liquidity cost, or cash crunch: demand, exports, and exchange rates
Jason Henderson, director of #PurdueExtension: Ag downturns have two components
Mintert on beef production: cost of production is lowering, but not fast enough to level out with beef prices
Mintert: we currently export roughly 20% of pork produced - a big increase to several years ago
Mintert shifting to animal agriculture: farrow-to-finish operations will struggle to break even in 2017
Mintert: Large-scale farmers are beginning to show more interest in diversified farming
Mintert: As crop farming became more profitable, cash rents began increasing around 2012
Mintert: the challenge our producers are facing is revenue is lower than total cost of production
Jim Mintert, one of our speakers today, is the director for the @PUCommercialAg https://t.co/SYNM5XRBfc
Mintert: once you pull acreage into production, it's difficult to pull it out of production
Mintert: we're between $3.50-$4.00 a bushel and that's just the reality of it

Our @USDA Crop Production Report analysis is over, but stay tuned for exclusive videos with our @PurdueAg experts! #cropreport16
.@JayAkridge: We're looking at 2nd biggest IN corn crop &amp; biggest soybean crop. Testament to IN farmers' management. Nxt 30-35 days are key.
Nielsen on gray leaf spot in #corn: at this stage, it's not cost-effective to treat this disease, which may worsen w/ current weather.
Hurt: Reason we're looking at such high revenue boost w 2016 Indiana crop is because state was hit so hard by flooding last year.
Hurt: 2016 Indiana corn &amp; soybean crop could bring in an additional $650 million to state, split ~ evenly between corn &amp; soy. #cropreport16
Hurt: Indiana #soybean production up 14% from 2015, slight drop in price. Revenue up 13%.
Hurt: Indiana #corn production up 28% over 2015, price drop of ~13%. Revenue up 11% vs. 2015 crop, which was hard-hit with floods.
This increase speaks to "absolutely remarkable" developments in agricultural sciences over last decade.
Hurt: This national corn forecast--15 billion bushels--is a 50% expansion over a 10-year horizon.
3) "I can't remember, but it's something about this being a big crop!"
.@PurdueAgEcon's Chris Hurt: There are 3 things to remember w these @USDA numbers. 1) This is a big crop. 2) This is a BIG crop....
Casteel: Historically, these Indiana soybean numbers--55 bu/acre-- are about 9% above yield trend. But it's all about the next 30-35 days.
"I get a little worried about the height of these soybeans. That's a lot of biomass to maintain." Will need enough moisture to finish well.
.@PurdueExtension's Shaun Casteel (@CasteelCorner) on Indiana soybeans: "Soybeans are now up to my chest, and I'm 6 foot 4."
"I'm a little surprised how high some of these estimates are. But it's not over til it's over, &amp; they're certainly not without precedent."
Nielsen:  "I'm curious how this will shake out. These warmer conditions might take some of the frosting off the top of these yields."
Areas of NE Indiana are dry, could be some yield losses. Current warm, muggy weather does not favor max yield.
Nielsen: Crop condition ratings are high, 13% above trend for Indiana estimates, comparable to 2013, 2014. Relatively disease-free.
.@PurdueExtension's Bob Nielsen (@PurdueCornGuy): Indiana corn crop got off to pretty good start. May/June drier, which bodes well for roots
Indiana #soybean estimates are 312 million bushels, 55 bu/acre. That's half bu below record set in 2014. #cropreport16
Matli: Looking at Indiana #corn numbers, 1.049 billion bushels predicted, 187 bu/acre. That's 1 bu below record set in 2014. #cropreport16
Matli: Soybeans shaping up into record crop as well. Forecast US production of 4.06 billion bushels, 48.9 bu/acre.
This is up 11% from corn production last year. 2016 = 175.1 bu/acre.
Greg Matli of @usda_nass: "Got some big numbers this year." Corn crop forecast to hit 15.2 billion bushels. Would be record.  #cropreport16
.@JayAkridge now kicking off @PurdueAg &amp; @PurdueExtension expert analysis of @USDA Crop Production Report. #cropreport16

.@PurdueExtension panel has concluded. Summary news release forthcoming from @Ag_Answers. #CropReport15
Wickard: Farmers in need of emergency loans should visit county Farm Service Agency office. More info: http://t.co/EhsGLpfnWx #CropReport15
Wickard: 53 Indiana counties approved for federal disaster assistance via low-interest emergency loans. #CropReport15
Nielsen provides more corn-specific information and updates for growers via @PurdueCornGuy.
Hurt: "Good weather could trim the losses. These numbers could change." #CropReport15
Nielsen: Hybrids helped. If we were using corn varieties of 30 years ago, "losses would have been much more dramatic." #CropReport15
Hurt: 2/3 of Indiana counties stand to get some @usdafsa government program payments. Average is $25-30 per acre. #CropReport15
Hurt: Insurance could provide $250-300 million in recovery (says this is a "wild guess"). #CropReport15
Hurt: However, crops can be insured only up to 85%. Still looking at some losses. Hard to estimate what losses will be. #CropReport15
Hurt: $400 million estimated loss in crop value will be offset by crop insurance. ~80% Indiana corn/soybean acreage covered. #CropReport15
McKinney: Indiana is #2 in total cover crop acreage in U.S., second only to Texas. "We should be very proud of that." #CropReport15
McKinney anticipates some tiling for saturated fields. Encourages farmers to provide feedback to @usdafsa. #CropReport15
McKinney: Possible point of encouragement is that global demand for protein is still up &amp; Midwest offers all kinds of protein. #CropReport15
Ted McKinney, director of Indiana State Department of Ag: "It's our turn in the barrel. Unfortunately, it was a water barrel." #CropReport15
Hurt: "It's not over yet in terms of acreage and not over in terms of yields." #CropReport15
Hurt: Yield is down, but not as bad as expected for Eastern Corn Belt. Western Corn Belt has a "very, very good crop." #CropReport15
Hurt estimates lost value for Indiana corn at $290 million. $110 million for soybean. These do not reflect economic impact. #CropReport15
Hurt: Price for soybean was $13/bushel in 2013, $10 in 2014, estimated $9.15/bu in 2015. Corn $4.46/bu in 2013, $3.70 in '14, $3.65 in 2015.
Hurt: Some farm families will be facing financial concerns. Incomes good through 2013 crop, transition to lower returns in '14 #CropReport15
.@PurdueExtension ag economist Chris Hurt estimates 8% reduction in Indiana corn yield, 4% reduction in soybean yield. #CropReport15
Casteel: "It's been the year of the have's and have not's." Yields varying across state. Watch out for sudden death syndrome. #CropReport15
Casteel: Pod size may be down, but seed size could be larger, make up ground in final yields. #CropReport15
Casteel: Growers may be disappointed by short soybeans, but "you don't have to have tall beans for tall yields."#CropReport15
Casteel's yield trend was 49.8 bu/acre. @USDA estimate = 49 bu/acre, a "very minimal reduction in terms of overall forecast." #CropReport15
.@PurdueExtension soybean specialist Shaun Casteel: Extremely saturated fields in June led to nitrogen stress in many soybeans.#CropReport15
Nielsen: Hard year for flooded fields, but statewide we're clearly in better shape than we were in 2012. #CropReport15
Nielsen: Even fields not damaged by floods could face nitrogen loss, deficiency. Also, walk fields for ear rots, mycotoxins. #CropReport15
Nielsen: Big challenge ahead to get all corn dried down in uniform way for storability. #CropReport15
Nielsen: "Clearly we need a warm, sunny September, October to allow corn to mature," dry down. #CropReport15
Nielsen: Crop statewide should mature in a normal timeframe. Big difference from 2009 late-maturity crop. #CropReport15
Nielsen: Reduction in yield is "clearly not uniform in distribution." Some fields have best corn ever; others "total disaster."#CropReport15
.@PurdueExtension corn specialist Bob Nielsen: "This 158 [bushel/acre] is clearly in the ballpark" compared to yearly trends. #CropReport15
Wickard: Assistance would be in form of low-interest loans. @usdafsa "doors are open." #CropReport15
Julia Wickard, state executive director of @usdafsa, said 53 Indiana counties approved for disaster assistance today. #CropReport15
Matli: Indiana soybean production at 278.8 million bushels, 49 bu/acre, down from 307.4 million bushels in 2014, 56 bu/acre #CropReport15
Matli: Indiana corn production at 867.42 million bushels, 158 bu/acre. 47% crop in good to excellent condition vs 70% in US. #CropReport15
Matli: States expecting record soybean yield include Arkansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota, Virginia.#CropReport15
Matli: 10 states expecting record yield for corn, including Iowa, Michigan, Minn, Neb, South Dakota, Wisconsin. #CropReport15
Matli: U.S. soybean production at 3.92 billion bushels, down 1% from 2014. Yield 46.9 bu/acre, record area for harvest. #CropReport15
Matli: U.S. corn production at 13.7 billion bushels, down 4% from 2014 record. Yield 168.8 bu/acre.Would be 2nd highest yield. #CropReport15
Greg Matli, IN state statistician for @USDA kicks off analysis. Stats based on farmer surveys, satellite data. #CropReport15
Akridge: Yield off in state, but a lot of variability by county. #CropReport15
Akridge: Tough season for farmers &amp; wettest year in Indiana's history. About 25% corn &amp; soybeans in poor/very poor condition. #CropReport15

Cain: It's really going to be up to communities to recover. @PurdueExtension is lending a hand &amp; available to help. Contact Cain #INfloods15
Cain: No way we are going to get FEMA assistance for this year's flooding. #INfloods15
.@EDENtweets disaster specialist Steve Cain: Flooding recovery resources available at http://t.co/styMLddn2i #INfloods15
Kladivko: Producers can use local @USDA_NRCS offices. #INfloods15
Kladivko: More resources from http://t.co/DyZqnnDPuT &amp; Midwest Cover Crops Council: http://t.co/YGdCCKJnMM #INfloods15
Kladivko: Cover crops can retain nutrients, help soil biological activity. Tools for selecting cover crops available from @USDA_NRCS, MCCC
.@PurdueAgronomy's Eileen Kladivko: Bad situation to leave fields bare, fallow for growing season. Cover crops good option. #INfloods15
Camberato on nitrogen: Shorter corn = sidedressing an option. Taller corn will require box spreaders, high clearance tractors. #INfloods15
Camberato: Nitrogen can double corn yield, but is expensive ($100/acre) and mobile (escapes into atmosphere and into water). #INfloods15
Jim Camberato: Corn growers need to assess nitrogen losses and consider supplemental application. #INfloods15
Wise: Humidity = great conditions for northern corn leaf blight, lesions. Scout prior to tasseling &amp; in late vegetation. #INfloods15
Wise: Watch for white mold in northern part of the state. Consider value/cost of fungicide. #INfloods15
Kiersten Wise: Seedling blight problem in soybeans. Wet conditions raise chances for sudden death syndrome. #INfloods15
Krupke: We've never extensively planted soybeans in July. We don't know what will happen w/ soybean aphid in that situation. #INfloods15
.@PurdueInsects Christian Krupke: Corn rootworms drown before crops will. Most rootworms will have been killed after emergence. #INfloods15
Johnson: "Off-label" herbicide risks--poor spray coverage, poor control because weeds are too big, risk of impact on ear fill. #INfloods15
Weed scientist Bill Johnson: As soon as fields dry, producers need to manage weeds. Challenge is crop/weed stages are similar. #INfloods15
Keith Johnson: Make sure soil is dry enough to handle harvesting equipment. #INfloods15
.@PurdueAg's Keith Johnson on forages: Producers need to check temperature of stored forages to avoid fires. +150 deg = danger. #INfloods15
Langemeier: See Purdue Center for Commercial Agriculture's website for good publications on crop insurance options. #INfloods15
Hurt on crop prices: Corn at 30 cents/bushel, soybeans at 80 cents/bushel. "The market has taken note." #INfloods15
Hurt to producers: "Don't give up on this crop. We never know what the next week or month will hold." #INfloods15
Nielsen on corn maturation &amp; weather: "We need some bright, sunny days to get these photosynthetic factories up and running." #INfloods15
Nielsen: Challenging decisions ahead for corn growers on sidedressing nitrogen, herbicides and disease control. #INfloods15
Casteel: Central part of IN: shorter season planting up to July 4. Backdating from frost, planting by July 10/16. "It's a roll of the dice."
Casteel: Northern 1/3 of state: shortening up varieties that we have. Mark fall freeze date for area and backdate. #INfloods15
Casteel: Coming to point where a lot of soybean fields are going to be nitrogen deprived due to saturation. #INfloods15
Casteel: Planting conditions were marginal for soybeans. Sidewall compactions, restricted root systems. Rain helped roots. #INfloods15
Nielsen: More articles on corn available at "Chat 'n Chew Cafe" online. #INfloods15
Nielsen: Too late to replant corn in northern IN. Longer growing season in south makes replanting viable option for that area. #INfloods15
Nielsen: More heavy rain could tip some areas over edge. If we can avoid excessive rains, a lot of fields could come out of this.#INfloods15
Nielsen: Rain deteriorates corn root system. We've got hundreds of overwatered "houseplants" in state. #INfloods15
Nielsen: Number of acres affected this year ranks among the most I've seen in +30 years. Yield potential difficult to predict. #INfloods15
Nielsen: "What is different about this year is the magnitude." Several 1000 acres likely affected by this year's heavy rainfall. #INfloods15
Update on corn and soybean w/ corn specialist Bob Nielsen @PurdueCornGuy and soybean specialist Shaun Casteel @CasteelCorner. #INfloods15

Scheeringa: The warmer temperatures in June will flip to cooler than normal temps for next month or longer. #INfloods15
Scheeringa: Rising concern is will there be enough heat &amp; growing degree days to bring crops to maturity &amp; finish out season? #INfloods15
More from Scheeringa on weather outlook: Cooler than normal temps, above normal rain predicted. Could be "long-term tendency." #INfloods15
Coming up at 10 AM: corn and soybean crop update. 10:30: forages, soil nutrients, pest control, cover crops, disaster resources. #INfloods15
Hurt: Total impacts on corn and soybeans could have $200-300 mill impact on state. #INfloods15
Hurt: IN soybean crop rank as of June 7 was 84 percentile, down to 44 percentile by June 21. #INfloods15
Hurt: $100 mill impact on corn at this point. #INfloods15
Hurt: IN corn yield estimates fell 9.6 bushels/acre since June 7. "This was a very devastating period." #INfloods15
Hurt: 2015 IN crop rank as of June 7 was 75 percentile, by June 21 fell to 35 percentile. "Very discouraging, well below normal. #INfloods15
Hurt: Higher costs = replacing nitrogen losses and replanting. #INfloods15
Hurt: Lower yields, but some compensation in form of higher prices. Crop insurance indemnities could be important.  #INfloods15
Hurt: 4% of corn and soybeans and 2% of wheat in "very poor" category. #INfloods15
.@PurdueAgEcon's Chris Hurt: "We don't know how much total damage there will be." #INfloods15
Langemeier: When deciding which option, consider "what are add'l costs, and what is add'l revenue." #INfloods15
Langemeier: If crop already planted, "leave damaged crop as is." If not planted, go ahead and plant. Or plant alternative crop. #INfloods15
Langemeier: Insured acres not planted at end of late plntg period bc of insurable causes can be insured at prevented plntng coverage level.
Langemeier: Late planting coverage--coverage reduced 1% per day for each of 25 days in late planting period, like a "penalty." #INfloods15
Langemeier: 2015 crop budgets showed negative BEFORE flooding. "It's going to be even worse." #INfloods15
Langemeier: 81% of corn acreage &amp; 83% of soybean insured in 2014. Likely similar in 2015. #INfloods15
Next speaker is @PurdueAgEcon's Michael Langemeier, discussing crop insurance options. #INfloods15
Wickard: If farmers are in failed acreage situation, please see county FSA office. #INfloods15
Wickard: We may accept late-filed Prevented Planning req if approved  w/ crop advisors. #INfloods15
Wickard: Flooding may impact 2015 price loss coverage payments, "safety net" outlined in 2014 Farm Bill. #INfloods15
Wickard: If Secretarial Disaster Desig Process is filed/approved, emergency loans could be available to farmers. #INfloods15
Wickard: FSA at county offices completing loss assessment reports. #INfloods15
Wickard: State has not yet filed Secretarial Disaster Designation Process, still collecting data. #INfloods15
USDA Julia Wickard (@cowbarngirl): "Floods have left extensive damage and heartache behind." #INfloods15
Scheeringa: Next 8-14 day outlook predicts "good chance for above normal rainfall." #INfloods15
Scheeringa: S IN saw heavy rainfall due to Tropical Storm Bill from Louisiana. #INfloods15
Scheeringa: How did we get to this condition? Storms pounded N IN as they moved around "Bermuda High," roadblock to rain in S IN #INfloods15
Scheeringa: A corner of NW Indiana had more than 12 in of rain, some areas +16 in. State has had above-normal rainfall. #INfloods15
Scheeringa: only ~ 4 days in June without rain somewhere in Indiana. #INfloods15

Purdue News - Abundant corn, soybean crops expected again in Indiana, nation - http://t.co/T2fhdn8CNu      #Purdue
Panel on #CropReport14 has concluded. For the #Purdue news release, please visit http://t.co/gpXA8xQbtk.
Indiana soybean numbers: 51 bushels/acre, same as 2013. Total production is almost 280 million bushels, 3rd largest soybean crop for state.
U.S. soybean numbers: 45.4 bushels/acre, total production is a record 3.82 billion bushels, up 16% from last year.
Indiana corn numbers: a record 179 bushels/acre, up from 177 bu/acre in 2013. 1.04 billion bushels in total production.
U.S. corn numbers: Corn yield is 167.4 bushels/acre. Total corn production at about 14 billion bushels (up 1% from '13).
Akridge: Levels of profitability for livestock farmers that they haven't seen in a while. Bumper crop for corn possible.
Nielsen: Hybrids continue to push yield potential, withstand stress better than previous decades. Potential to keep "ramping up" yields.
Hurt: This report does not take us to new crop price lows. Trade may be banking on bigger crop than projected.
Hurt: Land values may moderately decrease, i.e. by 15%. Most farm families will be able to adjust w change in strategies.
Hurt: Cash rent farmers may be under stress this year, may be tightening belts, using machinery they already have.
Hurt: Input costs steady. Nitrogen may move with crop prices. Seed costs may decrease. Land values up, cash rents up in Indiana from 2013.
McKinney: Livestock sector in Indiana improving, may also be helped by lower feedstock costs.
Ted McKinney, director of Indiana State Dept of Ag: Crop not yet in bin. Good news on yield, bad news on profitability.
Hurt: Crop farmers looking for safety net against low prices can sign up for federal gov't farm program this fall.
Hurt: Crop margins for Indiana could drop 25-30% compared with 2013.
Hurt: Soybean crop trade estimates on par with #CropReport14.
Hurt: Could see yield estimates rise during fall due to cool season.
Hurt: Trade expected higher corn yield than 167.4 bu/acre in U.S.
Chris Hurt, #Purdue prof of ag economics: Decreases in prices likely with these crops. Good yields will depress prices across U.S.
Casteel: Soybeans 7-10 days ahead of 5-yr average in development. Need to finish developing pods. Larger seeds likely. 35-45 days left.
Shaun Casteel, #Purdue Extension soybean specialist: rough start to season with rain and herbicide damage, but past mid-May, crop improved.
Nielsen: Minimal risk of "harvest full of headaches," but we need normal or above normal temps to finish strong and dry down corn.
Nielsen: Still a lot of grain to be made or lost in season. Question as to how we will finish off in Indiana.
Bob Nielsen, #Purdue Extension corn specialist: corn crop health has been good. Some dry pockets showing up in parts of the state.
Matli: Indiana is set for corn production record--1.04 billion bushels, 179 bushels/acre. Soybeans are at almost 280 mill bushels, 51 bu/ac.
Matli: National soybean production is 3.83 billion bushels, a record.
Matli: National corn production projected at 14 billion bushels based on Aug 1 harvest numbers, up 1 % from 2013.
1st to speak is USDA state statistician Greg Matli. #CropReport14
Akridge: Slow start to Indiana crop season, but more than 70 % of corn and soybeans are in good to excellent condition.
And we're off! Expert panel on #usda #CropReport14 mediated by Jay Akridge, dean of #Purdue's College of Ag.
Stay tuned for expert panel analysis of #CropReport14 at the #IndianaStateFair at 1:30 p.m.
