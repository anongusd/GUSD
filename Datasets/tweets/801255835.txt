5/4 Just consider how class traitors or counter-revolutionaries were ostracized and repressed in the Soviet Union.
4/4 and uncomfortable truths will be obscured with misinformation and hearsay. Finally, fascists attempt to draw a dividing line between the nation or group their organization purportedly represents and those seen as “outsiders.”
3/4 Once in power, fascists will consolidate their position by controlling information. Propaganda will be spread far and wide and fascist leaders will hog the airwaves. Any opposition media will be shut down or heavily censored,
2/4 First, fascists exploit public anger, whether it arises from a lost war, a loss of jobs or a decline in national prestige. Fascist leaders take advantage of this civil outrage, using stirring rhetoric and their charismatic personality to gain popular support.
1/4 The telltale signs of fascism	According to former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, fascist organizations tend to have a few things in common. (Continued below 👇)
