Out knocking doors today with @pamforpa. One year ago next week we won a special election here in #PA17. We have a chance for another big win here in #SD37 on April 2nd. 		Want to thank all the volunteers working hard to make it happen &amp; elect Pam Iovino to the State Senate. https://t.co/VsT7tdh86r
And to the boys at Mt. Lebanon, Moon, Quaker Valley, Lincoln Park, North Catholic, OLSH, Vincentian &amp; Nazareth Prep. Excited to watch some great games this weekend. #PA17
Too many #PA17 high school basketball teams in the #WPIAL Championships this weekend to fit in one tweet. Congrats &amp; good luck to the girls at North Allegheny, Char Valley, Central Valley, North Catholic, Shady Side Academy, OLSH &amp; Rochester.
Thinking of my friend @RepDebDingell today as she lays her husband @JohnDingell to rest at Arlington National Cemetery. A WWII veteran, a fierce defender of organized labor, a legendary public servant who will never be forgotten.
The victims of Parkland &amp; all victims of gun violence deserve action. This Congress has an opportunity to finally take real, meaningful action to prevent gun violence — starting with #HR8, a bipartisan bill to require universal background checks. Let’s get it done.
The first time I introduced a motion on the Floor — to protect funding for the VA &amp; its patients &amp; workers — one Republican crossed party lines to vote for it: Rep. Walter Jones. A true gentleman who loved veterans, loved the Marine Corps &amp; loved public service. Rest in peace.
Congrats to Aliquippa's @OfficialTyLaw on his selection to the NFL #HOF. Good luck to Penn Hills alum &amp; back-to-back NFL Defensive Player of the Year @AaronDonald97 in the Super Bowl. 		From pretty much everyone in #PA17, please beat the Patriots (no offense to Ty Law). https://t.co/2iAaLTfFFz

Joined @AohAllegheny Division 32 this morning at the National Cemetery of the Alleghenies to pick up wreaths from @WreathsAcross. Thanks to everyone at @VANatCemeteries for the great work you do maintaining this sacred place. https://t.co/1OrBntBJj3
This shutdown was entirely avoidable. This is the same bipartisan solution we reached more than a month ago. 800K+ American workers have been suffering for absolutely no reason. 		Thank you to those who were willing to cross party lines. Let's keep that going in the weeks ahead.
6 GOP senators voted w/ Dems to reopen the govt &amp; pay our people. We already have a bipartisan solution to this crisis. Senate ldrsp must join others unafraid to cross party lines for the good of the country.  Sinful that anyone will miss a paycheck tomorrow for work they've done
Senate Republicans will finally vote on whether to reopen the government.		RT to tell them to become part of the bipartisan solution, join several House Republicans &amp; all Democrats &amp; end this injustice.		The public servants protecting us must be paid this Friday. #EndTheShutdown
A lot of great local events celebrating Dr. King's legacy, including Beaver #MLKDay Banquet, MLK Prayer Breakfast at Ebenezer Baptist Church, @NorthHillsARC MLK Breakfast, &amp; Midland MLK Celebration.

Thanks to everyone who came out to be a part of the Pittsburgh #WomensMarch2019 today. Great to see such a strong organized labor presence at the march. Workers' rights are women's rights. https://t.co/Gxli5xxuML
Right now we have people here at PIT airport who are working, doing their jobs without getting paid. And we have people in Washington who are getting paid without working. That’s sinful. The Senate needs to #CallTheVote so we can reopen the government &amp; pay our workers. @3Afge https://t.co/KKlACqz4be
The real priority in our economy right now is making sure people have enough money to spend on Main Street, not Wall Street. 		That's why we need to #RaiseTheWage.
This week I cosponsored @BobbyScott's #RaiseTheWage Act to raise the minimum wage to $15/hour by 2024. Anyone working full-time in America should be able to support themselves &amp; their families, not forced to live in poverty.
Congrats to Char Valley girls on another great win, but these Moon freshmen said they'll be ready for a rematch in a couple years. Great to see Moon Twp Supervisor Michele Santicola tonight too. #PA17 https://t.co/6i4rJw2Av5

There's no reason the government should be shut down. Senate already passed a bipartisan bill to keep the govt open, &amp; it would immediately pass the House with overwhelming bipartisan support. Speaker Ryan can end this today. Let us vote and send the bill to the President’s desk.
1 year ago today was our 1st canvass in the special election. Just want to say thank you again to everyone who pushed us to get out there early, kept knocking doors for 11 straight months, &amp; donated to keep us going.		We won together. And we have a lot of good work ahead of us. https://t.co/2uQRhiswEF

President George H.W. Bush spent his life serving our country with dignity &amp; humility — in the Navy, as a public servant &amp; politician, as a husband, father &amp; grandfather. My thoughts are with his family as they celebrate his life &amp; mourn his death. Rest in peace, sir.
Wishing a #HappyHanukkah to all are who are celebrating in Western PA &amp; around the world. Chag Urim Sameach.

I've been in Congress for 6 months. And I know that if we put the old partisan politics aside, we can get a lot done. 		From protecting Medicare and health care, to creating jobs — we can make our government a force for good in the lives of our people. #PA17 #GOTV https://t.co/coh7yRdG7z

When it comes to Medicare &amp; Social Security, the choice in this election couldn't be clearer. We need Congress to stop constantly trying to cut these programs, start strengthening them, &amp; protect the benefits you pay for &amp; earn your entire working life. https://t.co/WR4yHZMoR7
Mitch McConnell says what Paul Ryan told us months ago: they're coming after Medicare &amp; Social Security to pay for their tax cuts. 		We've always known that was their agenda. We can do something about it on November 6th. #PA17 https://t.co/6wMaNTlrLw
Conor on #minimumwage: $7.25 is a poverty wage. It absolutely has to go up. It should get to $15 an hour. It can't get there overnight, especially not everywhere. But it has to get there &amp; it should be indexed to inflation so we don’t get behind like this again. #PA17
Conor: One thing is for sure: we are long past the point where we can have people in positions of leadership who deny that #climatechange is real. #PA17
Conor: I have never voted &amp; will never vote to cut #Medicare. My opponent can't say the same. #PA17
