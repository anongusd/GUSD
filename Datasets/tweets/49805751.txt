There's nothing brave or inspiring about running for cover when the roof is caving in during an inferno you brought matches to. Nothing redemptive about saying enough when you're nose-deep in the toxicity you contributed to. These men do not deserve any redemptive narrative.
So here's something I don't get: why are we admiring men who are just now abandoning the radioactive center of a toxic government after they willingly signed up to make it so?

@Merlistens Thank YOU for coming! https://t.co/L7Rz5TC8UN
Sitting at lunch with two #Podlandians I really admire I had not met IRL, sheepishly blurted out, "It's so weird to meet your heroes." Then went back to my salad since that was supposed to be an internal thought. But I was genuinely moved by this moment at #SoundEdu18. #Podlandia
There's simply nothing like being around people who love what they do and walk around in admiration of each other's work. That is something that I treasure and seek out in #Podlandia that has largely faded from some other fields as they have grown and expanded.
Still high off the tremendous energy I received from from fellow #Podlandians at #SoundEdu18 keynote on why intentionality is so necessary for creators in #Podlandia.

It's given me a path forward through the stench of decay from an infirmed, dying breed, lashing out at the prospect of its extinction. I will be here to witness its last breath. If not me, then my children. If not, my grandchildren. But some part of me will live to see that day.
I have chosen to also love myself in quotidian ways by drinking more water, taking more naps, watching some light TV, and most meaningfully, taking immersive flights of fancy into the company and future I am building. My refuse in my close relationships and my work has saved me.
Loving my children as they start a new school year. Loving my husband as he pushes himself and his company. Loving my youngest sister as she becomes a new mom. Loving my friends as they upgrade their jobs, houses, and spirits. Loving the brilliant creators who work on our shows.
My response to the emotional onslaught of the last few weeks has been to close in on my spheres of influence--namely my family, friends and the creators I work with. I have chosen to react to the misogyny, the hate, and the derision by encouraging , supporting and loving.

There they are. The team that has sustained our vision for @70MillionPod and grown it beyond my imagination. I will never be able to thank them enough. So give them a high-five if you see them. #DreamTeam #SquadGoals @DigitalSuperstars #PodcastingGold #PodcastStars
Completing the team is @ointhefield, our maverick associate producer and sound detective. Name a sound you want for that segment, blink, and she's found it. She's also a gifted editor who looks where others might glance, and finds gems.
And it's all sooooo pretty. The genius behind the @70MillionPod branding and identity is #KeniaDelRosario (who's not on here because, you know, she's too busy being brilliant). She leads all @LanWilCo graphic design and we just do whatever it takes to make her happy.
@70MillionPod is much more than words and sounds. We also have a website bursting with toolkits, resource guides, and a ton more cool stuff. And our resident wordsmith @AmyAlex63 sifted, organized, and translated it all for the good of the culture.
If you heard about us, you can thank @KateKrossch, who is our tireless champion and the architect of our marketing and media outreach. She tells us what to do and we just say, Yes Ma'am. And we love her for it.
Where would we be without the melodious, firm, and informative voice of our beauttiful host @mitzimoments? She flows like a river, carrying along the necessary knowledge to make @70MillionPod nourishing. And she is hella funny behind a mic.
Next is @luismgil, our master sound mixer, who is a sound whisperer and so patient with us as we send changes and more changes. His cinematic touch makes every episode a sound movie until the credits.
Now that you all got to hear the first episode of @70MillionPod it's time for a few shout-outs to the supernaturally talented crew that made it all happen. 		First up, @j_chien, our beloved Editrix who has kept us focused, has made our words shine, and our brains churn.
Read about me, my work, and vision for @ONA as you consider the candidates. #ONAelects #ONAVoteJuleyka		https://t.co/ON1VpPEo8h
.@ONA has spurred in me such growth, inspiration thanks to the visionary work, sisterhood from organizers, participants in the Women's Leadership Accelerator.
