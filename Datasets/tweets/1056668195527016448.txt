I wholly support and agree with this @GovMurphy legislation.  Likewise, no one should ever have to choose between earning a paycheck or publicly exposing rampant waste, fraud, and abuse @NJTRANSIT, the nation's most dangerous rogue railroad.  Huge loss for this #Whistleblower https://t.co/tDHG84BGr7
@HBLRNYC @fujow111 @NJTrainDelays @StratoMasterGuy @NJDHS is even more chaotic, bureaucratic, imcompetent, and riddled with waste, fraud, and abuse than @NJTRANSIT - as if that were possible.  Same situation, many hardworkers at the bottom using decades old systems and thwarted by overpaid cronies at the the top.  Sound familiar?
What if property taxes never came close to that $10K deduction limit in the first place? As the only fully developed and most densely populated states in the USA it’s absurd that property taxes are so high.  Waste, abuse, &amp; Incompetence, just like @NJTRANSIT https://t.co/6TI0wsr9Sj
@GovMurphy, have you decided which 4 or 5 star restaurant that you’ll use to dine while weathering the storm? https://t.co/vVrbiQHKJU
@SenatorLorettaW That is very sad Senator.  And although the boy I’m raising alone is alive and well, our saddest day is coming on Feb 5.  He won’t have a cake, a card, or any gifts as he turns 10.  Mind you, this is after Christmas already missed us twice! I’m glad I helped your committee!
@fujow111 @RyanBechtle @njdotcom @NJTRANSIT We tried hard.  Lawmakers omitted that verbiage from the final draft.  Now, workers, commuters, and the general public at large cannot sue @NJTRANSIT for violation of law unless @NJTRANSIT consents to it.  Hell, they don’t even need to finish PTC.  This is a stronger, fairer NJ??
@NJTrainDelays @GovMurphy Nothing other than his micro focus on a select few while the rest of us continue to suffer along.  Take a look at his tweets and where his priorities (wrongly) lie.
Under @GovMurphy, @NewJerseyOAG convinced the 3rd Circuit that NJT has sovereign immunity.  The nation’s most dangerous, rogue railroad is exempt from all federal laws.  Goodbye to FRSA, civil rights, ADA, FLSA, &amp; others.  @NJTRANSIT has a license to discriminate, injure, &amp; kill https://t.co/uZ7aI5QjiB
@SenatorLorettaW, 1 year since we were on @NBCNewYork together and the @NJTRANSIT audit, as you “guessed,” did substantiate my testimony, so why is my family still broke and hungry?		Former NJT Official Said He Was Fired for Doing His Job https://t.co/jAT2nhmzGY via @nbcnewyork
https://t.co/0LSKTPlmYc		18 months later and that ‘nationwide search’ resulted in the replacement of a handful of local cronies with others.   No changes and still many bad @GovChristie apples hiding in the depths.  I was the only NJT Executive required to compete nationwide.

If you’re here illegally or feel suppressed by your gender identity then @GovMurphy is your man.  I support these groups too, but we were promised a stronger &amp; fairer NJ for all.  382 days later and about 9 million of us are still waiting! #reinstatebarretta #nj #FixItPhilMurphy
I try to launch plans to clean up Newark Penn Station with full collaboration and support of another NJT Executive.  “Not your business, stay in your lane,” I was told. https://t.co/XYPufzh3VP
Thieves is about right . . . I’m sorry for your loss!  They’re into me for about a half of million right now.  Stick together amd we shall defeat America’s most dangerous rogue railroad. https://t.co/l9TIlRkqW4
@HBLRNYC @NJTrainDelays @mkouassi166 @FuckNjTransit @GirlReporterNJT @GovMurphy @LtGovOliver @RepMalinowski @brian4NY Thank You friends, it’s been a rough ride and I don’t even use @NJTRANSIT anymore.  Together, we can make a change.
Agreed.  I’ve now had a year and a half of paychecks withheld.  Practice what you preach Mr. @GovMurphy https://t.co/ASStoM4nuF
Theres no amount of money that a NJ jury of my peers will award that can replace the satisfaction of returning to service to the commuters of our great state!  I was on the right track until  @GovChristie derailed it and @GovMurphy prioritized the placement of his own hacks. https://t.co/aCbKlGfOo5
We were bamboozled.  Fortunately, NJ has one of the most well educated populations in the USA.  How does that go, trick us once shame on you, trick us twice, shame on us?  I don’t think we’ll be shamed again in 2022.  @GovMurphy, you forgot or don’t know how to #FixItPhilMurphy https://t.co/KwGDjWVwkc
This is what happens when a bureaucracy runs an oligopoly.  #sackthehacks @GovMurphy #philmadeitworse https://t.co/tpnEIZOa2b
My bank account doesn’t reflect that @GovMurphy, and I imagine the same holds true for most hardworking families.  Under you, @NewJerseyOAG seeks to strip @NJTRANSIT employees and commuters from basic federal rights and protections?  Even @GovChristie didn’t go that far. https://t.co/aGZu0YCd49
I have every phone number and extension for every person and department @NJTRANSIT.  Maybe I’ll just start  posting them here until @GovMurphy does the right thing.  #reinstatebarretta #reinstatetodd #FixItPhilMurphy https://t.co/xlQcoQeo2f
Thank you friends! https://t.co/De57JJPcLU
@GovMurphy, as I stated in a memo to my former boss and the @NJTRANSIT ED, you must purge the defective mindset that plagues the agency. They truly believe everything is peachy.  Executive meetings focus on congratulating each other and almost nothing else.
Point of Order Mr. @GovMurphy, Patsy Mink is considered the mother of Title IX legislation. Ms. Sandler was a zealous advocate. Sad nonetheless but why are you so uninformed?  Have you ever even heard of either woman prior to the aide that drafted this tweet? https://t.co/QUB83EB3Qp
Can you define ‘misguided rhetoric’ without using it in a sentence?  Are you planning to pass Gateway off as your own idea too? https://t.co/0VXk0LzcQ8
@ff_irish @NJTRANSIT @GovChristie @GovMurphy Sticks and stones brother.  Everyone knows who you and your brother are and I have plenty of stories about both of you.  I don’t mind one hater.  I have millions of grateful fans.
@saamk1324 @NJTRANSIT @GovChristie @GovMurphy Thank you.  My disappointment is trumped only by the feeling of exploitation.  We all remember what @GovMurphy said about me before he was elected.  How quickly he forgot.  https://t.co/Kv4VatcrkO
Really @NJTRANSIT?  @GovChristie fired me for engaging, informing, and improving.  Thanks, @GovMurphy for commissioning the commemorative billboard. I’m willing to guess that your penchant for passing my ideas off as your own is probably not gonna sit too well with our jury. https://t.co/c2i3SaX69g

Except that @NJTRANSIT didn’t meet the federal deadline. It met the requirement to obtain an additional 2 year extension to meet the deadline.  And that’s not a surprise nor news.  Celebrating an extension of a time as a ‘major milestone’ defines ignorance and arrogance. https://t.co/oH50kHu0aF
@CommutingLarry No, @GovMurphy Murphy. No major milestones here. I announced on @ChasingNews over a year ago that all @NJTRANSIT will do is complete the bare minimum of installation on the short line in order to qualify for the extension.  Nothing is finished. Just bought more time, literally.
My many thanks for your continued support.  Together, hopefully we can make the changes happen. https://t.co/yIJkIBofyT

@SenatorLorettaW, correctly told @NBCNewYork last January that she suspected that my claims about @NJTRANSIT would be “largely substantiated” by the results of the audit.  Well, we were both right and I could really use your help now, please, Senator. https://t.co/PmnfaDoOpd

@FirstLadyNJ Happy Thanksgiving to our first family.  My family will be most thankful if you can convince your husband to drop this nonsense against me and let me help him rebuild @NJTRANSIT, like I was hired to do last year.  We’re on the same side here.
Well, duh. https://t.co/S74qCI3Tl8
I lost just about everything this year except the unrelenting love and support from family and friends and; for that, I am most thankful today. Happy Thanksgiving!
@ff_irish @briandonohue @NJTRANSIT @News12NJ @GovMurphy @GovChristie The answer, Ken, is 6 years more than each Drewniak and my politico replacement who didn’t need to apply nor interview.  I, on the other hand, was the top candidate after a 3 month search, 137 applications, and many rounds of interviews.  Sorry bud, no flames to put out here.
@ff_irish @briandonohue @NJTRANSIT @News12NJ @GovMurphy @GovChristie Yes I am . . . Guilty of putting public safety above the welfare of my own family.  Guilty of refusing to be agreeable when commuters were at risk.  Guilty of believing that I could make a difference.  Guilty of doing my job.  It’s ok, I’m clearly serving my time for that crime.

I had a great conversation with @briandonohue about @NJTRANSIT for Brian’s Positively NJ on @News12NJ.  I’m not the only one wondering why @GovMurphy continues the @GovChristie campaign of retaliation against me.  #Whistleblower 		https://t.co/pzDpkZttW3
Last August, in response to further questions from @NancyFMunoz and @lizmuoioNJ, I testified to the Joint Leg. Committee that I would not put my son on @NJTRANSIT.

Equipment, Inventory, and Staffing Shortages.  I (and others) warned about it. Repeatedly. #NJTransit  #RunawayTrain #Disrepair #RealityCheck  #NJpolitics https://t.co/8zCQ6bjUzN
@jerzling @CommutingLarry @momofrazorsam @njdotcom Millions would be spent on the system and it would never get implemented. They have lots of new toys and technology that collect dust. Ask about the 300K ECM document system or status of Oracle while they still use DOS for critical records. No one takes ownership. #NJTransit
@fujow111 @NYCinvestigates @ABC7NY @NJTRANSIT @GovChristie Paul Oliva’s trial is about to get underway this month.  That’ll be another good one to follow.
@fujow111 @NYCinvestigates @ABC7NY @NJTRANSIT Santoro also said that they “have every expectation to meet the PTC deadline.” @NJTRANSIT called my testimony “uninformed, grossly and wholly untrue.”  @GovChristie said it “false and retaliatory.”  Nobody’s surprised that he would come to eat those words. #vindication #SLAPPSuit
@ff_irish @northjersey My personnel record does not have a negative item.  I was first disciplined following contact with the legislative committee.  My non-political job was immediately filled by an @GovChristie Appointee without even an interview.  NJT changed the basis for termination 4 times.

@yarmuclops Sure.  Please email me to set it up.  tcbarretta@gmail.com
@ff_irish @NJTrainDelays @GovChristie @GovMurphy @LtGovOliver That was made up AFTER the testimony.  I don’t have a single correspondance about the car.  My termination letter says I didn’t return a laptop.  They made up the car when I showed the receipt for the returned laptop.
@ff_irish @NJTrainDelays @GovChristie @GovMurphy @LtGovOliver Here’s a bit more of the story.  As for the rest, please just compare the transcript from my legistlative testimony against the final audit report.  Is it false and retaliatory too?		https://t.co/M0DeRq2siO

When @GovMurphy snubbed me over the Lottery ED job earlier this year, I had blamed my NJT saga.

To the 1200+ commuters who were trapped on the dark @NJTRANSIT train 2 days ago, please enjoy the repainted lines and know that NJT is “always working to improve the customer experience.”  This is exactly what I’ve been saying is wrong. No vision. No priorities. #NJTransit https://t.co/rG6bj3i06d
