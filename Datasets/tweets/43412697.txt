Yes, you cannot have a subscription to every paper. But you can likely afford at least one. 	If you pay many multiples for cable what you pay for journalism, consider rebalancing your information portfolio. 	And yeah, the Mercers hope you don‚Äôt.
Pay for quality journalism you care about. 	Journalists don‚Äôt work for free. 	Reporting is expensive and sometimes very dangerous.	Why do people stick up for the work and dignity of almost any profession but ours? 	We literally do it for you. https://t.co/4eeaM168X4

There could still be celibate orders, but that would be a devotional choice not a requirement. And while celibacy doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúcause‚Äù pedophilia, the culture of secrecy around *any* sexual relations is part of the reason why priest predators are not called out and stopped.
Women will feel increasing alienated from a church that doesn‚Äôt treat them as fully equal. Seen from that vantage point, the Catholic Church seems to be embracing ultimate extinction.
Priests have been having sex since always. Women were instrumental leaders in early Church. Anyway, it doesn‚Äôt take a genius to see the way out.
Admitting women into the priesthood and allowing priests to marry would be the obvious way to begin to fix the Catholic Church‚Äôs sexual abuse (and declining laity in US/Europe) problem.

4/ thanks to the docs, nurses, techs, PTs, exterminators, boat and donation collectors, garage door fixers, and everybody else who helped out. And my coworkers, who covered and managed everything so well.
3/ Now Milo and I are back here. Didn‚Äôt know if this was a trip to say goodbye, tbh. But my dad‚Äôs numbers are back up, his color is good, he‚Äôs eating, already trying to lift too much. Don‚Äôt know how long this remission will last but every day is a gift.
2/ every day was a barrage of infusions and transfusions and complications that were frightening and utterly impossible for my dad and stepmom to cope with. My brother and stepsisters rallied and‚Äîsometime against intense resistance‚Äîgot them in a better place.
1/ Seven weeks ago I was at my Dad‚Äôs house, in full on crisis mode after his AML diagnosis. He was incredibly frail, no immune system, unable to do almost anything. We cleaned out garage, papers organized, got his meds and treatment sorted, nursing care in place.

@ryangrim @tomwatson I don‚Äôt troll his supporters. I don‚Äôt jump into their mentions and take screen shots of tweets out of context and engage in group chats to mob perceived enemies. Pointing out that he has a major problem created by some of his supporters is not trolling. It is analysis.
The Democrats cannot put forward two white men, or two white people imo, and hope to win. So the possible pairings get very interesting very fast.

@Randy1116 The problem is that advertising revenue is going away and needs to be replaced with subscription or other revenue.
@originalspin @mims @JesseThorn yeah that is interesting model that i think works for MaxFun. But like if a reader wanted to support MoJo, the NYT, Wired, and the MercNews...idk if that could work. 		Or even all Conde Nast/Advance pubs, say.

@mims except for all the stories that pubs duck b/c too close to billionaire's heart and wallet.
@edmundlee @MotherJones 11/ Also, I feel like journalists are sometimes the worst at supporting media they care about. **Not the young/broke ones, but the ones who can afford it.** If you can, but you're not, supporting a bunch of news orgs, you're part of the problem.
@ExcessiveFarce @edmundlee @MotherJones Yeah, they have. Not sure any of those attempts were optimally executed.
@mims i dunno. I think more workable would be something like, for TK a month, you get 1 paper, 3 magazines, and TK. 	 	Maybe some would opt for a "worldview" package. 		Anyway still the problem of how to divvy the $$
Agreed but that's been tried too. Still, maybe an a la carte  bundle... https://t.co/hbTsyg1eOm
Vox has been clever about using sites that still get local ads, liked curbed and eater and racked and SB Nation, after all, to (I'd imagine) help fund the overall product(s)
eh, not sure this is the issue. Advertisers weren't willing to pay as much. and again b/c the platforms and CraigsList sucked all the money up, and papers and news media IN GENERAL didn't make the case that you must pay for quality. https://t.co/5dK8gyev60
@lizzieohreally and from the people who give long lectures re correlation vs causality in all things reportorial!!!
@lizzieohreally I mean, otoh, whatever makes you happy. but...
@chimpvsdog @edmundlee People have tried. It's too much of a pain in the ass for readers who just bounce to something else.
@lizzieohreally I've got an office full of people railing against climate denialists and anti-vaxxers who somehow are into tarot and astrology. what is happening.
@WildeV @edmundlee @popbitch Micropayments have been a dream for so long here. Glad it's working for you. Maybe, eventually, it could at scale, but then it would be the big pubs banding together, there would be losers.
@johnwbradley you might want to look at any design blog or mag. It's back, baby.
@edmundlee @MotherJones 10/ So if you value us, consider a donation. $5 a month ALSO gets you the print mag: https://t.co/8f2WC7Sx12
@edmundlee 9/ Anyway, here's @MotherJones revenue breakdown. The majority comes from readers. And though advertising is a small portion, we're getting pummeled there like everybody else. https://t.co/yxxfMvNMGl
@edmundlee 8/ "Can't you find a way for me to pay you without sending me all these dead trees?" My last real argument with David. Who'd be bringing some fire to the platforms and other bad or dumb actors were he still with us.
@edmundlee 7/ A metered paywall‚Äîwhich (only?) works for something at the Times' scale‚Äîthat drives you to a digital sub is a way to persuade your core readers to pony up for all it does, even if you don't read it all.
@edmundlee 6/ "Buy a subscription for a classroom" is basically a way to throw the NYT more money because you want it to be around.
@edmundlee 5/ Re NYT. I remember getting into a heated debate with David Carr, my old boss, about whether, as I proposed, the NYT should figure out a way for people to donate to it with or without a sub. He thought that would sour advertisers and investors. But they basically do that now.
@edmundlee 4/ Anyway, yes, the future is reader supported. Via subscriptions, donations, paywalls, newsletters, events, etc. 		Support the media you care about. The billionaires and esp the VCs aren't always content to subsidize for the long haul.
@edmundlee 3/ The Washington Post, The Atlantic, (and also the LAT), have been bought by billionaires who've injected a ton of cash into them. The NYT also has benevolent rich owners. 		Axios also got investment from the Atlantic's owner and like Vox, VCs. 		Hopefully it lasts.
@edmundlee 2/ Would just like to point out a few things about the success stories in this paragraph: https://t.co/2ro9jlKzd7
