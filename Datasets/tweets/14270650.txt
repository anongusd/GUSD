In 1974, Ronald Reagan addressed the first CPAC. He began his speech by hailing the heroism of three special guests he had brought. One of them was John McCain. @cindymccain @MeghanMcCain @ReaganWorld https://t.co/Fu6TWdgpAc
Interesting thread. Amazing how many commenters do not recall the spirited debates in the 1970s and 80s between the moderate and conservative factions of the GOP. Reagan won on the power of ideas, not invective. https://t.co/7SWznG41iJ
@eeErtc @ReaganWorld @CPAC @mschlapp @realDonaldTrump Not true. In the 1980s, there were spirited debates within the Republican Party, over both social issues and fiscal ones.
@editor_wp @ReaganWorld @CPAC @mschlapp Actually, there were a lot of moderate Republicans in those days, many more than now.

@HmmNotSoFastBud @BresPolitico This is not my opinion. This is my experience.
@HmmNotSoFastBud @BresPolitico As for what constitutes "aggressive" on Capitol Hill -- scenes like this happen far more often than you might imagine: https://t.co/ktk6ZGNZgt
@HmmNotSoFastBud @BresPolitico And Capitol Hill -- which as I mentioned, I have covered since 1983 --  is a far more open environment than the White House. Members are constantly approached and questioned by reporters in the hallways. It is part of the way the institution operates.
@HmmNotSoFastBud @BresPolitico With all due respect, you have no idea what you are talking about. King has been questioned repeatedly by reporters about what he said. In fact, his latest comments were comments he MADE to a New York Times reporter. 1/2
@dave_in_sa @lobitaboricua @brianstelter @IlhanMN I once had a member claim that something he said to me was off the record because he had said it on an elevator. You know what I did? I wrote what he said.
@dave_in_sa @lobitaboricua @brianstelter @IlhanMN There is a much more open atmosphere on Capitol Hill (a branch of government I have covered since 1983) than the White House. Members should expect to be questioned by reporters in the hallway. And they deserve criticism when they stiff-arm reporters.
@HmmNotSoFastBud @BresPolitico Bull. I have covered Capitol Hill since 1983. This is not a sexist criticism. It is a valid one.
@dave_in_sa @lobitaboricua @brianstelter @IlhanMN The press reports. We get up and go to work every damn day. We get exhausted, but we keep digging and reporting and telling the truth. Then the voters decide whether they want a person in office -- whether they want to reward or punish conduct.
RT @BresPolitico: If you don’t want to face questions from reporters, don’t run for Congress https://t.co/gTlH0sxw51
@dave_in_sa @lobitaboricua @brianstelter @IlhanMN But they are not, as you earlier claimed, "treated as stand-alone comments." The fact that constant pressure has not forced him to change his ways does not mean the media is not doing its job. It speaks to the fact that his base doesn't care, and his base is all he cares about.
@moz_chica @kat261952 @brianstelter @benshapiro @IlhanMN The fact that Trump is now tweeting about how the fact checkers are "fake news" shows he is fully aware of the criticism.
@moz_chica @kat261952 @brianstelter @benshapiro @IlhanMN Yes, they do. But generally -- and this is true with every president I've covered -- on those rare moments when you get face time with a president, there is usually pressing news that is a higher priority than verbal sparring. 1/2

@lobitaboricua @dave_in_sa @brianstelter @IlhanMN Actually, the White House is constantly being asked about the meaning of his tweets.  They are greatly discussed and analyzed by journalists after he sends them, and factchecked extensively. They are never just accepted at face value.

As the golf course took shape, more hands were needed. Bosses told Zuñiga and his friends to bring workers. The town of Santa Teresa answered the call.
Amid Trump’s push for a border wall, there has been little public discussion of how U.S. employers — including the president himself — have generated demand for unlawful workers.
The brightly painted homes that line the road in Santa Teresa de Cajon, many paid for by wages earned 4,000 miles away, are the fruits of a long-running pipeline of illegal workers to the president’s course.
WaPo spoke w/ 16 men and women from Costa Rica &amp; other Lat Am countries, including six in Santa Teresa de Cajon, who said they were employed at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster. All of them said they worked for Trump without legal status — and that their managers knew.

Not outside the realm of possibility, of course, that they will try to go big on immigration issues, including DACA. But that is not the normal MO for appropriators, &amp; raises questions of jurisdiction with other panels. My hunch is tight focus on border security.
Something to keep in mind: The members of the new conference committee charged with coming up with a deal in three weeks are all appropriators. Not judiciary or other panels. Suggests this will deal with not range into, for instance, DACA or broader immigration issues.

@MargaretFenwic8 https://t.co/9r80cQJHhd
@MargaretFenwic8 As I mentioned in another tweet, it is very normal for presidents to refer to speakers by their first names. And not vice versa. He called Ryan Paul and still calls McConnell Mitch. O’Neill was universally known as Tip. Gingrich as Newt. And Rayburn as Sam or “Mr. Sam.”
@ashschoen Compare to Crooked Hillary. Absence of adjective is telling.
@DonnaDzippy Okay, so you said that in way fewer characters than I did...
@BadCatWillie Nope. For once, he is actually using the proper term: https://t.co/sNu7ds1bh7
@ashschoen No, many, many presidents have referred to speakers by their first names. And Trump used Ryan’s first name. As well as McConnell’s. Tip was always Tip. Rayburn was Sam — or “Mr. Sam.” And Newt was Newt. More the norm than the aberration.
@Austidog Not saying that. Saying the opposite. Today, he seems to have a more keen understanding that there is another branch of government, co-equal to his own. May not last. But potentially significant
Understand skepticism that Trump wrote this, but his treatment of Pelosi very different from how we have seen him deal with others. So far, no nicknames, no belittling (after she warned him off characterizing her strength in the Oval). So far. With Trump, things can always change

No snark here. This is the most hopeful thing I’ve seen that there may be a way out of this shutdown. Trump’s MO — which worked for him when his own party ran things — is to mow down anyone who stands in his way. Perhaps this is recognition that things have changed. Perhaps.

Perhaps I’m naive. (Judging from tweeps mad at me.) But I don’t want to give up on teenagers. I mean, they should offer real service, not just things that look good on their college resumes. And I think they can learn. The American Experience has been a learning curve.

@_R_S_S_ @mikiebarb but it turned out that what he said was pretty nuanced, and i could see why other sources with access to that information were giving it a different spin.
@_R_S_S_ @mikiebarb So many. Most hair-raising I can recall was when I was under huge pressure to confirm something circulating about what Clinton told the Starr grand jury. It made sense, and would have been a big headline. But I trusted my source saying we shouldn't. he was right.

@MahGill @AriFleischer I suspect that Cohen’s testimony — if it happens — will be somewhat limited by what Mueller allows him to say in public.
@ImDavidDunn A single source, if I know that not many others have and could confirm the information. But if it is someone with whom you don’t have that kind of relationship, most reporters would be far more circumspect.
@ImDavidDunn It is highly situational. Many of my anonymous sources are people I have dealt with for years, even decades. I understand why they have to remain anonymous; they understand that I am doing my best to be fair and accurate. In some cases, I would even go with 1/2

@AriFleischer For me, the crucible was Clinton impeachment. There was lots of inaccurate reporting, but also things we decided were wrong that turned out to be right. ABC took lots of heat for the blue dress. Most of us decided it was a myth. It turned out to be true: https://t.co/drZ6OeqV6G
@AriFleischer “Too good to check” is actually a joke, not a principle reporters follow. The other aphorism: The most miserable reporter is one who has a scoop that remains a scoop.
@ImDavidDunn And flat-out wrong. OTOH, ABC took a lot of heat for reporting on a single source that there was a stained blue dress. Most media ended up deciding it was a myth. It turned out to be true: https://t.co/drZ6OeqV6G

@RubricMarlin Nope. I think they are great. That is why they had such strong bipartisan approval. but as pretty much everyone who lives along the border will tell you, a wall that extends the entire border is impractical and expensive and ineffective.

@armandodkos @daphna27 @edlane3 Look, I have 750 words per column. Every column is not going to cover the entire landscape. I went to Iowa. I wrote about what I saw.
@armandodkos @edlane3 Perhaps we should just disengage here. I have work to do.
@armandodkos @edlane3 For Hillary, it would also be unbelievable against what is likely to be the field in 2020.
@armandodkos @edlane3 At this point, Warren is nowhere near that. But you are not listening to what I am saying. So perhaps we should just discontinue this discussion. Yes, Warren must work on that. I don't think the Hillary model is what she should follow.
@armandodkos @edlane3 I'm not arguing that every Democrat doesn't need to appeal to them. I'm saying HRC is not the model for what the dynamic is likely to be in 2020.
@armandodkos @edlane3 Read my last tweet. There could be three or four African-American candidates running in 2020.
@armandodkos @edlane3 No, I'm not. I'm saying that 2020 is a new ballgame in that regard. When HRC was up against an African-American in a primary, she lost the black vote. There are likely to be several. Not saying EW doesn't need to appeal. Saying HRC not the model.
@armandodkos @edlane3 Also one reason she lost was a drop off in African-American turnout. So she’s not exactly the model.
@armandodkos @edlane3 The point of it was to address the pundits lumping every woman together. But while we are at it, there are likely to be four or more POC in the 2020 field. Probably Even HRC wouldn’t consolidate the minority vote 1/2
@armandodkos @edlane3 I was in Iowa, which is not the best place to gauge her appeal with POC. But they are very much a part of her message.

@_R_S_S_ @PostOpinions Would have been an unnecessary cul de sac away from the point I was trying to make.
@spenser222 @PostOpinions And (3) impeaching a president can backfire on the opposition party that does it too hastily.
@spenser222 @PostOpinions Which assumes (1) that impeachment is not necessarily linked to job approval and (2) a president who has really high job approval — which does not describe Trump — can survive it. Neither of those things seem to have sunk in for Trump.
@TCat1984 @PostOpinions It seems that way only to people who do not like Clinton. To Clinton and those around him, impeachment is a stain on his presidency — making him one of only 2 in history — and something he will never shake.
@_R_S_S_ @PostOpinions WW was so dense that had they just released the damn documents, there was a good chance it would have produced 3 days of rough coverage and gone away. (See Stephanopoulos) Instead, they were forced into a position of having to renew the IC law, and it was off to the races.
@_R_S_S_ @PostOpinions Then don’t fall back on that lecture-me routine for a perfectly valid post. Also, see the link I posted earlier.

@_R_S_S_ @PostOpinions Well, if this is your way of schooling me on this, that’s fine. In this case, it was not relevant to what I wrote about. What I wrote about was job approval and impeachment. Feel free to unfollow. WW figured more in opinion about allowing IC law to expire.
@_R_S_S_ @PostOpinions I covered that whole saga. Don’t recall that as a factor, either in my reporting or the polling. Most folks never figured out what whitewater was about and had pretty much forgotten that was the root of the investigation.

@DavisPBO @KathyGavin7 @ghoshworld I can't disagree with you there.
@nhprman @DavisPBO @KathyGavin7 @ghoshworld Sorry. Here's a link to my column: https://t.co/RNjPCJJqvL
@Michael2014abc Your exact words were "predicated on sealing the border." Which is not true. And there was no fence or wall, which was the point of my original tweet, which you said showed that I am "stupid." Just quoting your own words here. Like I did with Reagan.
Interestingly, it was Bill Clinton, not Reagan, who put the first significant resources into border fencing. Immigration debates in those days were way more interesting, because they didn't break down on party and ideological lines. Less tribal. https://t.co/sBh9es4pO3
@Michael2014abc I can't spend any more time on this, but would recommend you go back and research the immigration debates of those days. They were much more interesting, because they didn't break down neatly on party and ideological lines. Way less tribal, less kneejerk.
@Michael2014abc Yup. Clinton. "Operation Safeguard and Hold the Line." But it started earlier than I recalled:  https://t.co/sBh9es4pO3
@Michael2014abc If I recall correctly, and I would have to go back and check myself on this, it was Clinton, not Reagan, who put significantly more resources into fencing, etc., on the border, in the late 90s. Which is also ironic.
@Michael2014abc And there was absolutely no assumption that the border would be "sealed." No one then was that (to use your word)  stupid.
@Michael2014abc There was some additional money, but that was not the thrust of the bill. Employer sanctions were. My original tweet -- which you said showed me to be "stupid" -- was in response to Trump saying falsely that Reagan fought for a wall. He didn't. It's a lie.
@ktdid56 That was what the unions argued at the time (see the other story on that page with my byline). I think their thinking on this has shifted in the decades since.
@Michael2014abc However, I will not be so impolite as to call you "stupid." Uninformed seems to be the better way to put it.
@Michael2014abc Not a wall, not a fence, not "sealing" the borders. The big fight was over employer sanctions. Read my column. It has the history, and also relevant quotes from Reagan's farewell address.
https://t.co/fN5XpWZvaH
@Michael2014abc I covered that bill, with all its ups and downs and near-death experiences, for three years for the LA Times. I also covered the aftermath.

@eddiegizzard @Ed_Realist The political environment was pretty acrid, even before Trump's arrival in it. And the president did not invent the social media blast, though he has amplified its use in politics.
@Ed_Realist There was also plenty in the pre-written obit from long ago that was done by J.Y. Smith, an obituary editor who died in 2006.
@Ed_Realist Actually, you would be wrong. I turned in my first draft of this story more than five years ago, and yes, there was plenty about his class and grace. Because that was who he was.

@chrislongview And what you are complaining about is one tweet. My main beat is the campaign, but I have used my twitter feed constantly to call attention to fine reporting 1/2
@ImaPrivate True. But one does not exclude the other — or excuse the other.
