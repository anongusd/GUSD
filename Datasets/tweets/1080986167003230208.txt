#CA39 Update: This morning I was able to join in the celebration for @Bob4Senator, the CA Senator for the 32nd District. It was great to see @QurikSilva65th and Assemblymember Sunny Park. https://t.co/IiUGsYtifY
RT @RepLowenthal: The Administration has continued its shameful efforts to deport Vietnam War era refugees from South East Asia. We’re work…
More importantly, I hope we can move on &amp; work on the issues that our constituents elected us to tackle. Whether its protecting affordable healthcare, veteran services, common sense gun legislation, or immigration reform, I'm ready to move on &amp; get to work for the people of #CA39
It is important that we put partisanship aside &amp; do our jobs for the American people. I hope we can now move forward &amp; work together on real, sensible solutions to keep our borders secure and our communities safe.
Not to mention the long-term damage the President has done to our economy.	@HouseDemocrats voted 11 times on 10 separate bills to reopen the government &amp; each time we faced opposition from Senate Republicans.
This past month our federal employees and their families were put in a situation they did not deserve. I'm glad the President has agreed to re-open the government, but disappointed that it took him 35 days. All the while American families were unfairly used as bargaining chips.
#CA39 Update: Today I visited the OC Veterans Service Center and met with Chairman Bobby MacDonald and Eric Ensley. I look forward to working closely with the center to ensure our veterans are taken care of. https://t.co/vRJFCjUBb4
Today is day 35 of the President's shut down &amp; our public servants aren’t “sacrificing,” they are being held hostage. Many are missing their second paychecks today. It’s past time to end this. #EndtheShutdown https://t.co/ee4CxAlVym
ICYMI: Today I made my first floor speech on how my constituents are being hurt by the President's #Shutdown . Enough is enough. https://t.co/huB5q4buTC
At 12:30 PM PST I'll speak for the 1st time on the House floor to share stories of how the President's shutdown is hurting the people of #CA39. You can hear me share their stories at the link: https://t.co/MXfkYXSXU7
@RepDeanPhillips @dog_rates @HouseDemocrats Nice doggo @RepDeanPhillips. Our Press Pup Booster is also pretty busy helping us make puppy pitches. @HouseDemocrats https://t.co/Ni42AZiUKa
Today I was gaveled into my 1st committee meeting w/ @HASCDemocrats. Honored to be serving on the Seapower and Protection Force &amp; Military Personnel subcommittees. I promise to provide insight into how our military is run &amp; how to best serve our service members. https://t.co/YeH7ZDUHP7
I joined @HouseDemocrats to vote for the 11th time on bipartisan legislation to reopen the goverment and #EndTheShutdown. It's time the President and @senatemajldr stop holding the federal government hostage, the lives of our federal employees are not bargaining chips. https://t.co/IiBctK31jg
Instead of ending this #shutdown POTUS continues to demand his useless border wall. @HouseDemocrats are taking concrete actions to invest in smart effective border security, but the Senate Majority Leader refuses to do his job and take up the bipartisan legislation.
I am honored to be joining the @HouseNewDems under @RepDerekKilmer leadership. I am committed to bringing #CA39's voice to promote economic growth &amp; fiscally responsible legislation.
Air quality in the US has improved dramatically over the past several decades thanks to the #CleanAirAct, but our environmemt faces daily threats by the Trump admin. We must fight to ensure #HealthyAirForAll, especially underserved comunities of color. https://t.co/sOsQ8C0frt
The President said he was "proud to shut down the government." The pay of the men and women of federal law enforcement &amp; our homeland security community, incl the Coast Guard, FBI, DEA should not be used as a negotiating tactic. Period. #EndTheShutdown
.@PhfeWic is providing assistance to federal employees in the LA, OC, SBC area who are affected by the shutdown. For more information please visit: https://t.co/b1Y1AgzAEX
Today marks the 46th Anniversary of Roe v. Wade. Yet we still have politicians that believe they have the authority to regulate what happens between a woman &amp; her doctor. We must continue to stand up for women' s healthcare rights &amp; protect #RoeVWade. https://t.co/UhIb0DgBXQ
This #shutdown has gone on for 32 days. On day 1, Democrats voted to re-open the government with a bill that unanimously passed the Senate last year. It's on POTUS to act on bipartisan legislation and stop holding our federal employees hostage.
We must move to #renewDACA immediately. DREAMers are students, teachers, service members, and community members. We owe them permanent protections.	https://t.co/cEzIaAppXJ
The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the President's transgender troop ban is a discredit to their service and harms our national security. We need to stand against hate and protect the rights of our transgender service members. https://t.co/TLzz5kpe9d
It's with great pride &amp; excitement to announce that our 1st district office will be open in a few weeks in Fullerton. We are thankful for your patience during this transition period. My team &amp; I are busy ensuring we are equipped to deliver the best constituent services possible. https://t.co/lWcurDVEeI
#CA39 Update: Glad I was also able to meet with @cityofbrea Mayor Christine Marick &amp; City Manager Bill Gallardo. It's important to me that my team &amp; I establish relationships with all the cities to ensure that the district's voices are heard in DC. https://t.co/tSx0nFXXPz
It was also great meeting with Supervisor Doug Chaffee at the Pickled Monk where I met one of my constituents Jose, who became a citizen in October and casted his first vote for me in November. https://t.co/Ay7cnB9mxE
#CA39 Update: Thank you @FullertonCA City Manager Ken Domer and Mayor Jesus Silva for meeting with me today. I look forward to working together to tackle homelessness and public safety.
Citizens United was decided 9 years ago today. It's time to end corruption in our government &amp; why I've cosponsored #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act – our plan for transparency, voter empowerment, election protection &amp; campaign finance reform.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. carried a message of hope, equality &amp; justice. As his legacy lives on, let us not forget that the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice. #MLKDay https://t.co/xKUXpSu2XB
I want to thank @OCYD for having me on their diversity panel today. #CA39 is one the most diverse districts in the country. I truly believe our society is stronger when we promote diversity. We all have a responsibility to foster &amp; encourage the next great diverse leaders. https://t.co/XxqLBDxHUZ
The President is the one who shut down the government, tried to end DACA, and has put TPS in limbo. He should stop playing political games with people's lives and sign the bipartisan legislation Democrats passed on the first day of this new Congress to open the government.
#CA39 Update: It was great marching alongside everyone morning at @OCWomensMarch. We must continue the fight. https://t.co/0r9Z3rQVk2
Tomorrow I will march in solidarity at the @OCWomensMarch. I hope to see you all there to celebrate the record breaking election of women leaders across the county and continue the fight for women's rights and equality. https://t.co/iGxKj8O9HU
#CA39 Update: Today I met with @Chino_Hills City Council members, @councilchick &amp; Vice Mayor to discuss the needs of our consituents. I look forward to working closely with them to ensure we invest in transportation and community development. https://t.co/tRv8CGXivr
POTUS's #shutdown continues to use the American people’s lives as political collateral. It's why I’ve stood in solidarity with the thousands of federal employees &amp; Coast Guard members who are struggling to pay their bills by defering my paycheck. #EndTheShutdown
This administration continues to try and push its anti-immigrant agenda. But I have faith that SCOTUS will preserve DACA just as the lower courts have. We owe it to our DREAMers. #ProtectDACA	https://t.co/BvsCqOTULM
Time and time again, @HouseDemocrats have voted to reopen the government so dedicated federal employees can get back to work and get paid, yet the Senate and the president refuse to vote on our legislation. #EndTheShutdown
Separating children from their families at the border is cruel and unnecessary. It's shameful that the Trump admin put this policy in place &amp; then had the nerve to lie about its severity. Enough is enough. America is better than this. 	https://t.co/SdI33wkY4M
I'm ready to lend my expertise to the Committee and ensure we are doing more for our vets. Because it's time we serve those who served us. "
OC is home to the largest veterans population w/o its own VA Hospital or cemetery. This should not be the case. We need to improve and strengthen the GI Bill to help our vets who seek higher education.
"Thread: I am honored to join @VetAffairsDems under the leadership of @RepMarkTakano. During my campaign, I established a #CA39 Veterans Steering Committee so that I hear firsthand the struggles &amp; needs of our veterans.
I am proud to be a co-sponsor of @RepKirkpatrick American Dream Employment Act, a bill that would allow DREAMers to work on Capitol Hill. We are a nation of immigrants &amp; their input is we what need on the Hill. https://t.co/mVu6xIixK1
Great to join my friends &amp; SoCal Dem colleagues at Bullfeathers for a discussion w/ @ChrisJansing on our first few weeks. Be on the lookout tomorrow for the highlights! https://t.co/Lag30Gn18v
Proud to announce that I am joining the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition (SEEC). Congress needs to come together and do its part to protect our planet &amp; combat #climatechange. https://t.co/c38mhttQtN
CA39 Update: Tonight we recognized Steve Harris, an elected Trustee for the Centralia School District. I want to thank him for his decades of hard work and service to his community and wish him a happy retirement. https://t.co/XpqHhtbzqh
I'm proud to be joining @HouseDemocrats in introducing the #ForThePeople Act – our plan to end corruption in government. https://t.co/JTcoeOPTFt
Joined @RepBonamici and 70 of my colleagues calling on @BetsyDeVos to help student loan borrowers who are being affected by the #shutdown. These federal employees work tirelessly for our constituents &amp; we should not be hurting their ability to meet their loan obligations. https://t.co/hZe8vGhZJC
Yesterday, for the first time in US history, a branch of the military did not recieve their paychecks. Our service men and women answered the call to serve &amp; this is not how we should repay them. It’s time to #EndTheShutdown 	https://t.co/vlHDEwlQrJ
It's time to #EndTheShutdown. The President may want to play politics with his wasteful wall, but our Democratic House is ready to move our country forward #ForThePeople
The #2020census citizenship question is a transparent attempt to intimidate immigrant families &amp; has put funding for healthcare, schools &amp; communities at risk. Congress should also act to ensure the census is not politicized. https://t.co/k9lwBCBN8b
Instead of working towards reforming our immigration system, the President is playing politics with our government. As we enter week 4 of the shutdown over 42,000 immigration hearings have been canceled. 	https://t.co/Kf90m4Tc0A
Nearly 1/3 of the federal employees affected by the shutdown are veterans -- and many suffer from disabilities that are service related. The President needs to stop putting their health and livelihoods at risk and re-open the government. #EndTheShutdown
Excited to announce I've been selected to serve on @HASCDemocrats. As a vet, I know how our military works &amp; what service members require to keep our nation safe. Thousands of my constituents rely on the work of HASC &amp; I know I can bring oversight &amp; expertise to the committee.
As an exec board member of @CAPAC I'm proud to join the Korean American community in my district in celebrating #KoreanAmericanDay. As Olympians, business owners, doctors, &amp; servicemembers, Korean Americans have had a tremendous impact on our culture &amp; country. https://t.co/JllbfhFIIt
Our veterans served our country without asking for anything in return. We should take care of them by making sure they receive the medical care they deserve. There are issues in the VA medical system, but this proposal needs further analysis &amp; oversight. https://t.co/RwCSHutVPK
Unacceptable. Families still recovering from natural disasters, including those in CA affected by the deadly wildfires, deserve resources to be made whole. The President is jeopardizing their well-being for a talking point. https://t.co/NFC6USVKx8
The President continues to risk the livelihood of our public servants and military for a wasteful border wall. As a veteran, I know there are smart, effective ways we can improve border security, while also staying true to humane immigration reform. #EndTheShutdown
Proud to stand with @RepThompson for universal background checks &amp; cosponsor the bipartisan background checks bill. No family should ever lose their grandfather, like I did mine. #NeverAgain https://t.co/spZ97YYdjy https://t.co/MjQp73fHJq
Honored to be a part of the largest @HispanicCaucus class in history. I promise to fight for all families and all communities and ensure everyone is given equal opportunities and respect. https://t.co/l299CppWCp
I'm joining @RepColinAllred &amp; my Democratic colleagues in pledging to defend the ACA and protections for those with pre-existing conditions, including the more than 320,700 in #CA39. #ProtectOurCare

The President continues to lie in order to justify his senseless border wall. What the American people want is real, humane immigration reform, especially protections for DREAMers and TPS holders. https://t.co/Iyw2NjfNsZ
The President's shutdown is hurting our working and middle class families. This is inexcusable. SNAP is our nation's leading anti-hunger program &amp; provides critical resources. I joined my colleague @rosadelauro in calling on the @USDA to address the impacts of the shutdown.
We must pass #HR8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act immediately. It’s long past time Congress acts on common sense bipartisan gun legislation. It’s what more than 90% of the country wants. #NeverAgain https://t.co/ZXzvPuom84
Proud to cosponsor @RepThompson's background check bill. I've also cosponsored legislation to close the gun show loophole &amp; get guns of the hands of those on the no-fly list. I'll always stand w/ @GabbyGiffords &amp; call for common sense gun legislation. https://t.co/tjC6uerDxP
Great to see OCEA, @AGBecerra, @DoloresHuerta, @AsmBlancaRubio,@HonSusanRubio &amp; so many others at @GavinNewsom's inauguration. Looking forward to working alongside them to strengthen our state and towards an even brighter future for CA. https://t.co/DqAreq8lMw
The President is being hypocritical. He should not endanger our military readiness and upend the lives of our service-members and their families for a senseless border wall that does nothing to further national security. #CA39 https://t.co/UMKjdGvTS6
I am incredibly honored to be the representative for the 39th District and will put in the hard work that’s necessary to be a responsive, dedicated, and responsible Representative. https://t.co/zshlOWkyle
All in all a successful first week for #GilontheHill. I will continue to fight for issues that matter -- like fighting for protections for those with pre-existing conditions, common-sense gun legislation, humane immigration reform, &amp; critical infrastructure investments. https://t.co/ku7vQ8qVNx
We even made a new hire. Welcome #CA39's first ever Press Puppy. He is ready to bring the "paw" in pawlitics. https://t.co/g7Srdv3SR3
I also was able to stand with my colleagues to introduce HR 1-- a bill that aims to take big money out of politics, protect our electoral system, increase voter participation, and ensure fair and honest campaign processes. https://t.co/6OTa90TVK0
Having my family be with me was an honor. My boys were very excited to join me on the Floor as I took my Oath, and my wife and parents were able to watch from above in the Gallery. It will be a day I will treasure forever. https://t.co/AvfVFWsgDa
This week was filled with many highlights -- including getting the keys to our new office in Cannon 431, where I hope to see and meet many of my constituents and supporters. https://t.co/MWoGH94qOv
I’m privileged to now be in a position to be a voice for our community's values &amp; give the people of our district the representation they deserve. I've heard from many of you &amp; will always welcome everyone and their positions, even if they are different than mine.
The road to this week was long and challenging, but also rewarding. I set out to represent #CA39 because I felt an obligation to serve my community and our country. It will continue to be my number one priority as your Representative.
