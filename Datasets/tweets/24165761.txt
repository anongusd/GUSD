p.s. anyone in the tech industry who is looking to hire recent college grads and would like me to send you her cover letter and resume, DM me your email and I will send it on Monday.
Today, I didn't do anything special. I took a meeting. An hour of my day. I did what all of us who've had a little success in life should do. Uplift the next generation. Believe in them. Mentor them.		I have been blessed with amazing mentors in my life. Just paying it forward.
I told her to work on her resume and cover letter this weekend (incorporating the notes we went over during today‚Äôs meeting) and come back to my office on Monday and I would send it out to 20 people personally.		I was incredibly inspired by her determination and resilience.
She told me she sent her resume around to a number of companies and got no response. 		We sat for 20 minutes and worked on her resume. And then another 20 minutes on her cover letter. And then 10 more minutes on her confidence. 		She majors in computer science and economics.
I asked her how many people she had reached out to of the people whose business cards she kept...she said every single one. And all she asked for was a chance to sit down and ask for advice. Wasn‚Äôt even asking for a job.		And I was the only one who responded.
@GirlsWhoCode I sat with her for an hour and she told me that she kept everyone‚Äôs business card  from the people she had met since she was a kid. Dozens of cards...		She is now a senior at Spelman College and is graduating in May and looking for a job.
Short thread.		Just met with an amazing young woman, who had visited my office in 2011 when she was in a program called @GirlsWhoCode. I gave all of the kids my business card and she kept it for eight years.		She reached out to me in December and asked if I could meet with her.

@rob_bennett Where‚Äôs your beard!?!?!!
I have filed a claim and my computer is password protected, but I would love to get it back. There was a Delta agent in MIA at the ticket counter who was very helpful to me and I felt like she was going to track it down. But she has gone ghost on me since 3PM.
So... I left my laptop on the plane today. (@Delta flight 2190. JFK ‚Äî&gt; MIA, seat 11E). The turnaround for the next flight was quick, so the cleaning crew maybe didn‚Äôt see it and it went back to JFK on flight 1274. Delta said they would check plane but I haven‚Äôt heard back. Help?

Stop telling young people that they are not going to vote. They have already turned out in record numbers during early voting. And on Tuesday they will show up!		Support them. 	Inspire them. 	Encourage them. 	Appreciate them. 	Thank them. 	Respect them. 	Vote with them.
The swing voter in the midterms will not be the Republican to Democrat or Democrat to Republican. 		It will be the non-voter to voter. 		Young people, 	this is your moment.	This is your movement.	This is your election. 	This is your time to win.
Georgia's young voter turnout is four times higher than it was in 2014. In Arizona, three times as many younger voters are turning up.
In some states, the increase in youth turnout is staggering. In TX, 332,000 voters under 30 have cast ballots already, up nearly five fold from the 2014 midterms. In NV, the 25,000 young voters who have cast a ballot is also five times higher than in the same period 4 yrs ago.
The number of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who have cast ballots early has surpassed turnout levels from the last midterm election in just about every state.

RT @MattxRed: Thread:		Florida will never forget about Trayvon. #RepealStandYourGround https://t.co/T4vMwPqOr4
Justice for Trayvon Martin.
I fight against my own stereotypes and my own suspicions. I fight for people whose ancestors built this country, literally, and who are still treated like second class citizens.  Being quiet is not an option, for we have been too quiet for too long.
So, I fight for Trayvon Martin. I fight for Amadou Diallo. I fight for Rodney King. I fight for every young black man who looks ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù to someone who thinks they have the right to take away their freedom to walk through their own neighborhood.
So I‚Äôve made the choice today to tell my white friends that the rights I take for granted are only valid if I fight to give those same rights to others.  The taxi cab. The purse. The meal. The police car. The police. These are all things I‚Äôve taken for granted.
Cause I had on that same outfit yesterday and no one called 911 saying I was just wandering around their neighborhood.  It was because of one thing and one thing only.  Trayvon is black.
Before the bullet hit him dead in the chest.  Before all of this.  He was suspicious.  He was suspicious. suspicious. And you know, like I know, it wasn‚Äôt because of the hoodie or the jeans or the sneakers.
Let‚Äôs be very, very clear. Before the neighborhood watch captain, George Zimmerman, started following him against the better judgement of the 911 dispatcher.  Before any altercation.  Before any self-defense claim.  Before Travyon‚Äôs cries for help were heard on the 911 tapes.
For heaven‚Äôs sake, for 24 hours he was a deceased John Doe at the hospital because even the police couldn‚Äôt believe that maybe he LIVES in the community.   There are still some facts to figure out. There are still some questions to be answered.  But, let‚Äôs be clear.
Not even a trending topic for the young man.		We‚Äôve heard the 911 calls. We seen the 13 year old witness.  We‚Äôve read the letter from the alleged killer‚Äôs father.  We listened to the anger of the family‚Äôs attorney.  We‚Äôve felt the pain of Trayvon‚Äôs mother.
Some bracelets. Even tweeted at Rihanna to take a stance.  But, a 17 year old American kid is followed and then ultimately killed by a neighborhood vigilante who happens to be carrying a semi-automatic weapon and my white friends are quiet.  Eerily quiet.
I mean, it was only two weeks ago when almost every white person I knew was tweeting about stopping a brutal African warlord from killing more innocent children.  And they even took thirty minutes out of their busy schedules to watch a movie about dude.  They bought t-shirts.
Racially profiled. Race. America‚Äôs elephant that never seems to leave the room. But, the part that doesn‚Äôt sit well with me is that all of the messengers of this message are all black too.
I got a lot of emails about Trayvon.  I have read a lot of articles.  I have seen a lot of television segments.  The message is consistent.  Most of the commentators, writers, op-ed pages agree.  Something went wrong.  Trayvon was murdered.
After all, I was raised in hip-hop‚Ä¶part of our dress code.  I digress.  Back to Trayvon and the gated community in Sanford, Florida, where he was visiting his father.
‚ÄúSuspicious.‚Äù that is what the guy who killed him said he looked like cause he had on a black hoodie, a pair of jeans and white sneakers.  But, remember I had on that same outfit yesterday.  And yes my Air Force Ones were ‚Äúbrand-new‚Äù clean.
The ball is in my court.		So, today I decided to hit the ball.  Making a choice.  A choice to stand up for Trayvon Martin. 17 years old. black. innocent. murdered with a bag of skittles and a bottle of ice tea in his hands.
Privileged to never look suspicious. I have no guilt for the color of my skin or the privilege that I have. Remember, it was just the next card that came out of the deck. But, I have choices. I got choices on how I play the hand I was dealt. I got a lot of options.
I was born white.  It was the card I was dealt.  No choice in the matter.  Just the card handed out by the dealer. I have lived my whole life privileged. Privileged to be born without a glass ceiling. Privileged to grow up in the richest country in the world.
I will never have to pay before I eat. And I certainly will never get ‚Äústopped and frisked.‚Äù  I will never look suspicious to you, because of one thing and one thing only.  The color of my skin.  I am white.
I will never witness someone clutch their purse tightly against their body as they walk by me.  I won‚Äôt have to worry about a police car following me for two miles, so they can ‚Äúrun my plates.‚Äù
‚Ä¶in fact, that is what I wore yesterday‚Ä¶I still will never look suspicious. No matter how much the hoodie covers my face or how baggie my jeans are, I will never look out of place to you. I will never watch a taxi cab pass me by to pick someone else up.
The first piece I wrote about Trayvon Martin was on March 19 2012, just 20 days after he was killed.		--		White People, You Will Never Look Suspicious Like Trayvon Martin!		I will never look suspicious to you. Even if I have a black hoodie, a pair of jeans and white sneakers on‚Ä¶
