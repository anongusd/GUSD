ok, i actually do have to go and walk this very fidgety dog.  thanks for all your insights and to @TheCoffeeKlatch for inviting me! #tck
RT @TCKModerators: Please help spread awareness of our event Communicate to Educate at http://tweetchat.com/room/tck Please Retweet #tck
@ihave7monsters larger diapers if tightness around the legs is an issue, also cloth (gulp) diapers?  soft pants over them are a must #tck
RT @bcIMthemommy: @autismfather I did find silk long johns at Walmart of all places for my daughter.  in the womans althletic section. #tck
@autismfather It can be knit like cotton jersey--unfortunately more expensive :( we strive to keep our clothing affordable #tck
@CorinaBecker yes! it's a big priority for us--but not until 2011 Fall #tck
@autismfather We are looking into using silk--much warmer and also soft with seams that can be sewn flat--silk long johns can help #tck
@TCKModerators It was a pleasure. I will stick around for a bit if anyone has more questions about sensory issues/clothing--DM me! #tck
@SSDOGS here is my dog helping me with the tweet chat! Nice to meet you--wonderful work you are doing! #tck http://twitpic.com/3315ow
the differences (awareness vs understanding):being friends rather than just classmates?...helping rather than ignoring? what else?  #tck
in the classroom, there is a big diff btw being aware of the kid with autism, and understanding and accepting him/her #tck
RT @SSDOGS: Many people may have heard of #autism, but they only see limitations. They dont see abilities and future prospects. #tck
RT: With knowledge,parents seek early Diagnosis which brings early intervention support+accommodations.Is this not better 4 family? YES #tck
man it is hard to keep these tweets short! #tck
RT @autismfather: A very true post, and why I push for Autism Understanding and Awareness (#AUA) instead of Autism Awareness #tck
advocacy and awareness has always been about speaking out, not keeping quiet.  #tck
@lovelylicious as a teacher in nyc kids can go without label till age 5--but that often means without services as well #tck
I chose to communicate because i have seen how powerful social media is to raise awareness about these issues from the source #tck
why did everyone choose communication over communication shut down?   #tck
RT @FriendshipCircl: Check this video out! http://youtu.be/CoqaNG0Ozqc the amazing qualities of #specialneeds #nowplaying #tck
@SSDOGS that is so wonderful. I would love to learn more.  I have a dog and am thinking of training her to be a therapy dog. #tck
@SSDOGS what are some of the things a task trained dog can do? #tck
RT: @bcIMthemommy my fit kit includes hand-out cards explain I have autism and having sensory overload; and items that soothe me #tck
Me too!RT @ParentingSPD: Had a hard time logging into Twitter today.The system was "OVERLOADED". So much for a communication shutdown!  #tck
@bcIMthemommy Well welcome--let us know if you have any specific questions--lots of great and supportive people in this chat	 #tck
I fully agree: RT @Sensorystkids: RT @AutismMomExpert: @ParentingSPD He wants to be accepted as he is. Acceptance is the answer.  #tck
welcome @bcIMthemommy! How old is your daughter? #tck
RT @TheCoffeeKlatch: Help promote our 24hr #Autism Event 11/1 http://alturl.com/ig3pe we have an outstanding line up of guests  #tck
@SSDOGS somehow that is not surprising--do you then focus on how the dog can help in other areas of the child's life? #tck
@TheCoffeeKlatch yes, meltdowns are often related to sensory issues.  Meltdowns are a way of communicating #tck
@SSDOGS Is that a common problem you encounter?  Schools not letting task and other trained dogs in the school? #tck
@jenhsmomsp2 These meltdown cards are a wonderful idea--I made something similar when I was teaching in an inclusive classroom #tck
RT @Alicia033: Shut-out day? Dont be silent, let your voices be heard! #ASDay #autism #tck
@ParentingSPD bye Hartley!  this is truly amazing! #tck
