CJ Roberts says no Obama, Bush, or Clinton judges. Did he miss the Garland and Kavanaugh battles? The two political parties think judges embody the appointing president’s philosophy. So what is Roberts up to? Anticipating having to rule on Mueller’s subpoena of Trump?
Here's my new Marketwatch op-ed on Trump's correct approach to China trade. Free-traders focus narrowly on their favorite theory, which does not encompass geo-politics, while anti-Trumpers dismiss everything he does. But Trump is right on China trade. https://t.co/ik6rd3NI8F

US needs 7 nm manufacturing onshore - for technology,  economic, and national security reasons. Taiwanese and Korean manufacturers could be destroyed in foreseeable future conflicts. Notion that US can always just import defense needs is nonsense. https://t.co/hu7hhVlKAO
Short- vs long-term focus of US corporate leaders has been debated for decades. Quarterly reporting is just one item on the list of impediments to corporations' competing better globally.  Trump right to raise issue in calling for half-yearly reporting. https://t.co/gROEs1PxgN
@RocCityBuilt If he gets it, why is he bragging about strong dollar? He has been inconsistent here. Instability in Turkey could set off flight from lira and other currencies to dollar, strengthening it. He can direct Treasury to intervene in FX mkts to lower dollar, or at least talk it down.
@eagleone1776 @arappeport Ill-informed comment, just like your first one. Once he doubles the national debt, it will be too late to talk as the economy melts down.
@eagleone1776 @arappeport I criticized Obama for years about rapid increases in the national debt. His passivity was almost criminal. But if the plane is flying at 10,000 feet and the mountain is 16,000, and you replace the pilot for negligence, does the new pilot get a pass when he hits the mountain?
Some advisor please explain to the President that a strong dollar hurts US exports/companies/workers and negates the effect of his tariffs, especially with the yuan dropping rapidly. Further, the Republican economic miracle is occurring with massive/accelerating federal debt. https://t.co/8XpbC6K8QX
@BillGertz DOJ/FBI ramping up to counter foreign ops and propaganda. New DOJ report:	The goal of foreign influence operations is to destabilize society and undermine confidence in democratic institutions, impacting political sentiment and public discourse. US left apparently has same goals.
Recall the Vietnam War major’s quote reported by Peter Arnett: “It bcame necessary to destroy the town to save it.” Today for the left/MSM/Deep State/abusive prosecutors/activist judges/antifa it has become: We must destroy American democracy in order to save it.
@DavidAFrench It’s hard to quantify but many of the ‘American despair deaths’ you rightly lament are the result of lives/ families/communities ruined by trade policies you and NR champion. Does it occur to you that you might be one of the fiddlers?
@michael_stumo 1985 Plaza Accord was last time USG seriously took on rigged currency prices as prime factor in US trade deficits. The dollar devaluation had dramatic effect on trade deficit, showing mkts respond to price. Sadly, US undid Plaza w/ Louvre Accord, and our 'allies' resumed cheating
Nine EU states sign off on joint military intervention force. Now maybe the Europeans can handle local conflicts, like Bosnia/Serbia and Libya, without US; and keep SLOCs open themselves. Let's spend that extra $200 billion on industrial competitiveness. https://t.co/mK9Qkggvbp
@wexler @sdonnan By 'builds' you mean assembles. What is the breakdown of the origin of the parts? Are engine/drive-train imported from Germany? What is the US parts and labor content? The Japanese defeated Reagan's VRAs in the 1980s. Is BMW following suit? Lots more to know than 'builds.'
@sdonnan I'll say it again too. The fact trade balance is not a P&amp;L statement doesn't mean it is a random statistic as you seem to imply. Borrowing from foreigners for 40 yrs to buy their goods shows a lack of competitiveness. Buying a lot things one can't afford is no measure of success.
@sdonnan Shallow! A country borrowing madly from foreigners to pay for imports (that were invented/used to be made there) is one not generating sufficient wealth selling exports. Shortfalls in production/wealth creation at home can mean shortfalls in tax revenue, thus fiscal deficits.
@sdonnan 2-BTW, your favorite trade theory holds a country's trade imbalance will be eliminated by markets mechanisms, but 40+ years of US imbalances not eliminated by markets. Why? Theory doesn't apply to reserve currency country plus markets are manipulated, not fully free. Spout on!
@sdonnan 1-Such profound myopia! Trade balance is not a P&amp;L statement, but does provide insight into a country's competitiveness. Buying a lot of things (with money borrowed from foreigners as opposed to earned by selling our things to them) is not necessarily a good. Ask any bankrupt.
Watching MSNBC/CNN today, I now understand America’s moral obligation to take all the world’s manufactured goods and immigrants/refugees. To reject any good or any person will diminish our standing with friend&amp;foe. We must be a nation of imports/immigrants. Costs are irrelevant.
@justinamash Perhaps the most inapposite, idiotic free-trader claim: I run a trade deficit with my grocer. You don’t ‘trade’ with your grocer. US doesn’t have a barter economy. You use cash/credit/debit/etc. Your grocer can’t manipulate currency or levy taxes, tariffs, or destroy your income.
Re NK summit warning to US: Kim's 2nd meeting with Xi in China, Xi's hinting he may show up in Singapore, and Trump's cave to Xi on ZTE are all likely factors in the murdering thug Kim's reversion to form. Also unrealistic to think all US demands satisfied in one summit meeting.
North Korea warns US it could pull out of planned summit. Kim charm offensive abruptly stops; he reverts to hothead, murderous thug dictator that he is. Trump right to try breakthrough, but Nobel talk was always premature, as are "I-told-you-so's" now. https://t.co/UoIIUy2yvt
@AIA_WillLiu I was being ironic. All the ‘experts’ and talking heads claiming TPP will somehow magically alter China’s rising trajectory don’t have a clue about China and how its party/state/business consirtium works. TPP will stop China just as WTO membership did.

@RealJamesWoods @realDonaldTrump Xi is playing Trump with his vague pledges. What needs to change is entire economic/business system, not just autos (Xi wants battery/self-driving tech) and finance. The marriage of party, govt, and industry is designed to hollow out US, expel us from E. Asia. No victory here.
Two best tools for @POTUS to rebalance trade are a VAT (WTO legal) and a competitively priced dollar. Selective tariffs hurt US manufacturing, should be across-the-board. Many US and fgn co's must buy Chinese inputs. When only US co pays 30% tariff, loses to fgn competitor.
Giving the devil (Summers here) his due: "US producers who use Chinese inputs lose competitiveness when only they are forced to pay tariffs." True, absolutely. If Japanese co &amp; US co use same Chinese inputs, US co paying 30% tariff loses to fgn competitor. https://t.co/mp6jayJSh4
How economists mislead: Summers (Krugman too): China's trade surpluses as GDP % much lower now than last decade. True but cause? China GDP quadrupled thus making surpluses relatively not absolutely smaller. Surplus w/ US went up 40%. Obscurantism. https://t.co/mp6jayJSh4
Former Treas Sec Summers giving aid and comfort to Chinese juggernaut. Lots of misdirection: e.g., FTAs reduced fgn tariff barriers much more than US barriers. True but fgn VATs were raised after each mkt-opening round to take place of lower tariffs.  https://t.co/mp6jayJSh4
@realDonaldTrump Xi is not going to take any actions that benefit US interests unless they advance his own economic and political agenda. China has rolled your three predecessors. You are trying to dismantle their economic system. Have they really caved so easily? Or are they playing you?
NYT op-ed: How Trump Misunderstands Trade. Better: How Economists Misunderstand Reality. Phony assumptions, straw men, misdirection, fabrications. Trade deficits w/ 1/2 countries don't matter = trade deficits never matter, even 40 years with most countries https://t.co/DYYDfqBAO2
NYT op-ed by libertarian shows convincingly why the US economy is far too important to be left to economists as they try to stuff reality into their inadequate models, which BTW don't factor in such things as global power politics and military developments https://t.co/DYYDfqBAO2
Xi's pledges today = worthless. China will study, delay, negotiate further. It will not dismantle its economic structures/SOEs that give rise to massive US trade deficit. Why would it, esp if Americans will be tricked by empty promises. Wake up, America! https://t.co/b6RMwR94uL
Hard to believe Xi's repeat pledge today to cut tariffs/open some sectors being touted as Trump victory. Let's get serious: Xi's cosmetic, no-details promises are bait he's dangling to hook gullible Americans while juggernauting toward Made in China 2025.  https://t.co/b6RMwR94uL
If there is an upside to the FBI raid on Cohn’s office, it is a warning to @POTUS not to appear before Mueller in person but only to answer written questions. (1) Trump must preserve the Office of the Presidency. (2) To adapt the old saying, Mueller could indict a ham sandwich.
@POTUS in effect asking China to change its entire economic/political system  to Western democratic/business model. Roles of party, state, SOEs, banking, finance, etc. need reinvention. We failed at this with Japan. Not going to happen w China. Hope there is contingency plan.
Changing China-US economic/trade/security dynamic is critically necessary, but painful, multi-year process. US holds better hand than China, but Xi better able to manage pain domestically than Trump. Does Trump admin have the concentration/stamina to see the job thru. Hope so.
US trade deficits with China are in large part result of Chinese business/state/party system. Party now more powerful than ever, esp with Xi for life. Even if Xi agreed (Ha!) to major change,  revamping is multi-year, structural process. Quick fix to deficit problem impossible.
Chinese SOEs really big problem for global competitors. US unable to persuade China to scrap them so far. They are a focal point where party, state, business merge. Unlikely Trump tariffs/follow-on negotiations will unwind them. Just one illustration of what US/West is up against
Chinese tariffs well designed to target various House seats, esp in red states. Is China seeking to interfere in US mid-term to cripple Trump by helping blue wave? Much less subtle than Russian interference. Economists’ models don’t include political effects of globalization.
Multiple US admins tried with little success to change Japanese business/economic system. Large trade deficits/closed markets persist. Lesson there for Trump who appears to think he can change China in short order and garner headlines. China needs to change but not a quick hitter
@POTUS not adequately prepared Am people for China 301. Requires more than news conference remarks &amp; tweets claiming trade war is easy win for deficit country. See, e.g., Pres Nixon's 8/15/71 Oval Office address. There will be pain; Trump must explain/call for shared sacrifice.
@sdonnan Come on! You're smarter than your question. Many factors go into a quarter, and it's still short term. Trump is trying, inartfully, to reverse 16 years of Chinese mercantilism (counting from WTO entry), IP theft, forced technology transfer, etc. Is 1/4 good measure of success?
@sdonnan Daily stock market movements are a poor tool to gauge the success/failure of any long-term policy, trade included.
@POTUS unhelpful to own trade policy tweeting about ease of winning trade war. Truth is it’s a tough, protracted battle trying to reorient US economy for 21st century success after 70 yrs of dystopian US policies/fgn trade cheating. Use Oval Office to explain goals to Am people.
Do the many critics of Trump’s trade policies really think the pre-Trump approach to trade is sustainable? That adding to the US trade policies that got us into the current mess will get us out? That the world will continue to take our dollars/bonds for their goods forever?
Faster than one can say ‘trade war,’ there are thousands of instant pundits lamenting (possible ) loss of shareholder value and loss of jobs. Why weren’t they concerned the last 16 years, as subsidized Chinese companies displaced US market share, factories, jobs?
USTR releases Chinese  tariff list. US farmers worried abt retaliation. Ok, let’s not challenge China &amp; so abandon our industrial/technology future for current farm profits. Farmers better hope China buys entire output b/c no one here will have $ to do so https://t.co/NYNouU4FMD
@DanRDimicco @RocCityBuilt @ScottPaulAAM It is fact that China (EU, others) manipulate US industry/ag groups + public opinion to defeat Trump trade policy. Entire media/many industry groups opposed to Trump. My point: Oval office address to explain struggle &amp; goals to Am people, call for shared sacrifice. Nixon 8/15/71.
3) Trump 301 initiative is real deal, technology driven. Aims to thwart #MIC2025. But can USTR put national tech strategy together? Economic planning not strong US suit, USG has few knowledgeable agencies. Treasury, e.g., can't draw up non-invest list b/c it has no tech insight
2) Trump stratagem to have China pick $100B in deficit reduction is limited financial gambit. China won't comply, and will not pick items critical to #MIC2025. China's trade strategy core is tech acquisition, so Trump strategic plan must be technology-based, not financially-based
1) Does Trump fully understand tariff objectives? Trying to lower US trade deficits=impt goal. They matter b/c financed with foreign borrowing/asset sales, and displace factories/jobs, killing communities. But financial approach only insufficient, ignores technology/manufacturing
2)As China responds, Trump needs to show better leadership on trade, explain to Am people how his tariffs work to counter cheating, reorder trade patterns, rebalance US &amp; global economy. Must explain it's a big job, w/ shared sacrifice - or China will turn many voters against him
1) China will respond to $50B in new U.S. tariffs. Trump problem: US not only one able to target specific industries. US democracy means China has political leverage here to counter trade policies. No like political leverage for US in China.  https://t.co/l5DtJJsQrm
WSJ now worried abt 'collateral damage' from Trump trade policy. But silent for years on direct&amp;collateral damage to US industry/technology/IP/private data from illegal China practices. WSJ strategy for US: Trump should shut up, do nothing, accept cheating https://t.co/lzJ5ZK0nyM
The purpose of a nation’s economy is not efficiency. That’s why orthodox economy theory is of limited value, as are the economists who blindly embrace it, in shaping the US national economy.
@CDrakeFairTrade Using trade laws for their intended purpose - to counter various foreign unfair trade practices - is not protectionism. US trade law recognizes there can be wrongdoing in the trade arena that must be rectified so US producers/workers can operate under fair conditions.
VW's-Woebcken: 'There-is-no-winner-with-protectionism.' So why do auto producers' nations  practice it in multiple ways, e.g., Germany's currency cheating. Fgn plants open here, but US plants close, maybe no net new jobs. Rents don't accrue to US benefit. https://t.co/XZsRI4JIeP

@sdonnan Meiji proverb says: Rich Country, Strong Army. Countries don’t become powers based on services trade. Most services involve wealth transfer, not wealth creation. Services affix to manufactured goods, wealth created by manufacturing, or higher living stds thru manu/R&amp;D/technology.
@StuySquare Yes, German ‘system’ critical problem, manipulating currency not just recently but since end of WWII. Trump/Navarro attacked Merkel/Germany one year ago, were strongly rebuffed. US should adopt German system: VAT, currency, Mittelstand, etc. Nixon&amp;Reagan fought currency, failed.
@StuySquare I don’t think it’s as easy as you do. Further, while more service exports would bring down US trade deficit, and thus are good, it’s manufacturing that creates wealth and leads to future industries. Services generally move wealth around (admittedly good in this case).
@realDonaldTrump Precise knowledge is critical for a president, including the composition of goods/services, commodities/advanced tech products, ag versus manufacturing. US needs a strategic plan to compete and get to future industries from current ones. Your approach lacks depth/precision.

RE Sec 232 tariffs, EU Trade Commissioner Malmstrom says,"We cannot possibly be a threat to national security of US." Here's how: EU/NATO trade distorting practices + low defense spending, both at US expense. US picks up defense burden, while EU invests in commercial competition.
If tariffs are terrible and set off ‘trade wars’ and US should just accept steel overcapacity/other trade distorting practices (such as VATs, currency games, forced tech transfer), then why are EU, China retaliating w/ tariffs? Why don’t they follow US ‘wisdom’ &amp; avoid tariffs?

Opponents claim tariffs have NEVER worked, or brought prosperity. They selectively cite cases going back to 1930. BUT they make a major historical omission: USA from 1789-1945 grew into world’s preeminent econ/tech power using tariffs. (They probably have alternate explanation.)
@RocCityBuilt BTW, I agree on need for quick, across-the-board action. Are there upcoming 232 cases, any ITC cases on which he could take quick action? If not, what section of trade law would grant @POTUS authority to take all-encompassing action?
@RocCityBuilt Currency intervention under IMF emergency rules quickest. Nixon/Reagan 1971/1985 acted decisively/quickly. VAT is across-the-board, WTO legal, can’t be challenged as would BAT (the way DISC and FSC were in 1976 and 1999). What authority would @POTUS use to impose broad tariffs?

I have a study that shows talking heads who cite DC think tank studies are often misled or just plain wrong, especially when study confirms their prejudices.
@wsjemre @willmauldin @wto 3- So EU used to playing a winning hand with WTO/retaliatory tariffs. Difference this time, however, is that Trump could well disregard WTO decision or pull US out of WTO altogether. It’s entirely witin the realm of possibility.
@wsjemre @willmauldin @wto 2-EU has long and successful history of challenging US legally at GATT/WTO. See, for example, defeats of US tax laws to counter trade-distorting effects of EU VATs. Also of turning US senators and reps with targeted tariffs. (interference in our democracy?)
@wsjemre @willmauldin @wto 1-EU, which began life as oligopoly Iron and Steel Community, is afraid China-steel coming into US  directly/thru 3rd countries will now be diverted to EU. W/ across-the-board Trump tariff, EU can’t counter China/maintain production sending steel to US. Solution: attack inept US.

Empty heads dismissing Trump’s use of Sec 232 national security rationale for sectoral tariffs to save steel/alum know nothing about ‘know-how,’ process technology, R&amp;D contributions. No manufacturing = much less wealth. Remember Meiji proverb: Rich country, strong army.
From Nixon’s 8/15/71 10% across-the-board surcharge on imports thru Obama’s tire tariffs, no president has face the vitriol/hysteria from conventional wisdom-ossified minds than has Trump with two minor sectoral tariffs. No need for facts, analysis, perspective, history w Trump.
@ChuckRossDC @lukerosiak @DailyCaller But as Andrew McCarthy has often pointed out, Steele was not the SOURCE of the dossier’s information. He amalgamated information from Russian sources, who were not checked out by FBI, as far as we know, and who by definition are unreliable.
@sahilkapur @willmauldin @POTUS @AshLeeStrong Way and Means Republicans included an across-the-board 20 % tax on imports in the Ryan/Brady tax plan, much better for all US manufacturing  than tariffs. (They let retailers’ lobbying defeat them.) Now they are concerned that sector-specific tariffs are not precise enough!
@davidfrum Are you referring to the Chinese, Japanese, other East Asians, the Germans, or other Europeans?
Trump often accused of looking to past with trade policy. A few industry-specific tariffs are not going to restore post-WWII heyday. But, combined with others measures, may prevent further industrial decline and engender renaissance based on new industries.
@sdonnan 6-Observation: EU/many others gaming international trading system in numerous ways since GATT instituted. All US attempts to create a VAT-like structure legally challenged. This is a high-stakes game about wealth, power, jobs. US has played poorly. But game-changer may be DJT.
@sdonnan 5-EU challenged FSC in 1999; a WTO panel ruled it non-complaint in 2000. Congress passed the ETI law later in 2000, and at EU behest the WTO ruled it non-compliant in 2001. Additionally, it allowed the EU to levy $4 billion of tariffs against US products if no timely US repeal.
@sdonnan 4-DISC was largely abandoned after a GATT panel found problems with it &amp; certain European tax laws in 1976. The matter was wrapped into the Tokyo Round. In 1984, Congress created the Foreign Sales Corporation, in another try at a VAT-like tax structure in the US to boost exports.
@sdonnan 3-The US tried negotiation unsuccessfully. In 1971, Congress created the Domestic International Sales Corporation through tax law as a response to European VATs. The purpose was to offset the export-subsidy effects of the VAT export rebate.
@sdonnan 2-Many European nations followed France as did the rest of the world. 166 of 199 OECD nations now use a VAT. By the Johnson administration it was clear that VATs were being exploited for trade purposes. Tariff-cutting trade rounds were offset by countries' raising their VATs.
@sdonnan 1-Knowledge of economic/tax/business history is useful in this discussion. When GATT took effect 1/1/48, there were no VATs - although the US had foolishly agreed to treat direct and indirect taxation differently for trade purposes. France put in the first post-WWII VAT in 1954.

@GovWalker @jendeben @POTUS Gov Walker latest victim of foreign divide-and-conquer trade strategy. Wants to capitulate to save his state while industry savaged nationwide. EU targeting Wisc Harleys for retaliation, along w Kentucky bourbon. Point: coopt Ryan and McConnell. Fgn manipulation of US politics!
@GordonGChang If only it were true - that there is even one in the elites who will ‘pull the trigger’ on tariffs/trade cheating. The massive hysterical reaction to Trump tariffs shows orthodoxy grips the MSM-pol-econ-academic-business mind. Nixon/Reagan tried but failed. Trump is sui generis.
@realDonaldTrump True that 150+ of our trading partners impose value-added taxes at their borders, some as high as 25%, An across-the-board tax/tariff with a rebate for exports puts US on equal footing. So why did you let the retail industry/your advisors strip the idea from tax bill?
Simplistic, historically inaccurate article by the agitated never-Trumper David Frum, who claims inter alia Nixon caused 70s stagflation w import surcharge. Pls ignore Johnson’s Guns-and-Butter Vietnam War funding. Trump's Tariffs Repeat Nixon's Mistakes https://t.co/3jSVEK2QTx

CNN's @GloriaBorger says tariff plan "wasn't even vetted." Wrong! Sec 232 report completed last June. Tariffs have been vetted endlessly since then. Many Cabinet officials opposed. They made their arguments; @potus decided; they lost. Vetting doesn't mean they get to prevail.
"Trump Trade War" phrase used every minute on CNN &amp; other networks. Fact-devoid claim apparently justified by existing anti-Trump hysteria. How about waiting to see foreign response? Oh, it might undermine your narrative.
Media theme: 'chaos in Trump administration' due to tariffs. When @potus hires staff not supportive of but radically opposed to his programs (e.g. Cohn), they claim chaos as he moves ahead despite their efforts. New hires must support Trump programs, not save country from them.

@KatyKayBBC canard: countries that trade don't go to war with each other. She excludes WWI (occurred after fifty yrs of massive trade liberalization) and pre-WWII trade with Hitler regime. China's aggressive military buildup in S China Sea=no problem b/c deep trade relationship.
@SRuhle This tweet is too stupid to bother to take apart.
@jonathanvswan Explanations are futile because they are not true. Trade deficits subtract from GDP under national income accounting. More important, they have to be financed. If country doesn't earn enough with exports to pay for imports - it has to sell assets or borrow. US has been doing both
Country w large deficit, vs country w large surplus, wins trade war, by definition. Perhaps both are harmed, but majority hurt goes to surplus country, which can’t earn same high profits through exporting. E Asia &amp; EU losers.
Politico header parrots globalists' tariff war hype w/o any proof/discussion. Says Gary Cohn, global banker, may leave WH as result of tariffs. Cohn never supported Pres on trade, in fact tried to submarine him. This is staff- not Pres-induced chaos. Bye! https://t.co/J7Ip1seBw7
Really inept tariff rollout Mr Pres. You campaigned on tariffs, ordered 232 inquiry - finished months ago. But announce it off-the-cuff, with no details, no implementing docs, no WH talking points, no Cabinet officials preemptively refuting globalist hysteria &amp; calming mkts. BAD!
Really sloppy job on tariffs today. Where were Ross, Lighthizer, Navarro? Why didn't they have coordinated talking points ready to support the president immediately. Facts would have refuted globalists' trade-war hysteria and calmed markets. What was Kelly's role in this debacle?
@realDonaldTrump Really inept tariff rollout. You campaigned on tariffs, ordered 232 investigation, finished months ago. But announce it off-the-cuff, with no details, no implementing docs, no WH talking points, no Cabinet officials preemptively refuting globalist hysteria &amp; calming mkts. BAD!
Problem with tariffs imposed/announced to date: not comprehensive enough. All US manufacturing under attack, not just steel, aluminum, solar panels, washing machines. Tax cuts/industry-specific tariffs a start but must be part of larger industry/technology strategy to restore US.
Trump says he’ll impose 25% steel, 10% aluminum tariffs. Formal announcement next week. Let’s see all details, to know whether globalists/ally-lovers in administration create exceptions. Expect lots of trade war/retaliation alarmism from foreigners/pundits.

Problem w/ steel tariff recommendations is not they start a trade war but don't go far enough. Most sectors hurting from illegal fgn trade practices. Tariffs should be all industries across-the-board! Border-adjustable tax did that, but Trump/Mnuchen/Cohen blew it. Importers won!

DoC publishes Section 232 steel/aluminum results. Recommends curbing flow into US by various means. Response: Trade war, retaliation, lost US jobs, higher consumer prices, allies hurt, China angry!!! Solution: US should voluntarily give up industries, make other countries happy.

@demandmyth 'Sky-high tariffs?' I haven't seen any, don't expect to. Look at fate of border-adjustable tax, in effect a 20 percent tariff. When Laura Ing. asked Paul Ryan what happened, the Speaker said "the retailers won." The retailers crushed the tariff aspect of the Ryan-Brady tax plan!
@CalebGerold @Walmart I go after Walmart because THEY are currently running ads on Twitter virtue-signaling their new program after crushing so many American businesses and their employees. Have you ever heard of a target of opportunity?
@CalebGerold @Walmart A shill for WalMart! Maybe you can do PR for their new program. If you knew anything about Sam Walton, you'd know he practiced Buy American. The next generations did not. That's why they populate Forbes' richest list. And they most certainly squeezed their US suppliers.
@RocCityBuilt Only problem with your analysis is Trump is not 'acting accordingly.' There are no sweeping actions. The globalists inside the administration (and out) have halted decisive action. And BTW Nafta = undercard event. Canada/Mexico incapable of exploiting US for global dominance.
You would have CHEATED just as the Chinese did, Mr Pres? Taking advantage of past administrations after you pledged to adhere to the WTO/IMF rules. So that's your policy foundation/morality? Oh, yeah. I forgot. All those contractors you stiffed on your casinos and buildings https://t.co/deG4rcQrrf
China cheated, Mr. Pres. It's a fact! Currency manipulation, forced IP transfer, state subsidies, no-cost loans, theft of US gov't/business data, etc. It was conscious, elaborately planned. If thieves rob a bank where the police are incompetent, are the thieves ok? No! https://t.co/deG4rcQrrf
Your speech on China trade was really ill-informed, Mr Pres. We SHOULD blame China for CHEATING because they violated the conditions of their WTO accession, and they violated the IMF charter by currency manipulation. Past administrations didn't cheat, the Chinese did and do! https://t.co/deG4rcQrrf
Then why, Mr President, are you stalling on the Section 232 cases on steel and aluminum, which have been ready since June? And where are the two other studies you ordered by E.O. on the Chinese forcing IP transfer and causes of the trade deficit? We remember, even if you don't! https://t.co/X88rBhD1oo
Walmart pretends it's part of the solution. But by forcing US manufacturers to meet the 'China price' or die, Walmart terminated the futures of many US companies/workers.

2) It's simple: Results of trade as practiced? Lower wealth/growth, fewer industries/technologies/jobs, greater debt https://t.co/csb0fETupZ
1) Krugman: Trade too complicated for peons to grasp. Rules, supply chains, globalization, etc. Only he can guide us https://t.co/csb0fETupZ
Krugman: "International trade is governed by rules...If we break, others will." Premise shaky, others never complied https://t.co/csb0fETupZ

Politico's Navarro hit piece: Lots on his five losing pol campaigns, no analysis of why his positions on trade wrong https://t.co/bTbIsWF0Sv
Experts in Fgn Policy piece=sensitive to China, Navarro presumed not. Their strategy to counter military buildup fed by trade cheating??
Snobbery: Navarro no China expert, unqualified on trade cheating/military buildup, no need to discuss his analysis. https://t.co/cjxpQlX5yW
Another hit piece: Navarro not Chinese speaker/member of 'China Experts Club' so his econ/military  analysis=wrong. https://t.co/cjxpQlX5yW
2) NYT: Harvard economist gives away the game: Economists in cabinet should protect peers/theories, not discover why free-trade not working
1) NYT: Economist reveals agenda-Important for CEA to protect academic integrity (i.e., flawed models) not business. https://t.co/ICcWMXwcxh
Ex ambassadors &amp; fgn relations experts condemn DC hysteria (Dems + MSM) abt Russia/Trump as harmful to US diplomacy. https://t.co/5JkjgvYRgV
Mankiw, as CEA head, said outsourcing probably good for US economy. Economist joke: 'Reality is interesting but does it work in theory?'
Mankiw: Trump must consult economists, so they can handcuff him, stop decisive action on behalf of working people. https://t.co/QZY8Zsipm4
Roach uses old trick - trade deficit is caused by savings deficit. NO causal connection, but an accounting identity. https://t.co/WTG1dvxKwU
6) If Cohn, Wall St, economists win WH 'trade war' &amp; oust Navarro, status quo of trade deficits/debt = unchanged; Trump presidency destroyed
5) FT quotes fgn govt officials saying Trump trade policy 'normalizing' w/ sidelining of Navarro. Of course, they want more trade surpluses
4) Of course economists hate Navarro. He rejects their tidy academic club &amp; false models that have decimated manufacturing &amp; working people
3) Economists criticize Navarro b/c they think trade deficits irrelevant &amp; believe in their faulty theories/models over blue collar reality
2) Cohn seized on Navarro’s stands on trade and currency cheating, which brought widespread criticism by economists, to sideline him.
1) FT: Trump trade war erupts - but among White House staff. Cohn seizes on Navarro statements to marginalize him. https://t.co/nBlQLh1ImJ
3) Holtz-Eakin and Furman presided over massive trade deficits &amp; are living proof that US economy is too impt to be left to economists.
2) Holtz/Furman discuss pinheaded econ theory abt deficits, miss big picture of low growth/failing industries/lost jobs/human devastation.
1) Holtz-Eakin &amp; Furman, economists w/ Bush &amp; Obama, knock Navarro's contention that trade deficits matter &amp; should be eliminated.
Jan trade deficit spikes despite exports. Autos/parts &amp; overall imports all-time record. Deficits=drag on GDP growth https://t.co/NzxHuAvy2D

2) Germany's undervalued mark was US target at Smithsonian and Plaza Accords. Back at it w/ Euro. Defense free-riding also frees up capital.
1) Germany has massive trade surpluses, takes no action to correct imbalances, blames currency undervaluation on ECB https://t.co/FMtptuul1n
3) New NAFTA goals: Tough enforceable sanctions for currency manipulation, including devaluation, FX mkt intervention, talking down currency
2) New NAFTA goals: Mex/Can drop VAT on US goods/services in exc for no US BAT on their g/s, tougher labor/enviro laws to raise wages/costs.
1) New NAFTA goals: 90% N. Am content, no goods transshipped thru Mex to US, Mex hikes exports to 45 FTA partners. https://t.co/GnCa2id3r6

@joemsnbc goes at Trump's $54B defense hike, asking is he now seeking war/against whom. Sometimes war finds you: Iran, NKorea, S&amp;E China Sea
MSM/left activists whip up hatred of Pres Trump &amp; family, then run stories about expense of Secret Service  protection for kids. Causation??
3) Purpose behind fake analysis on robots: stop Trump from negotiating new trade agreements, forcing global supply chains to locate in US.
2) Conventional wisdom on robots wrong. # of US jobs not fixed. Technology always changing existing work, but creating new industries/jobs.
1) The new conventional wisdom: Robots taking most jobs, no work for people. Thus no point in changing trade policy to bring jobs back home.
NYTUpshot: Labor mkt so tight, growth above 2% risks inflation. But robots replacing workers, no? Big surplus.Truth? https://t.co/XxpFTi1qXk
2) NAFTA sold as means to build Mex econ via exports to world (not US) so no more fin crises &amp; give jobs to all Mex workers in new economy
1) NYT Porter: NAFTA designed to let Mex weather repeated financial crises and to have US absorb idle Mex workers. Wrong on both claims!

3) But new Wall will stop many other drugs/contraband/criminals/terrorists coming across border - along w/ expensive, welfare-using illegals
2) Also new Wall will upset Mex elite, who will then be distracted and not concentrate on fixing own broken country.

Key to Abe visit: Japan slipstreaming unnoticed behind China b/c C's trade surplus larger. But Japan uses all the same trade cheating tricks
Abe: 5 pt plan to invest in US=just another scheme. J invested $B post-Reagan auto VRAs. Result: massive mkt share transfer from US to J cos

Border adjustable tax: If it impacts your wallet, b/c you buy fgn cars or appliances, you can minimize/escape the tax by buying US products.
US tried for decades to counter rising fgn border taxes w/o success. DISC, FSC, ETI all found trade-illegal. If Brady plan WTO illegal, quit

@POTUS delivered down payment on halting currency manipulation by killing TPP. Must continue in meeting w/ PM Abe. #stopcurrencycheating
Since ‘91, Japan directly intervened in currency markets 376 times to manipulate currency, subsidize exports. #stopcurrencycheating
@POTUS must address #1 trade issue facing American manufacturers and workers in meeting PM Abe: currency manipulation. #stopcurrencycheating
PM Abe visit: No need for Pres Trump to resurrect TPP w/ Japan only or rush into bilateral trade deal. More time necess to clarify US goals.
PM Abe's WH visit designed to obfuscate currency manipulation/mercantilism/closed market/defense free-riding by offering investment in US.
Japan's Abe visiting DJT Fri w/ five point plan to 'help' US. Real plan designed to keep US $ flowing to Japan ($68.9B deficit in 2016).
4) Incredible Summers so wrong for so long talking theory. Solution to $800B trade deficits/industry-job loss? Worker assistance! Really?
3) Summers=globlist w/o knowledge of intl business, FTAs, outsourcing, currency manipu, non-tarrif barriers, forced tech transfer, subsidies
2) Summers: US can't wall off products/people, must allow other countries to grow-at our expense. Everything ok if we aid displaced workers.

Japan investment in US after Reagan's VRAs lead to greater mkt share here.  Abe pledge likely to have same effect, lock in trade surplus.

Japan trade surplus w/ US stretches back 50+ yrs, $69B in 2015, sold US $50B autos/parts, 1.6M vehicles. US sold 19k autos. Abe will explain

@ElliottSDSU US became great econ power w/ tariffs via Hamilton's system, reality not study. Good recent work debunks free trade. Agn U know
Border tax will shift more economic activity back to US. Int'l supply chains become domestic. Less offshoring. More jobs/higher wages here.
@ElliottSDSU Free trade=a theory, assumptions aren't reality: Examples-stable FX rates/full employ/mobile labor/etc. U know but disregard.
3) US mark-ups/add-ons to wholesale price at border add significantly to final price and not subject to border tax.
2) Hysterics claim 20% increase in retail prices of imported finished goods. Wrong. Retail includes US transport/space/workers/benefits/etc
1) Superior analysis. Potential 20% border tax not added to current retail prices, but to wholesale price at border. https://t.co/yWqT99Clpl
@ElliottSDSU The WTO cares?? So you are shilling for fgn gov'ts and outsourcing MNCs. BAT shifts supply chains back to US, jobs/higher wages
Import tax: boon for producers, negative for consumers. Maybe, but producers give jobs so people can be consumers. https://t.co/47wWtTssLS
Import tax: only imposed on wholesale price at border, so no 20% jump in final price to consumers, per hysterics. https://t.co/47wWtTssLS
@judahariel @DanRDimicco Read Ryan-Brady tax blueprint to start. Not a Trump plan/inchoate/legislation not drafted. Might inform ur comments
@judahariel @DanRDimicco If u knew hist, then no Q. 60+ yrs, all Pres/Congress avoid VAT, use workarounds b/c can't pass VAT. Nor can Trump.
@ElliottSDSU VATs raise $ from fgn producers/dom consumers, they're tariffs. So? Only economists care. Big point is equality for US goods.
ATTN trade-deficits-don't-matter-globalists: US Q4 GDP growth 1.9%. Trade deficit subtracted 1.7% in Q4. 2016 US GDP growth pathetic 1.6%.
@judahariel @DanRDimicco Why don't you publish history of VAT, starting with 1940s GATT talks thru US FSC/ETI at WTO, then ask Trump not me.
@judahariel @DanRDimicco GOP border tax plan like a VAT. Same principle: tax applied where goods consumed not produced. Trump has now agreed
@Vladimirth @DanRDimicco @SteveForbesCEO VATs 'WTO legal,' no basis to complain. Quicker/more sensible to adopt VAT-like GOP plan Needed now
@DanRDimicco VATs began w/ France in 1954. Grew w/ tariff cuts to offset effects. Massive barrier to US exports. Agreed:past time to counter
@Vladimirth @DanRDimicco @SteveForbesCEO US tried for yrs to stop VAT expansion/rate hikes. Unsuccessful. What's basis for optimism at WTO?
@ElliottSDSU House GOP border tax mimics VAT re imports &amp; exports, not a tariff but response to fgn VATs. Same principle: tax where consumed
If border-adjustable tax on all imports to US-including Mexico's-is horrible, why not for Mexico w/ its 16% VAT, &amp; 160 others that do same?
Much negative media on POTUS remark 20% border-adjust tax is way to have Mex pay for Wall; but 0 mention Mex now puts 16% VAT on US exports
WSJ piece: US adopting border-adjustable tax may cause other countries to retaliate. ? 160 already have border VATs. https://t.co/b1WUhwgftR
3) WaPo experts cite "trade deficits" they run w/ local stores to show deficits don't matter. Completely FAKE ANALOGY by blind free traders.
2) WaPo blog neglects that NAFTA supposed to marry US technology w/ cheap Mex labor, so Mex served as export platform to the world, not US.
1) Another obscurantist WaPo blog says trade deficits don't matter. No, they must be financed, represent lost jobs. https://t.co/jQG4BxrWRU
3) Trump spox Spicer: 160 trading partners use border taxes to disadvantage US goods in trade. House GOP border tax plan = smart response.
2) Trump: House GOP border-adjustable tax plan "too complicated" But endorsed today at Repub retreat. Forces Mex to pay for Wall indirectly.
1) Trump policy switch: at Repub retreat applauds House GOP plan to tax imports/exempt exports as revenue-maker so Mex indirectly funds wall
2) WaPo:The Wall is mostly built but doesn't stop illegal crossings, same will be true of Trump addition.So why the hysteria/racism charges?

2) Elites as delusional: TPP will improve labor/environmental standards. Cheating hard to catch. Provisions not easily enforceable.
1) Elites think Trump's killing TPP=win for China. Even pro-TPP econ studies say only 0.04% US GDP growth due to TPP https://t.co/j6IHvM78Dk
2) Goods trade deficit $800B = 3.6M manufact jobs. If trade balance goes to $0, those jobs return. Even if 1/2 go to robots, still 1.8M jobs
1) Meme: US can't have manufacturing jobs b/c robotics=fake analysis. Co's like Carrier, GM offshoring for cheaper people, not cheaper bots.

Before agreeing to new trade deals (e.g., with the UK) or renegotiating NAFTA, Trump team needs to formulate trade objectives in depth.
There is an old military saying that the Trump WH should keep in mind as it rushes to fulfill promises: You want it bad, you get it bad.
Poor advance work (CIA visit), poor advice (argument on crowd size) hurt new president on first day in office.
6) As all other ideological free traders, Samuelson offers NO real time solutions to trade/budget deficits. Same course = eventual crash.
5) Samuelson: if US fails to provide free defense/wealth transfer via stupid trade, allies will go to Russia/China. Econ &amp; political models!
4) Samuelson:  2008-09 fin crisis had no fgn roots. Wrong. Housing bubble product of trade deficit $s pumped back into US chasing hi returns
3) Samuelson: Chicago murders not result of Chinese imports. Ok, but Chinese/others unfair trade cost Chi lots of industry/jobs=more poverty
2) Samuelson: Given Trump's economic nationalism, other countries will rush to protect their home markets.  Causation is backwards!

3) Given May's Davos speech, real mistake to rush into free trade deal with UK, which may become pass-thru for trade cheater goods to US
2) PM May silent on who is undermining trading sys. Implication:  @realDonaldTrump trying to restore balance, not trade cheaters like China.

@realDonaldTrump cannot keep promises on jobs w/o returning to US manufacture of parts/components/subassemblies as well as finished goods.

(1) Mass. Bay Trans Auth gives $280 M no-bid rail car contract to Chinese co. at secret meeting. States need to enact Buy US legislation.
(6) US negotiated for yrs to address VAT systems of trading partners. No success. With W&amp;M Chair plan, advantage of VATs will be offset
(5) VATs have risen every time US has gotten foreign competitors to agree to tariff cuts. VAT increase neutralizes tariff cut. #VATshellgame
(4) VAT rebates are used to subsidize foreign exports aimed at US market &amp; add to cost of US exports entering foreign countries.
(3) Fgn VATs have been accelerating problem since France introduced 1st one in 1954. VATs since expanded to 160 countries, rates skyrocketed
(2) Finally! A W&amp;M Chair gets the VAT problem: border taxes are used by fgn competitors to build their domestic industries, harm US exports.

2-Myth of 95%: people with no disposable income=not consumers in US sense. BUT they are cheap labor/offshoring workers for multinationals

4-Summers/others frantic about Trump trade plans but global trade is badly unbalanced Restoring balance = pain but better than global crash
3-Summers: Trump econ/trade plans no good. CBO: US budget deficit=sharp rise thru 2020. Goods trade deficit=$800 B. Let's not try new plan
2- Summers doesn't mention failed Obama plans to double US exports/create 1 M new manufacturing jobs.  Export increase was 52%, m. jobs 400k
1 - Larry Summers who piled up massive trade deficits as Clinton/Obama econ official badmouths Trump's trade plans on Bloomberg TV this AM
3-When 70,000 factories/5 M manufacturing jobs disappear, displaced  owners/workers are poorer, no discretionary income to save = ^deficit
2-Real Question is why don't we save enough? Answer is complex, but loss of manufacturing to fgn trade cheaters = much less wealth to save.
1-Globalist argue: US trade deficit caused by Americans' not saving but savings deficit=trade deficit in nat'l income acc'nting No causation
Roach blames US, says we cause our trade deficit bc we don't save. Wrong! Savings/trade deficits=accounting identity. No causation involved. https://t.co/GsvSY7jQUg

2 - Solution to China's military expansion: trash Trump warnings, hype trade war, don't alter US trade policy, send $300+ B yearly to China
1- China sends massive air armada over Miyako Strait into W. Pacific. Legal but provocative military move. Startled Japan scrambles fighters
Apprentice/'education' programs pretend to treat symptoms of free trade failure, but don't stop foreign govt cheating, don't create new jobs
More govt money to displaced workers makes liberal economists feel better about adherence to faulty trade theory but creates no new jobs
Instead of stopping foreign trade cheating Blinder in WSJ oped wants to treat symptoms with govt programs=no new jobs but cheating continues
Alan Blinder doesn't know history.  Suggests using Hamilton's system from 1790's. System used tariffs to grow economy, as Trump wants to do.
Economist Blinder WSJ oped: Contra Trump, we must follow Am. system started in 1790s. But Hamilton's sys used tariffs to protect US economy
Blinder makes up slogan 'Back to the 1950s' in WSJ op-ed, implies it's Trump's. New smear to fit lefty narrative No editors at WSJ either!

US mfg jobs, Jan 2015 = 12,318,000. US mfg jobs, Nov 2015 = 12,318,000.  Zero growth in 2015. Trade deficit with China rising at same time.

U.S. manufacturing added 4,000 jobs last month.  We need to be adding a lot more to grow our middle class.  http://t.co/AoYqvTYBAV
Another $30 billion monthly U.S. trade deficit with China. On track for a new record goods deficit w/China in 2015? https://t.co/PljvIuun5M

Hey, @BarackObama. Sorry, China does write the rules — despite your very earnest TPP slogans.http://t.co/wMRLxfCtZL
Canada opposition leader Mulcair demanding dairy &amp; poultry protection in TPP talks. Why can't U.S. stand up for its producers and workers?

Congress heads off for a holiday after passing fast track.  This clears the way for a very flawed TPP trade deal.  http://t.co/wMRLxfCtZL

Obama and House Repubs say TPP cuts tariffs on US exports. But TPP countries place high VAT taxes on US products.  http://t.co/dl7EKwczxX
Thanks to @edshow for the important discussion last night regarding the flawed TPP trade deal. https://t.co/nCD8SZSodI
Let's use the legend: "TPP, some deal for America!"  http://t.co/dl7EKwczxX
@johnBoehner got an 'I Rode on Air Force One Certificate.' He can frame it next to his 'TPP Death Certificate for the U.S. Economy.'
Many Members of Congress don't understand the predatory practices of our trade partners.  My interview with @edshow  http://t.co/JY0dHn6NvM
My interview with @edshow this morning, explaining why Congress just doesn't understand trade, and a flawed TPP.  http://t.co/JY0dHn6NvM
Here's a list of phony arguments being used to sell the #tpp.  http://t.co/cGU51lFuVl
TPA does not put Congress in 'driver's seat.' The TPP is largely finished.  Any negotiating objective set by Congress are merely advisory.
If a free trade agreement 'automatically' results in a surplus, why do we have a large, growing trade deficit with Korea? @StopFastTrack
We do not have 'trade surpluses' with our 'free trade agreement partners.' We do not have a trade surplus with NAFTA.  No on #TPPfasttrack
80% of world lives on $10/day or less.  Not consumers in any sense that the American people would understand.  http://t.co/dl7EKwczxX
Another reason why Congress shouldn't rush into #tpp-- the deal doesn't address VAT taxes by U.S. trading partners.  http://t.co/dl7EKwczxX
Mitch McConnell calls today's #TPA vote "an important day for our country." Yes, it marks the fall of Congress to foreign and MNC interests.
Domestic manufacturers have sent a clear message: No to #TPA and NO to #TPP .  http://t.co/hFnEK7KY4H
@RepPaulRyan Lyin' Paul Ryan again says 95% of consumers live outside US, but 80% live on $10 a day or less. What US products will they buy?
@RepBoustany-- I don't want the administration to negotiate without robust Congressional input. That's how TPP got 95 % finished.
@MikeKellyPA  TPA is the only way to get strong trade agreements. How about regular order in the House?
MI Rep Candice Miller had a big drink of free trade kool-aid. Says TPA has effective currency manipulation provisions. Delusional. #TPP
Tx Rep. Mike Conway thinks TPP will expand American agricultural exports. But USDA 2012 study finds no net gain for US ag under TPP.
Stand with Ohio #MarcyKaptur now on the House floor: "No more taking it out of the hide of American workers." Vote No on fast track.
Fast track trade bill doesn't address currency manipulation or anti-competitive Value-Added Tax of trading partners. It must be rejected.
How many GOP Reps are trading votes on fast track for false or unenforceable promises and ‘political goody bags?’  http://t.co/wMRLxfCtZL
House Republican leadership allows only one hour of debate on ‘biggest trade deal ever” Democracy at work? Hardly!  http://t.co/9vJejmSHHO
Trade Adjustment Assistance job retraining program #taa opposed by both Heritage Action and AFL-CIO. GOP Reps of all stripes should Vote NO!

Despite MNC pressure, Pres skips big Fast Track promo in SOTU. Does he meet Repub demand for heavy involvement? No! Floor time? Not likely!
RT @USBIC1: During SOTU, POTUS barely mentions Fast Track/TPP trade deal. Minimal promo by POTUS. CC: @KevinLKearns @AlanTonelson
Fed implicitly confirms no 'manufacturing renaissance' by continuing w/ $85 B mo bond buying and lowered economic growth forecasts.
Why is Obama putting 2,500 Marines in Australia but not confronting Chinese currency cheating? We pay twice, with factories/jobs and taxes.
The deficit reduction commissions are reporting, but where are the wealth-creation commissions so we can produce our way out of this mess?
