@clevelandrager @realDonaldTrump Thank you very much I appreciate it get in line with everyone else and by the way punctuations take up too much Twitter feed haha
I never realized how bad the left wants to nitpick at every little thing on a thread even punctuations LOL that just goes to show they have nothing better to do than to sit home in their parents basement playing on a device or computer twittering their life away
@clevelandrager @realDonaldTrump Advanced kindergarten I'm still playing with square pegs and building blocks sucking my thumb at the same time while taking a nap get over it find something better to complain about
@jebrivers @realDonaldTrump I must have struck a snowflake nerve I apologize in advance
@clevelandrager @realDonaldTrump Sorry sweet pea I don't let small things like that Disturbed me you get my point... punctuations are overrated
@jebrivers @realDonaldTrump And sorry to burst your bubble it's been quite some time and still there has been no crime committed and just for your understanding if you're referring to collusion it is not a crime and where is the evidence or the leaks that is the basis when you know something is tangible
@jebrivers @realDonaldTrump It's not even like a professional organization the media takes it and turns it it to tabloid and fictional comedy I live in the US where we have freedom of speech and freedom of press with no regulations however there is a line to be drawn when it becomes full-blown humility
