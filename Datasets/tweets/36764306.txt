15 All politics is local, as the saying goes. Esp for someone like @lisamurkowski who doesn't have her scope trained on being in the White House (hello Sarah Palin of yesteryear) + already well positioned as Energy Cmte chair to do work she finds valuable. No election til 2022.
14 @lisamurkowski: "This hasn't been fair to the judge..." BUT ALSO: "we need to have institutions that are viewed as fair and if people who are victims, people who feel that there is no fairness in our system of gov...we've gone down a path that is not good and right..."
13 @lisamurkowski says "I believe that Brett Kavanaugh is a good man. I believe he is a good man. It just may be that in my view he's not the right man for the court at this time." Via @eliseviebeck
12 Murkowski describes to reporters how tough her "no" vote was, saying "This has truly been the most difficult evaluation, decision that I've ever had to make" 	Tweet from @eliseviebeck: https://t.co/PB24blO8Sz
11 As chair of Energy Cmte, and as someone willing to bargain, Sen Murkowski has brought home wins important to Alaska Republicans during Trump Presidency. Opening #ANWR (a decades-long goal), loosening land restrictions and regulations.
10 Murkowski is known for her own measured temperament and for thinking before she speaks (sometimes to the frustration of reporters - and probably fellow GOPers - who JUST WANT TO KNOW HER PLANS. Ha.) Contrast that with the perception that Kavanaugh lost self-control last week.
9 Murkowski was personally lobbied - and spoke with - scores of #Alaska women against Kavanaugh here in DC on @ACLU sponsored travel. They're tweeting about what it meant for them to meet with her, and really feel heard. https://t.co/AcxyJ1Va9r
8 Sen Murkowski is aware of the optics of "old white men" pushing forward without a more fulsome FBI investigation, as @elainaplott tweeted this morning: https://t.co/uLisUYsLMT
7 Murkowski has been public about her disappointment in some of President Trump's behavior and comments over the years re: women, etc. After Mr Trump mocked Christine Blasey Ford this week at a rally, Murkowski said "I am taking everything into account." https://t.co/z7tvZ4BUAN

#Alaska org @NativeFed against #Kavanaugh, concerned he won't recognize AK Native rights. He wrote a 1999 @WSJ op-ed questioning whether Native Hawaiians are "Indians" under Constitution. That could lead to losses of rights. More by @lruskin + @kcgrove https://t.co/XfmT2Q4ATT 5
Sen Murkowski is loyal - both politically and earnestly - to Alaska Native supporters for many reasons, including their role in 2010 write-in race. Major AK Native organization @NativeFed opposed Kavanaugh, even before sexual assault allegations... 4
Since then Murkowski handily won her 2016 election, including with mainstream GOP voters, and isn't up for reelection until 2022. That's a long runway. 3
In 2010 Murkowski won a WRITE-IN CAMPAIGN (you try remembering how to spell M-U-R-K-O-W-S-K-I) against a right wing Republican who had primaried her. He had GOP $$ and establishment support (including in Senate) as the primary winner. She won.  2
LET'S TALK about @lisamurkowski and her NO proceedural vote on #Kavanaugh. I look forward to hearing more from the Senator in her own words. In the meantime, some thoughts. She is a Republican, make no mistake. But she's also a Republican not beholden to Party. 1

"This country's being ripped apart here." Sen @JeffFlake says senate needs to do due diligence. "I think that we can have a short pause, so FBI can investigate." Calls for it to be short and limited in scope, and hopes that Dems agree.
Sen @JeffFlake says he wants a week's delay to "allow the FBI to do an investigation limited in time and scope." With that hope, he voted to get Kavanaugh through committee. THE NEXT QUESTION: Will Leader McConnell actually delay a floor vote? TBD.
Kavanaugh's name will now go to the full senate. Senator Flake voted to move it out of committee, giving GOP the votes they need. BUT Flake has asked for a week's delay on the floor.

Woah: Dr. Ford had a reporter show up to her graduate classroom. She thought it was a student. Then the reporter came up to ask her a question. Also reporters coming to her home, and realizing her address was known, made her come forward to tell her story publicly.
Totally predictable: Chair Grassley cuts off "Ms. Rachel," Rachel Mitchell, the GOP questioner, in the middle of a line of Q's because 5 minutes is up. The structure of hearing is 5 min for GOP, 5 min for Dems. That means Mitchell's line of Q will keep abruptly stopping.
Prosecutor Rachel Mitchell, asking Q for Republicans, says in her first moments with Christine Blasey Ford of her feeling terrified: "That's not right." And "I just wanted to let you know, I'm very sorry."
Ford: "I believed he was going to rape me. I tried to yell for help. When I did, Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from screaming. This was what terrified me the most... It was hard for me to breathe, and I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me."

1 take-away from the #PA #grandjuryreport: survivors said they felt empowered to come forward after @BostonGlobe reporting on Catholic Church sex abuse and cover up. They realized they were not alone. We'll talk about it today with @PostBaron 2:45pm ET: https://t.co/jNFXxtPSqR
Today I'll interview @washingtonpost religion reporter @mboorstein about the #grandjuryreport and our executive editor @PostBaron about @BostonGlobe's groundbreaking reporting on Catholic Church sex abuse 16 years ago. at 2:45pm ET on @Twitch - https://t.co/JpsdzdyrZX
10 years ago, I visited St. Michael in western #Alaska and met a survivor, who shared his story. I filed this report for @NPR: "Fairbanks Diocese Copes with Sex-Abuse Crisis" https://t.co/Y0hwLCwwZn
In some villages such as St. Michael, virtually an entire generation of children were raped and abused by Catholic priests and workers. Attorneys for survivors allege that the Church sent "troubled priests" to "far flung" Alaska, where they were out of sight, out of mind (thread)
As my friend + former colleague at @KUACFMTV, @dlbross wrote, it's "sadly familiar to what happened in #Alaska." But there, back in the 1960s + 70s, priests + church workers were often the only white authority figure in Alaska Native villages - and seen as close to God. (thread)
A good friend I grew up with wrote to me, stunned and bewildered by news that one of his Catholic school teachers is named as an abuser of teenage girls. That priest is now dead. The survivors live with what he did.
When I got the #Pennsylvania #grandjuryreport on Catholic priests accused of abusing more than 1,000 children, I flipped right to the section on my hometown, #Allentown #PA. The Monsignor at my childhood church, beloved by many, is accused of covering up sexual abuse.
