Tax season wake up. Honey it's 8 a.m. Did you have appointments today? Me (in slight panic) It's Sunday isn't it?	Thankfully I was right.
@andreacpa0 I'm in. Betcha we can even find a place where our phones won't ring! Remote location =no work!
@ShaunHunley Don't keep sugary snacks in my office. And avoid the break room like the plague 😂
@taxchic_k I forgot to stop at the store for wine 😫
RT @guypbenson: Fair share https://t.co/9IjJC9akhR
@EmDeeEm @andreacpa0 Yes. It was paid to a corporation ;)
@MeganTarnow Who the heck cares? Like seriously....
@taxchic_k I. Have. no. words.
@taxgirl Ditto. Its all so complicated this year!
@nittiaj Ps other gem is accrual to cash conversion under $25M
@nittiaj I've been saying this for a long time now. And while for some tracking inventory does provide better information, many small companies struggle to track well and timely. Maybe following cash flow makes sense for them?
@cbriancpa @MelindaNCPA Review notes always. Because if I have to see your errors so do you. Nobody wants to take time to fix/address something that someone else will handle for them.
@taxbuzzonline If you have a PhD and your husband has an MD, it's very likely that you can afford a good CPA, and that person can help you with taxes (their profession), just like a CPA would go to a doctor for a medical issue. Be good at your profession, and let others be good at theirs!
@JoyceCPALLC I shall never hold an opinion again!
@justinmilleresq But my taxes are simple. I won't even itemize this year, right? Hello Iowa and ridiculously low standard deduction 😫
@joebwan That's social security for all. Your ssn for all highest paying criminals that is!
It's true! https://t.co/wMVVBRO237
@cbriancpa Agreed. This one did... And did it well!
Had a client that brought me coffee and filled out their organizer today. It doesn't get any better than that. #taxseasonwinning
@bstonercpa @CPANearMe Or filing glitches. Software is sooooooo not perfect this year!
@edzollars @MelindaNCPA @GlenBirnbaum @nittiaj That's what I kept thinking.
@edzollars @MelindaNCPA @GlenBirnbaum @nittiaj What if you own a c Corp that would be a part of a control group. C Corp not qualify so not sstb?
@taxchic_k Sounds awful. Including the cheap chocolate and beers.

@LaurenLoricchio All very true	But the problem I say to you	Is we expect them to do	When instead they just argue
@andreacpa0 So I have to say.... Your posts make me happy we have Ultra Tax.
@ShaynaCPA I don't, but if you have anyone with disabilities for clients that height is tough.

@taxchic_k Ha! We have a few clients that do. #spoiled
@cbriancpa @BrettNealCPA But during tax season studying requires wine at my casa, not pancakes ;)
@JWellsCFO HH ee, no, probably not, but security system....maybe? Are we talking rottweiler or toy poodle? ;)
@taxchic_k Not to mention the "postcard return" that took 2 pages and made it 6.😂
@taxchic_k Advising yes. Will most of them? Probably not - ha! We are having them sign statements regarding who is the ptrp rep for this year!
@taxgirl -6 and snow coming. Jealous of your sun!
@fintaxplanner @GlenBirnbaum I have similar scenario with 40% CCorp 60% S. And still rolling it in my head which way to go?
@GlenBirnbaum Agree. But that is only in final regs. So adjust for 2019, take QBI for 2018 anyway?
@paulkrugman @AOC https://t.co/bcWfnpLpfE
@nittiaj @Chris_J_Ballard @RaleighCutrer Crud. Was just re-vsiting this subject. Have an SSTB LLP owned 40% by a C-corp, 60% by an S corp. Then an LLC that rents to LLP owned 40% by C-corp owner individually, and 60% by S-corp owner individually. Now what? S corp owner is out. C corp owner?
@ShaunHunley Kinda have to this year don't we?
@taxgirl Or all of the Midwest....
@andreacpa0 I'm also really annoyed with the c corps aren't considered for commonly owned 162 RE businesses. Thinking some RE LLCs are going to contract their CCorp lessors for 250 hours of annual maintenance and record keeping.

@nittiaj Wait. What? This IS a big deal... Like particularly for this of us who are minority owners. Just saying!
@ryneb99 Once I had a halfway thru bombshell as well. But mine was the discovery of a 2nd baby. Now we tell our twins that 1 of them was planned 🤣
@RichardRubinDC @ForemanTaxLaw You know, the person that drives the trains.
There is a certain level of snow that makes me switch to driving highways like gravel roads. Found it tonight. #thisisiowa #iowagirl
@ShaunHunley I'm so angry at tax politics I could throw the whole Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018 at the next politician I see. Small taxpayers being run over like pawns these days!
@ShaunHunley But if you own a REIT, that qualifies.  What BS for the small guy. This is ridiculous!

@peterreillycpa @joebwan Carbs tax. Crap. No fatty proteins w/o tax, no carbs w/o tax. Ice cube diet?
@grantsfinancial @taxbuzzonline Ouch. We have qbi but waiting for state corp. software. Expected next week.
@andreacpa0 Sooooooo I kinda go with the if it doesn't matter accuracy doesn't matter approach in this regard. ballpark is good enough. 😉
@cbriancpa @BrettNealCPA For all .2% of our clients that applies to?
@taxbuzzonline A14 Use wisely, file F3115 timely! #taxbuzzchat
@taxbuzzonline A11 Small office work, cleaning, etc. as well as farm work for our farmers.  Re: that child wages only apply when not incorporated, though! #taxbuzzchat
@taxbuzzonline A9 Expense reimbursement all the way! #TaxBuzzChat
@taxbuzzonline A7 SEP or Solo-K sometimes work well. #itdepends #TaxBuzzChat
@taxbuzzonline Q8. Ummmm.....make sure it is 100% business use. Ha! #TaxBuzzChat
@taxbuzzonline A4. Already had plans in place. Reasonable comp. was a big issue before 199A. There's also a wealth of clients that reasonable comp. isn't an issue w/199A (&lt;wage limitation, SSTBs, or pay other EE wages) #TaxBuzzChat
@taxbuzzonline A3. Charitable contributions from IRA's, an every other year plan for charity, or a donor advised fund to lump charity. If under $10k state tax, pay up property taxes every other year to maximize. #TaxBuzzChat
@taxbuzzonline A2. And.....well making corporate structural decisions based on politics might be risky today! #TaxBuzzChat
@taxbuzzonline A2. This isn't a common recommendation for our clients. W/199A and double taxation + state tax for c-corps, the benefit isn't really there unless you expect to not do dividends in the near future. #TaxBuzzChat
@taxbuzzonline A1. QBI issues/unanswered questions, software delays, state issues, oh and IRS probs w/govt shutdown. #TaxBuzzChat
@JVATaxnLaw Except for this prop. is that they don't ask they just assume and sign you up. Then send a postcard (wasting postage $, paper, printing, handling) with prepaid postage so you can send back to opt out (more waste). Better solution: require yes/no checkbox in computer system. Done.
@cards_fan_66 @andreacpa0 Particularly April 2-15?

@andreacarrcpa Finding QB support to be less and less helpful lately. Ugh.

THANK YOU THANK YOU to @RepRodBlum &amp; @SteveKingIA for bringing legislation proposing to re-establish the 15% corp. tax bracket. Many small businesses here NEED this! @ChuckGrassley @SpeakerRyan #TaxReform
@peterreillycpa @andreacarrcpa @joebwan Lesser of 200k or taxable income (minus cap gains) ×20%...i think. Pre2018 deductions don't reduce QBI.
@iowahawkblog @RobProvince Dairy cows. All named with first initial same as mothers. Ah farm life!
@ShaynaCPA I've always wondered if pass rates have changed since then (data that I can find is scant). I was one of the lucky (sense the sarcasm) first few with the 150 hour requirement...

199A Proposed Regs: 184 pages of pure glory....+ 14 pages of guidance re: what W-2 wages are. #taxgeek
@willsherman90 @AnyMtn @worldsday @cdhthegreat @DallinBackstrom @SenSanders Well, they'll repay you for your health insurance cost, but first you have to pay the increase in taxes....because what's "free" has to be paid by someone....
@taxbuzzonline A11 Can I be in charge of spending, too? :) I like the response of @cbriancpa with an emphasis on revenue NEEDED. Spread burden on all with consideration of ability to pay in the equation, as well as leaving enough as an incentive to earn more for all.
@taxbuzzonline I don't think it will make a difference to local retailers directly. However, it will help more the rural communities, so indirectly, maybe?
@taxbuzzonline I truly hope not. I think if gov't spending is kept in check, it will all be ok. But....well, politicians!
@taxbuzzonline Yes I think there should be some (politicians can't be experts in everything), however I don't believe it should be a bloated  industry in and of itself.
@taxbuzzonline A6: For retirees, yes, some (but maybe it's that southern sunshine!). For others not really. I think job market and general cost of living holds  a higher role in the decision factor than tax does in most people's minds.
@taxbuzzonline A5: Yes, I do think everyone should have skin in the game. I'm not a fan of a tax policy that gives people larger "refunds" than what they have paid in. (i.e. EITC and refundable CTC)
@taxbuzzonline Hard question. Law is law. Save what you can, pay what you have to. In a more theoretical answer...fair is a bit relative. You can't expect the lowest earners to pay much, but you can't expect the highest earners to pay it all!
@taxbuzzonline A3: In moderation it doesn't bother me (cigarette tax - meh, whatever). But where do you draw the line: cake tax? Also think that it doesn't work on a local scale. People just go outside the city....
@taxbuzzonline A2 I don't see a reversal happening. Changes, yes, most likely!
@taxbuzzonline A1. Personally prefer a reasonable progressive. Consumption and flat are often hard on the poorest people, but I don't desire an extremely progressive tax, either.
@bethanyshondark As a parent of twins, using "they" all the time just reinforces that they don't have their own personalities and identities. This is a big enough problem (a chunk of our society does this already with multiples), without the intentional disregard for it! Poor kids....

@MattWalshBlog Crashing the car in a body of water with the kids. Choking. Kidnapping. Fire. The list continues...
@iowahawkblog You spelled Idaho wrong. Potato land right?
@joebwan And removal of Dpad in 2019 results in major tax increase for many as rates and qbi deduction don't get better until later...

@nittiaj Don't know, but considering the headache CPA's have with this....we should get a pity exemption!
@Dallas4Bernie @NancyPelosi There are multiple things that punish married couples in the current tax code......
@NancyPelosi Multiple items in today's tax code already punish married couples. What's new? (SSI, mortgage interest deduction limitations...)
@realDonaldTrump Would you please bring back 15% c Corp rate for c corps with under 50k income? This is a 33% tax increase for them!
@marcorubio I don't understand why the push for refundable CTC. It's already partially refundable? What's wrong with current plan?
@IvankaTrump I love small biz support via tax law. However, a topic being ignored: small c-corps that make $50k or less annually are facing a 33% tax increase. They NEED the 15% bracket!
@nittiaj Under this law, will it work like DPAD where 50% of qualifying wages can be used from any passthru entity?
@marcorubio We'd really love to see the 15% rate for the 1st $50k of income (that exists TODAY) #smallbiz needs this more than the 20% rate in general!
@marcorubio Um....essentially that happens. It's called the refundable child tax credit, and is applied based on earnings above $3000. And, it actually pays more than the employee's portion of payroll taxes.
@backyardprairie @ChuckGrassley Ok, so, seriously....if you're lucky, a family can save about $600 a year deducting student loan interest right now (many save less). Why are people so focused on this? Its removal is peanuts in the tax bill.
@NancyPelosi Just for the record....repealing the penalties for not having health insurance kicks no one off of health insurance? It just allows people to decide if they want or don't want insurance.....
@NancyPelosi Why's that exactly, Ms. Pelosi? Now that House has amended their bill to remove some of the SE tax implications, etc., it's actually looking like a pretty decent plan overall - especially for small biz. Senate's looks decent too.
@ChuckGrassley @SenJoniErnst @SpeakerRyan We need some revisions. This bill is hurting the smallest businesses! https://t.co/seAWhzImbc
@RepTerriSewell SALT for low income individuals doesn't matter -many don't itemize now, so no benefit, and the std deduction is increasing, so that helps many that do itemize at lower dollar values. Many on the upper end of middle class pay AMT, so have no SALT benefit currently, either. Next...
@davidaxelrod 33, firmly middle class income, not putting max into my 401k...yet. Increasing my % of pay each year, because I want to max out someday. Can't count on SS to be there for me and my spouse. $2400/year (proposed) isn't enough.
@lbrenshaw @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP Exactly how do you know this? There's not enough details yet...
@SenJoniErnst This is why you should speak with someone who really knows and understands the effects of tax reform on small biz!
@IDRTaxPros Welllllll unless it contains flour :) Twizzlers any one?
@ChuckGrassley But let's keep the estate tax, please. Better for the large majority of IOWA!
@SpeakerRyan Would really love some details as to income levels brackets would apply to. Come on!
@SpeakerRyan Is anyone going to share at what levels of income these tax brackets would apply to?
@ChuckGrassley This Iowa CPA likes many of the tax reform proposals....but we'd prefer to KEEP the estate tax and our step up in basis. It's best for most Iowans, farmers included!
@TomColeOK04 Would you please share at what levels of income you recommend these brackets to apply to? Hard to evaluate the effect when that's unknown!
@cathymcmorris @SpeakerRyan Are you saying no 8812, no 8867, no 2441? No 8949, no Sch B, etc.?
@SpeakerRyan Simply judging by the big six released.....No way postcard return will be happening for most taxpayers anytime soon. PS Most of America wants to keep estate tax AND our step up in basis. Please?
