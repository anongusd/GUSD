@PlutoWasRobbed 		If that was written after the debate, I want whatever they're on. :)
And with that, I'm out for the night!
Debate conclusion: Romney hit specifics &amp; gave great defense of free enterprise/limited government. Obama sounded tepid and not quite right.
RT @DavidSpady: After tonight's debate America now has hope for change #2012Debate #debate
Well, I guess Obama can't keep accusing Romney of not presenting specific policies. Now let's hear your plan, Mr. President #failingagenda
Can't blame Obama for sounding unprepared. Can't sound confident when you can only run on what you want to do or hope to do. #failingagenda
Great debate. Obama was "not very crisp" and Romney came out "aggressive" according to commentators. Sounds about right for me.
Romney's closing: Specific, using numbers on tax/healthcare/military, and surgical on Obama's record.
Obama's closing statement=the same non-specific platitudes he's given for 4 years. He must not realize he's the incumbent.		#failingagenda
@katyabram 		Herman Cain says Romney's been talking of undoing a lot of them with executive orders of his own
RT @kerpen: Give Obama this - he united every single member of Congress - IN OPPOSITION to his ZERO vote, never-balancing budget.
RT @FlakeforSenate: President Obama looks angry. Not used to being challenged like this. #azsen
@kerpen 		Totally unserious.
"We need to have leadership in Washington." Boy, do we! #failingagenda
Romney hits Obama again on the green energy boondoggle. Crony capitalism under Obama had cost taxpayers billions. #failingagenda

@secupp Wait, you mean it's not to make sure there's a chicken in every pot and a puppy in every kid's room??
Romney is really making a case for educational reform and school choice. Loving it! @slmbolick
The path we are taking is not working. #failingagenda
Romney: "Key to great schools is great teachers." Thank you! No evidence that more teachers (i.e. smaller class size) =student improvement.
HT @PlutoWasRobbed 		For all those claiming Romney isn't giving specifics, please tell me one thing Obama will do in second term.
RT @KarlRove: Obama running out of energy and pressure showing. Romney looks ready to pounce.
A defense of the 10th amendment and decisions being made at the state level! Whoo!! @MittRomney
Romney just gave one of the best defenses of the free market as the best way to lower the cost of a product I've seen in a long time.
HT to @Heritage for their REAL plan to reform healthcare! 		http://t.co/zLTAVTl4
So refreshing to see a candidate highlighting IPAB and the inherent rationing that will result from it. #DenverDebate #failingagenda
Romney is really hitting Obama on IPAB and healthcare. "Free ppl and free enterprise can bring down costs better than government."
20% of those under Obamacare will be forced off the coverage they like. FACT given to you by the super-conservative and pro-Romney CBO
Romney: "We didn't raise taxes. We didn't create IPAB. We didn't force ppl off the plan they want." That's the difference between OC and RC
Would be easier for ppl to pay more of their healthcare bills if they had jobs and the economy was growing. #failingagenda

@KarlRove don't confuse the President's supporters with logic, Mr. Rove
@JonahNRO yup...the emperor has no clothes.

Glad Mitt Romney remembered that Obama is cutting 700 billion out of Medicare to pay for his middle class healthcare entitlement.
Obama's policies on healthcare will somehow lower Medicare costs sometime in the future...or something. I dunno #DenverDebate
Social Security is structurally sound? Really, Mr. President??!

Romney hits Prez on his $90 billion in subsides to green energy. Money quote: "You don't pick winners and losers, you pick losers."
Mr. President: Wouldn't have to worry about companies getting tax breaks for going overseas if you stop driving them there #failingagenda
RT @PriscillaForbes: Obama: I've been trying. Romney: You've had four years! #DenverDebate
Romney makes the comparison to Spain on total spending on government. Excellent point!
Romney: "You've been prez for four years. You've found ways to cut trillions of dollars and yet we still have trillions in deficits." Boom!
Obama talking a lot about what he WILL do...sounds a lot like the same stuff he promised four years ago. #failingagenda
Obama has almost added more public debt than all former presidents in history. #denverdebate #failingagenda
Romney's test for a gov't program's survival: "Is it worth borrowing money from China?" Awesome!
Romney: "Problem with raising taxes is it slows growth." duh #denverdebate
Romney points out 23 million ppl are out of work after four years of President Obama's #failingagenda
No adding to the deficit...bring down rates but keep revenue in. Putting ppl back to work by taking gov't boot off their neck. Imagine that!
Romney: "No better way to balance a budget than getting ppl back to work, making more money, and creating more tax revenue." Right on!
RT @KatiePavlich: Romney smart to hit home the fact of small businesses paying the individual rate #debate
RT @secupp: Romney:"I've got 5 boys. I'm used to people saying the same thing over and over again hoping it becomes true."
RT @michellemalkin: Romney zings Obama for repeating lies hoping ppl will believe it. Says he has 5 boys. He's used to it. Laughter from ...
Obama: "I lowered taxes on sml biz 18 times." You also piled tons of regulations on them that prevent them from expanding. #failingagenda
Romney calling out Obama for misleading about his tax plan...repeating the same falsehoods won't distract from the Obama's #failingagenda
Obama cannot credibly talk about deficit reduction when he's given America nothing but trillion dollar deficits!
RT @raquellewis: #Obama wants to hire another 100,000 teachers!  Why don't we just make sure the ones we have can actually do a good job!
RT @nansen: America does best when the middle class does best? The middle class has been buried for the last 4 years! #CantAfford4More
Would like Obama to answer how he plans to reduce deficit AND spend more to "invest" in infrastructure and education, i.e. more gov't hires
Romney promises new energy jobs and pro-small business policies. Sounds good, but specifics please.
Obama stalls...finally says America does best when the middle class does well. Middle class has been buried under Obama! #failingagenda
