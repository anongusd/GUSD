@MarcoBogaers @DavidMoffett47 @hamishpricenz Nice one Hamish!		If you receive franking credits greater than the tax you owe on you‚Äôre taxable investment income the ATO sends you a cheque.		Pretty good eh!
@DavidMoffett47 @hamishpricenz You clearly want to shape public opinion by tweeting - why else do it?		Good on you - but do it responsibly!
@DavidMoffett47 @hamishpricenz Maybe you should read it. They are not proposing ending franking. They are planning to end refunding excess franking credits - that is very different.		For what it is worth I disagree with the proposal - it only further distorts the tax system and rationale allocations of capital
@DavidMoffett47 @hamishpricenz No need to be so snarky - I do follow the news and I do my own research, I just think it is only reasonable that if you are going to have such strong views on a range of issues you develop those positions based on facts.		I‚Äôll happily support you if you can prove your point.
