The “Big Tech” primary for Democrats is just a whole different potato this time around than it was in 2016. Back then the push was to show how well supported you were by Silicon Valley. Now — in the early going, at least — it’s to show how tough you can be on the tech industry.

@Nick_Zen @jackshafer It is complexificating for sure.
@Nick_Zen @jackshafer Conventions can be difficult to raise money for. What I’ve heard from people in the field is that unless donors can contribute at a high-level, they worry their contributions will go unnoticed and thus aren’t worth it. Then, of course, there’s the politics.
@ConnorsDoscs @jackshafer Google and Twitter the same, Facebook $1.45 million.
@Nick_Zen @jackshafer Total cost of the convention was a little over $60 million, and it wasn’t easy for the convention committee to raise that. So $2 million-ish is, you know, appreciated by organizers.
Digging into FEC reports for this story, was struck by how much big tech companies gave to the ’16 GOP convention: 		Facebook = $1 million	Google = $500,000	Twitter $250,000 		Small change for them, but decent chunk of the convention’s operating expenses. https://t.co/zr5GeFL4EQ

@Joenewsguy Ideally!
Sometimes reporters are legitimately just curious, like other humans.
For all of you following the ‘how did Rep. Ocasio-Cortez get @AOC, when it seems like all the good handles are taken?’:		Per Twitter, the account had been suspended for years and was released to her team upon request.
@NickPacilio @yashar @wexler @AOC Thanks!
@NickPacilio @yashar @wexler @AOC I did email you all on this. But can I get a short explanation here. Is it just that the account was suspended and once someone asked for it, it was given away?
@jslez @yashar @wexler @AOC Thanks again. One thing that caught my attention was that the account had been suspended for several years before it was reissued. I was surprised, without knowing much about it, that it wouldn't have already been released back into the wild before Ocasio-Cortez asked for it.
I’m picturing a Mark Warner step-in. https://t.co/XvbU6RO9lM
@jslez @yashar @wexler @AOC Thanks for this. These were accounts that weren't being used, had been suspended, some combination of those?
@wexler @AOC (Also I am here for “not very exciting.”)
@yashar @wexler @AOC So the thinking would be that it had been suspended (for years, it seems, per the Wayback Machine) and was released to her upon request?
@wexler @AOC And it was available?

@AdamKeiper @ZacharyGraves @DJLSmartData See, these things are complex. Assessment, as I think about it more, does seem to match the purpose of the role, at least as it was conceived.

@ZacharyGraves @DJLSmartData I’d devote at least 500 words to this topic in my piece.
For what it’s worth, I think the brand is some part of the appeal, at least in Washington. “OTA” is sorta, like, a shibboleth to a certain generation of folks. Though I guess keeping the acronym might be enough. https://t.co/ScYfjlwq6f

@danielschuman @ZacharyGraves Yeah, the Senate seems the challenge.
@mamaskullx3 @nigelcameron *Senator* Mitt.
@danielschuman It seems like a GAO OTA stands real chance of getting ignored. A House-only body seems, to me — who has thought about this again for about 15 seconds, for the first time in years — like a far stronger possibility and eventual entity.
It's quite an election year when a former Republican nominee for president can get elected to the Senate with hardly anyone noticing.
