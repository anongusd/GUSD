@TulsiGabbard Trump is already sandbagged away from foreign policy, but he just managed to slip in a warning about the danger of "WAR &amp; Investigation". His meaning is clear: Pence/Bolton/Pompeo are preparing WAR.  WAR: nobody's talking about it. Everybody's distracted by his personality. WAR.
@danibostick thank you for offering to do the Latin version, very innovative, I loved the artwork, from now on, of course, you must do it every year, a sine qua non!
@RoseAnnDeMoro Trump is obviously no saint. Lies, lies, lies. BUT: in the "special text" he warned of two dangers: WAR and investi.. bla bla.. listen to him on WAR: he knows that we're a single terror attack from plunging into a Trillion-$$$ WAR with IRAN whether Iran did it or not
@SenJeffMerkley Trump warned of 2 dangers to our properity: WAR and (investigations): forget those; his warning of WAR is to be taken seriously. We can't afford more trillion-$$$ wars but war w/ Iran is around the corner. Just one new terror attack, Iran is quickly blamed, we're at WAR
TWO THINGS: WAR and investigations...he's warning us of war plans in his cabinet: Pence/Bolton/Pompeo but no one's listening---	This is the darkest moment from Trump's State of the Union address https://t.co/yl3daCq64O via @MotherJones
@mtracey @medeabenjamin Donald Trump went out of his way, apparently in a special inserted text, that America must avoid any more trillion-dollar wars in the Middle East. The commentators are all flustered, cannot grasp it
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump he spoke truly when he said that one of the things which threatens our prosperity is the threat of a huge war, likely in the Middle East. He said we must avoid more trillion-dollar wars in the Middle East. Did Israel's ambassador walk out?
@danibostick Trump dicit: sunt pericula dua (II) maxima ante oculis nostris: bellum non necessarium (adfirmandum est! periculi de homunculo Pence orientis); et "pervestigationes"
@danibostick nunc loquitur de Persia; et de nave Cole; de periculo Parthorum; de superstitibus Holocausto
@danibostick dicit exercitum ex medio oriente trahendum esse (verum!)
@danibostick laudat dictatorem Brasiliae novem
@danibostick heu! nefas! facinorosus!
@danibostick verum est; horribile auditu
@danibostick ubi de rebus exteris loquitur? "Tehran delenda est!" Pence clamat?

@jennycohn1 @RealProgressUS @#RealProgressUS does look, I must say, to put it mildly, quite dispensable. It doesn't seem to contribute anything worth following, just noisy slogans.
@jennycohn1 I'll watch Bannon France &amp; Germ. more; I think Putin's support of Repubs was a one-off, Pence/Bolton/Pompeo are hardly in his interest; but Israel is now full-on Republican/Evangelical to the end of time &amp; they now have $Billions &amp; IT skill to do lots of election interfering
this Ron Paul tweet illustrates perfectly why any "Bannon scheme of "far left" + "far right" is a non-starter, even if both sides might agree on less / or / non-foreign intervention. Ron Paul / CatoInstitute still idolize $$ BILLIONAIRES with giant YACHTS https://t.co/Ijkr2YnzHh
@jennycohn1 you say you want to avoid divisions among Dems but how does pursuing this crap do any good? Aren't you off on a tangent? 2016 is done and gone. Focus on the next 20 months. Trump will be gone. Need to consider: what is needed to beat Pence/Haley?
@jennycohn1 IMO Dems need a male (sorry..!) in top spot; Kamala's a fighter but needs to pack more foreign policy saavy against Nikki; ticket something like @ChrisMurphyCT / @KamalaHarris. These aren't my policy choices, it's about electability
need a halt to the spreading, deep-pocketed $$$ pro-Israel McCarthyism. Much of the $$$ bribery to Congress is simply blowback from the ever-increasing $$ Billions our eager bribed Congress sends off to RightWing Israel each year -- it flows back as more bribes, a vicious spiral https://t.co/TwwcZJREF7

@bungarsargon Bravo for @SenGillibrand! she already showed awareness of the threat to our First Amendment earlier this year, she's now on my 2020 radar - in a positive sense! - along w/ @SenSanders &amp; @TulsiGabbard: Real Dems!
she certainly did, with help -- not from supine passive Repub.-lite Chuck Schumer, but from active, alert Sen. @ChrisVanHollen who recommended no Senate business unless to re-open gov't. He showed true Senate leadership and deserves to be new Senate Dem. Leader! https://t.co/s5cNeQPKx8
got in late to watch the Senate S.1 voting; "Dem" Senators Whitehouse &amp; Markey just voted "aye" for the anti-American bill in sync w/ TedCruz to establish a pro-Israel Inquisition and to funnel a new record $4 B/yr to Israel. Could better use that money in Flint or for healthcare
@KamalaHarris Oh happy day Dems make history again! But in Nov. 2020 Pence/Haley will make history with first woman VP, then they'll make history by abolishing Social Security &amp; Medicare &amp; packing the SCOTUS even more. Wow, lot's of history being made!
might as well abolish all US foreign aid: almost all of it now goes to wealthy Israel. Why? Careful here, it's now illegal to criticize the Israel Lobby. Why not #DefundIsrael it still can't stand on its own after 70 yrs &amp; we're still INCREASING our giveaways to it? - insanity https://t.co/kBpth0qYKS

gov't reopened due to air traffic controllers? -&gt; also at insistence of Israel Lobby to get this stinking "nonpartisan" S.1 bill passed w/o delay: nationwide US inquisition to suppress critics of Israel's apartheid; $4 BILLION/yr for 10 yrs record giveaway; war promise https://t.co/taHOtGw9t4

@elqulime so you're an Israel True Believer, Israel does no wrong, how sweet of you a true Candide! So why is AlQaida still active adjacent to the Golan? If Syria makes a move against them Syr is immediately hit by Israel. Israel's goal is to drag US into new $Trillion-$$ war against Iran
@ColeenRowley the pattern of real foreign/security policy being done in the VP office is of course repeated in the Bush Jr admin &amp; of course today with Pence being the man behind the curtains. It actually functions, the Dems haven't grasped it
@elqulime my impression was of various strands: Brett McGurk focused against ISIS but Israel/Pence nudged Bolton to barge in to target Iran; if you target Iran then ISIS is an ally; Israel &amp; its media have long rooted for ISIS/AlQaida against secular Syria
@kppotatoes simply screaming "impossible! never! AntiSemitism!" is no proof against the plausibility of it; Israel has benefited massively ever since from the ensuing eternal "War on Terror"; cannot be ruled out. The few US sec officers who sensed an Israeli hand would keep absolute silence
@elqulime little known fact remains, many Kurds (Sunnis) were/are as fundamentalist as Arab Sunnis, though not the majority of Kurds. The Kurds as a whole are a cynical pet project, turned on &amp; off by Israel/US, to pressure/split up the neighboring states.
@AmirAminiMD #Kamala plans to travel first-class on Israel's new Apartheid Highway with full Israel Lobby support onto the Dem ticket. Like Hillary, she'll make more "history!" But the Israel Lobby will push Pence/Haley over the top in November 2020 when it counts.
