Gun violence is an epidemic in America. Reducing gun violence to make communities safer is not a partisan issue, it’s an American issue. It’s time for change and the American people have had enough. Voting today for the Bipartisan Background Checks Act was the right thing to do.
February is Black History Month and we've been using this time to reflect on the contributions and sacrifices of African-Americans to our great nation. Let us always recognize the many African-Americans who have shown us time and time again what it truly means to be an American.
My colleagues and I voted today to terminate the President’s border emergency. I’m proud we acted quickly to protect the checks and balances in our constitution and prevent this undemocratic power grab.

The President’s proclamation today is a clear abuse of executive power. There is no real national emergency at our border and I find our president's actions very disappointing.
Tonight congress passed a bipartisan agreement to invest in border security where needed and keep gov’t open.	 	The agreement is not perfect but working together to come up with a bipartisan compromise that moves us forward is the leadership the American people need and deserve.

Our nation's #FoodPolicy should serve the widest range of Americans possible. It should not further divides us.

My #FarmBill amendment keeps "fresh" at the heart of our school's Fresh Fruit &amp; Veggie Program. Healthier foods=healthier kids.
#ReasonsWeNeedaFarmBill: CA grows 1/2 of US fruits &amp; veggies. Keeping these fresh foods in schools improves child health &amp; fights obesity.
#ReasonsWeNeedaFarmBill: Over 400 commodities come from CA, more than any other state.
