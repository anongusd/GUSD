Go load a car with home cooked meals and deliver them to families who are hungry and grateful that you showed up.
Go change the shoes of a child whose current pair have flapping soles, worn thin and weak by more than a thousand miles of putting one tired foot in front of the other. Look at the shoes and see them for what they are: holy objects  representing all the hope a human can muster.
Go to a bus station and watch weary parents hold it together through fear and uncertainty as they set off on yet another journey, usually with no money and no food.
The crisis at the border is NOT one of bad hombres and bad mujeres coming to steal your jobs, perpetrate crimes, or threaten your way of life. 		If you‚Äôre confused about that, go spend a night or two at the border.

A version of the same story repeated itself a couple days later, with a different family, in a different city. New Year‚Äôs Eve. The woman said her husband woke up depressed that morning, aware of the holiday, hoping 2019 would mark a turning round a dark corner into the light,
We asked the mom if she wanted to go grocery shopping, and she ended up filling a cart with the things that are impossible to pay for when you‚Äôre broke and not allowed to work: meat, eggs, cheese, milk, orange juice, yogurt.
One of the families we visited had literally nothing to eat but cheap sandwich bread and mayonnaise, but didn‚Äôt want to tell us. It‚Äôs a mom with two kids, and one of the kids has two serious health conditions.
Because it‚Äôs a point of cultural connection. And, of course, because he wants to know if a family needs food without asking them that.
and the experiences of spending time with them deepened our commitment to this work. 		When we visit or call a family, one of the questions Francisco always asks is what they‚Äôve been cooking or eating. He asks because it‚Äôs an ice breaker.

If you want to donate to his bond fund, please make a donation to our general fund and write "Tornillo teen" in the memo line. 		https://t.co/Ci3yZ72npJ
His bond has been set at $5,000, which seems to be the current going rate for freedom -- in my email and other messages right now, there are no fewer than five requests for bonds of this amount. I'm not stupid. I *know* we can't free everyone. But can we free him?
Can we show that there is a beloved community who will do what they can to lift him up? Maybe if you can't give (truly, even $1 makes a difference when multiplied by all of you), could you share with someone you haven't shared with before?
Many have been separated from their families either through the loss of a parent or abandonment. Would it be possible for your group to cover his bond?"		I know I ask so much of all of you every single day, but can we dig deep and give this kid a fighting chance?
The person asking us to pay his bond writes this: 		"His case highlights one of the many challenges we have faced in finding support for children who have been held in the Tornillo prison.
Just stop for 10 seconds to meditate on that. 		And then he made the perilous journey here. 		He got here and was put into Tornillo, the isolated tent city in Texas I visited a few weeks ago. And then he turned 18 and was whisked away to adult ICE detention.
We have multiple active bond requests at the moment. Each one has an agonizingly painful backstory. 		But this one... this one is for a young man who just turned 18. His father died; his mother abandoned him. For half of his short life, he has lived alone &amp; supported himself.

@BmfTaB It is. There‚Äôs no doubt about it.
11. And to say that's unfair is the grossest of understatements‚Äù.  ‚Äî- end of thread.
10. I don't know how to live with that other than to do what I'm doing, but as I sat with this child and her pain tonight, it felt so, so far from being remotely adequate. There is a fundamental piece of her that is broken.
9. This is the behavior of a five year old who has been irrevocably traumatized by my country's government and by "ordinary" citizens who are complicit with its policies.
8. but she didn't want to lie flat, and she came out of the room a few times to make sure I was still around. 		This is not normal five year old behavior.
7. I put her in our guest bed and tried to take her shoes off, and she sat bolt upright, refusing to let me remove her shoes. I asked if she wanted to take off her jeans and put on some pajamas -- no way. My daughter  climbed into the bed with her and she relaxed a bit,
6. I knew she was gripped by the terror that the separation that happened to them this summer was happening all over again, and I was devastated. 		She fell asleep as soon as I pulled up to our building, and I carried her gingerly, anxious to avoid waking her.
5. She beat the car windows, tried to open the door (thank goodness for child lock), and yelled at me, telling me that she hoped the police would stop me and take me away. 		She screamed all the way to my home, looking out the window, crying out for her mother.
4. telling her she needed to keep the belt on. As I shut the door to walk around to the driver's side, she started wailing, screaming for her mother, and telling me not to leave.
3. The ER was surprisingly full and feisty for a Tuesday night, and there were plenty of things going on that a five year old didn't need to see. 		I took the child's hand and we walked out to the car. I put her in the backseat and clipped her seatbelt,
2. I stayed at the hospital for about an hour, and the mom asked if I'd mind taking her daughter home with me, as we didn't know how long she'd have to wait, she herself was in agony and just wanted to sleep, and she was aware her daughter was also exhausted and cranky.
1. Sadly this is not an uncommon occurrence: ‚ÄúTonight, I went to go see a mom in the ER. I suspected she had her five year old daughter with her, and in addition to wanting to make sure the mom was ok, I wanted to make sure her daughter was, too.

They typically have only a a few dollars, if any.  It can take days for them to reach their destination.
When we can, we give them hot meals to start off their trips across the country. Included are over the counter pain relievers and meds for stomach conditions as well as diapers, water, sandwiches and snacks.
Our volunteers take backpacks filled to the bus stations for the refugees to help them on their journey. The families have NOTHING about the clothes on their backs usually. The busses are cold and they are hungry. https://t.co/2OUNdyUt0t

The family still has hurdles to clear before full reunification, but that moment of reunion was everything, and we can't do it without you and the largely invisible network of volunteers, people who show up when we call them at the last minute

After a few minutes, the mom introduced him to us and to the volunteer. She said, "These are the people who helped us get to you." Through his tears, he extended his hand to me, and I thought he just wanted to touch my hand or hold it, but he opened his hand.
The child took a few seconds to realize that his mom and grandmother were there, and to react, and when he did, he burst into tears and said, "Mam√°, Mam√°," and jumped on her, hugging her fiercely.
We met them at Cayuga to make sure that they would be allowed to see the child. Unexpectedly (because this was NOT protocol back in July), we were present at the moment that the family saw each other for the first time since they were separated.
The mom and grandma were brought halfway across the country to New York via car relay, as we've done so many times before, and they are being housed and fed by volunteers here.
and headed to Cayuga, where we were to meet a volunteer who picked up a mom and grandmother to bring them to an appointment to see their son/grandson, whom they had not seen in three months.

We are responsible for each other, we want these families here, and they are not alone.‚Äù  They witnessed and then they went and told others so that all of you can know what is going on in this country and have at least some small sense of how outrageous and horrible it is.
They translated and eased the shock of bad news. They accompanied women to appointments with ICE and third party monitors and said, ‚ÄúWe are here and we are watching and we aren‚Äôt going to tolerate abuse or nonsense. NOT ON OUR WATCH.
And really, these were just the most urgent situations this week. There were many others.  In every case, an incredible volunteer or whole team of them jumped into action and showed up. They were there. And even when that didn‚Äôt solve a problem, their presence made a difference.
When they got there, they ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt see‚Äù the doorbell and claimed to have called her (there are no incoming calls from the worker‚Äôs phone), so they logged her as not being home and compelled her to return to check-in (second time this week) today.
or would, if the batteries they gave her for the monitor worked. Guess whose fault it is if they don‚Äôt work?). Because she had to stay there, her child missed two important doctor appointments, one of which was a pre-surgical consult. And guess what?
One family is losing their home this weekend.  One mom was obligated to stay at her new home for three days, from 6AM-6PM, for a home visit that would confirm the place of residence. (Mind you, she has an ankle monitor, so they KNOW where she is at all times‚Äî
This week has been heavy.  So many of the moms have been sick and have needed to go to urgent care. One learned she has ulcers. One learned she has cancer. And the doctor who admitted her believes ICE may have deliberately delayed her care.

We are grateful for the opportunity to provide medical care and support to the children and for the incredible work of the volunteers at Immigrant Families Together."   We are so thankful to Dr. Cohen and his team for stepping in with this much-needed service.
says Tribeca Pediatrics executive director Leslie Pennypacker. ‚ÄúWorking with children everyday, the news of these children being separated from their families at the border had a profound effect on our team.

With the start of the new school year, and the physicals and vaccine requirements that come with it, the generosity of Tribeca Pediatrics comes at the perfect time.
Medical care has been one of our highest costs at IFT as children have been released from detention with a variety of untreated illnesses. A physical alone would run us $250 per child if paid out of pocket.
IFT is thrilled to announce that Tribeca Pediatrics, with 23 offices in New York City and one in Los Angeles, will provide free physicals to the children of recent detainees bonded out by Immigrant Families Together. https://t.co/QNGm9ufBd7

Finally, we are now working on a number of legislative initiatives.		Please help us meet our goal as soon as possible by donating to our $100,000 Match Campaign. https://t.co/bzMtrrP0sp
and, of course, so are the partnerships and pro bono services, such as those provided by Tribeca Pediatrics and .@miles4migrants
The needs are substantial and they aren't abating, so every donation to our general fund is enormously helpful (none of us draws a salary; literally every penny goes to the families)
and the Association for the Assistance of Refugees in Missouri. 		Our work now spans well over a dozen states, and we have received some celebrity and foundation support to continue and expand our efforts.
Every day brings opportunities to collaborate with other organizations and individuals doing this work, 		and we have provided cash and in-kind assistance of all types to the Angry Abuelas and T√≠as, Brethren, the South Texas Pro Bono Asylum Representation Project,
When they were willing to share contact information and destinations, we worked to get pro-bono medical services for them at their destination or en route, and have also ended up providing many of the same continuing care services and supports as the other families.
Our on-the-ground volunteers saw parents and children with dehydration, GI distress, colds and fevers, strep throat, and other illnesses or injuries, some of which were severe.
In addition, right around the July 26 reunification deadline, we began triaging families coming out of detention. 		They were streaming through Texas bus stations, most with only the clothes on their backs.
Many of the families here remain deeply stressed about the difficulties their families are going through at home, and feel pressured to send remittances to pay back debts and/or provide basic support to their families.
In many cases, this support ends up being cross-national in nature; the families here have left behind extended families and other children of their own, and often have done so leaving the families in debt or with other serious problems.
but often includes a pro bono legal referral (or low bono referral that we fund), 	medical and dental care, mental health and social work services, housing, getting kids enrolled in school, providing essentials, such as clothing and food, and community/social support.
That money has been used to bond out 27 women and 2 men from ICE detention facilities in five states, and then transport them to their families and provide ongoing support in the post-reunification process. That support takes varied forms based on each family's specific needs,
to pursue work authorization for at least five months, and if caught working under the table, put their claims for asylum or other legal relief at serious risk. 		In the two months since then, we have raised nearly 3/4 of a million dollars.
to be able to care for herself and her kids while she awaited immigration proceedings. 		As you can imagine, that is no small feat, not only because this is such an expensive city, but because the folks coming out of ICE detention are not allowed
In an interview with the station, Orochena said that Yeni could complete her immigration proceedings in New York and be with reunified with her kids		... she just needed to be able to post bond and get from Arizona, where she was in the Eloy Detention Center, to NYC, and,
What has become Immigrant Families Together started on June 25, 2018, when I launched the first GoFundMe campaign for Yeni, after hearing her lawyer, Jos√© Orochena, speak on our local NPR affiliate the week before.
WOO HOOO 	What an opportunity! 	An anonymous donor has pledged $100,000 if we can raise $100,000!

Decent, hardworking people who mean no harm are blamed for crime, unemployment, failing schools, and various other ills, and become in the eyes of many the objects of hate and fear."

What can people do to help? Call your electeds. It DOES work. Show up at marches.  Support the ACLU, the work of  organizations, there are many.
This will be a disgraceful chapter in history. This will be one of the darkest chapters in American history on American soil. 		Who else will get targeted? This is not over, It is about to get much, much worse.
The children have been traumatized by separation are traumatized for life, especially the younger children. They do not understand why they were separated from their parents or why their parents left them.
"What I saw I will NEVER forget. The guards are overwhelmed. 	 It was sickening and inhuman to watch this occurring in our country. "  - Jacob Soboroff
FACT: There never was a plan NOR is there a plan today to reunite these children.  The only reason any children have been reunited by the government is because a judge ORDERED IT.
FACT:  There is no logical argument to support these policies -no  moral,  just or wise argument because deterrence doesn‚Äôt work it.
FACT: We aren‚Äôt talking MILLIONS of people crossing the Mexican border, it‚Äôs in the tens of thousands. Not even enough to fill the Staples Center. Trump has stated he doesn‚Äôt want to hire the manpower to handle these cases.
FACT: The refugees are coming from countries to escape gang violence, persecution, domestic and sexual abuse and government persecution.
FACT: The alternative to not crossing is DEATH.  You don‚Äôt leave your family, your country to walk across a deserted border if your life and the lives of your children are not in danger.
What was the point of separation? To STOP asylum seekers.  The result, more men, women and children are DYING because they are forced into more dangerous areas to cross. If they do not try to cross they WILL die in their home countries.
These policies would have included to reform the Flores settlement allowing to hold immigrants for longer than 20 days and it would‚Äôve included the Trump wall
Adminstration sources said they REGRET THE EXECUTIVE ORDER  ending separation bc if they could have kept going a little longer, officials would have had the leverage with Congress needed to change policies
The administration wants NO immigrants, no asylum seekers. Trump wants his wall and will do anything to get it.
Fact: Opiods  primarily come from China on airplanes in packages. It has nothing to do with the border.
FACT: 7% of US citizen commit felonies less than 2% of all immigrants commit crimes. 		FACT: More people come to this country from Asia by plane and overstay their visas than cross the border.
The policies are to SCARE.  These immigrants are escaping death.They have NO CHOICE. These are the most desperate people of the world coming from some of most dangerous places  through one of the most dangerous journeys in the world and they are trying to SEEK ASYLUM.
Trump, John Kelly, Kirstjen Nielsen, Steven Miller set this policy to scare the sh*t out of people.  		This is about POLITICS. It is baseless. There are NO facts to back up policy.  MS13 crossings are 183 out of 187,000 ppl. The DEA reports do not support spillover violence.
FACT: The President lLIES about the wall construction. There has been NO NEW construction, only reconstruction of portions of EXISTING walls which do not reflect his plan of the wall.
Hardliners since 1993 are well aware prevention through deterrence DOES NOT WORK. It doesn‚Äôt stop people from coming here.  		Tough  policies go back to Obama and Clinton. Deterrence goes back to the Clinton administration but none have been so sickening as to separate families.
This administration‚Äôs immigration policies are solely based on  PERCEPTION  instead of reality. They are rooted in politics alone. There are no facts to back up the policy.

4. So I am sending to you 2.5 bags full of bears. Sewn with love. Sewn by children, for other children. 		We do not want these families to be scared. We do not want these children to be scared. We want them here. They are welcome.
3. On July 22, she and her 2 best friends and 2 of my nieces (all children 7 years old and under) made 15 bears in 2 hours. Ms. Margaret, the owner of the school, had the children who are at her summer camp sew them up and they also made some themselves. https://t.co/dJ4dfbQyhB
2  Her mother contacted a local sewing school &amp; arranged to have her birthday party there. Where she &amp; her friends could sew bears to send to the children being separated from their parents.
1 ‚ÄúMahalia's birthday was on July 22. She turned 7. 		She heard about the immigrant children being removed from their parents from someone at camp. 		She immediately stated that she wanted to collect toys to send to these children, because she does not want them to be scared.
@Gkatz715Katz @RepJoeKennedy @misupportcircle @RepJoeKennedy those children under 5 are likely traumatized for life as they have no recent memory of their parents. Think about that.  A congressional investigation of the HHS and ICE is more than due.

‚ù§Ô∏èThe End‚ù§Ô∏è
We continue to work around the clock for these families while still giving support to the women and families we've already reunited. Please don't let this issue slip off your radar screen. The lives of our brothers and sisters and their babies are really and truly at stake.
even if that occurred outside of the zero tolerance period. We bonded out another mom in California this week and we have four more bond offers on the table, three of which (sisters) expire next week.
We do not know for sure how many more parents who were imprisoned under the zero tolerance policy remain in ICE detention centers, like Eloy, nor how many of them have bond offers. We are expanding our mission to work with *any* family separated because of ICE involvement, (cont)
and medicine and urgent care appointments. We're working in Memphis, Knoxville, Baton Rouge, Des Moines, and all points in between, leaning hard on our personal networks to take quick action to quite literally save lives.
food, clothing, diapers, and most urgently -medical intervention. Babies and children are, almost without exception, coming out of facilities with severe medical needs. Using your donations to the general fund of Immigrant Families Together, we have paid for medical visits (cont)
we have folks on the ground in Texas who are practically living at the Greyhound bus station, trying to triage and respond to needs. We exchange hundreds of messages a day, trying to catch up with parents making layovers along their journey, to provide them with (cont)
I am going to tell them what I'm telling you now: The crisis is far from over. In fact, it is even more acute. The mass release of parents and children from ICE detention has been nothing short of agonizing chaos.
An important update from our co-founder .@collazoprojects: I am in Los Angeles today because I was invited by Kristen Bell to speak to a group of LA movers and shakers who are deeply concerned about our immigration crisis and want to do something meaningful about it.

#3	We are working with lawyers on the ground to appeal her removal order and get her bond offer back. She can‚Äôt be released while the removal order is still in effect, but she can‚Äôt be deported before then, either.
#2 Unfortunately, ICE has the authority to revoke a bond offer at any time, and that‚Äôs what we found out had happened to Delmi. ICE had revoked her bond offer and had put a removal order for deportation.
#1 With your help, we were able to raise funds for Delmi‚Äôs bond. Her bond, set at $30,000, the highest among all the bonds we have paid.	On Monday, July 24th, @collazoprojects went to the ICE office in New York to post her bond.

Acordar el patrocinio en este momento puede resultar en que te detengan por m√°s tiempo o te retiren antes de volverte a reunir con ellos.
#10 Te recomendamos que hables con un abogado.
#9 Si deseas reunirte con tus hijos cuando los liberen o los retiren, a√∫n puedes aceptar que se los entreguen a un patrocinador, pero tambi√©n es importante: debes dejar en claro que no est√°s renunciando a su derecho a reunirse nuevamente.
#8 Se te puede pedir que ayudes a, o apruebes, la colocaci√≥n de tus hijos con alg√∫n pariente o patrocinador de tu comunidad. Esto no es un acuerdo de tutela. Es solo temporal.
#7 Tambi√©n te recomendamos que debes hablar con tus hijos antes de tomar una decisi√≥n.
#6 Te recomendamos que no firmes ning√∫n documento que acuerde ser repatriado sin tus hijos o que retires la oportunidad individual de tus hijos antes de hablar con un abogado, un trabajador social, o abogado que trabaje con ellos.
#5 T√∫ tienes derecho a hablar con un abogado antes de tomar una decisi√≥n cualquiera que √©sta sea.
#4 Puedes decidir irte de los Estados Unidos y solicitar llevar a tus hijos contigo. Sin embargo, tus hijos pueden tener la posibilidad de permanecer en Estados Unidos sin ti.
#3 No tienes por qu√© aceptar una orden urgente para reunirte con tus hijos. Puedes solicitar asilo u otra ayuda en los Estados Unidos y tambi√©n reunirte con ellos.
#2 ¬°Tienes el derecho de reunirte con ellos! Existen excepciones en los casos en que existan antecedentes penales o alg√∫n asunto preocupante en torno a ellos, pero a√∫n si este es el caso, debes solicitar un abogado.
#1 Estar separado de tus hijos por las autoridades de inmigraci√≥n de Estados Unidos no afecta tus derechos parentales. T√∫ tienes el derecho legal de tomar decisiones sobre tus hijos.

We are grateful to the thousands of people who have contributed to IFT's GoFundMes and who have provided volunteer manpower as well as emotional support to these peaceful asylum seekers as they make their way back to their children.
#4 Nine women are now out of detention and eight of them have been fully reunited with their children. As we write this, we are raising bond money and sustaining funds for five more women.	https://t.co/Y4LLlwz77R
#3 The hotline is staffed by volunteers across the country; these volunteers will not handle confidential information, but will refer callers to the appropriate legal entities.	We continue to bond out detained women and assure their safe transport back to their children.
#2 These families will now be in need of legal representation as they await court in a multitude of jurisdictions. The national hotline will provide families being reunified with access to legal services in whichever legal jurisdiction they end up.
#1. Today Immigrant Families Together launched a national legal referral hotline at 1-833-429-8327	 (1-833-4AYUDAS).	IFT's first action was to raise funds to bond out individual mothers from a detention centers &amp; reunite the families.

#6 As we write this, we are transporting three women ‚Äî Floridalma, Lilian, and Rosayra ‚Äî across the country to reunite with their families, and we await approval of the bond for Olga, for whom we have already raised bond.
#5 We will not rest until we have done all that we can to empty these facilities, reunite these parents with their children, and help repair the enormous trauma our country has perpetrated against these families who came here seeking a safer, better life.
#4 And we, along with Yeni, want to continue to draw attention to the women who remain at Eloy, as well as the parents who remain in ICE detention facilities around the country. Immigrant Families Together has bonded out six women in just over two weeks
#3 The Immigrant Families Together team is grateful to the hundreds of people who contributed to our GoFundMe campaign to post Yeni's bond and provide ongoing financial and moral support to her family.
#2 For 2 weeks,Yeni has been able to see her children only during supervised day visits at Cayuga. Grateful to see her children, both she &amp; her kids were growing increasingly frustrated, with Yeni unable to explain to them why she couldn't take them home at the end of each visit
#1: 15 days after we bonded Yeni out of the ICE detention in Eloy, AZ, and brought her cross-country via volunteer network to New York, where her 3 children were in foster care with Cayuga Centers, we received word after 11 PM tonight that she will take custody TODAY!

7. We are creating a toolkit to allow other concerned citizens to replicate our model in order to help bring parents back to their children across the country as quickly as possible.
6. Working with local organizations and government to expedite the process of achieving full custody of their children while they await trial.
4. When needed, finding long-term housing in the destination city while they await trial. 	5. Connecting parents in cities with resources in order to sustain them during the process of being unified with their children.
2. Paying bonds and providing pro bono legal representation to fulfill all legal responsibilities while awaiting trial so that they may be with their children. 	3. Arranging safe transportation from state of detention to the city where children are currently in foster care.
We have mobilized to help parents currently detained through the following 7 immediate actions:	1. Raising of bond funds through coordinated crowdfunding and individual giving in order to post bond for parents separated from their children at the US/Mexico Border.
