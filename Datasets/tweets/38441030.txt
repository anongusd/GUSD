Growing middle class around the world is "hungry for U.S. products," says Sonny Perdue at his confirmation hearing. #AgSec
Perdue better pack a suitcase after his confirmation hearing. Four state Senators (and counting) have offered a visit to their state. #AgSec
Perdue, who grew up on a dairy farm, says he'll tour N.Y. dairies "if you promise I don't have to milk any more cows." 🐄 🥛
Perdue says farmers are good stewards of the land and he prefers incentives for this over "onerous prescriptive regulations."
Perdue applauds hard-working family farmers: "They don't take a holiday."
Criticism from @SenStabenow on proposed @USDA budget cuts: "@realDonaldTrump has focused on making things ... but not growing things."
Re: @USDA proposed 21% budget slash, Perdue says he's had budgets he didn't like before "but I managed to it."
