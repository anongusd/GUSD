Really? that we Ambazonians don‚Äôt know what we want? meaning we did not know what we wanted in 1993 AACI, in AACII 1994 etc, and now 2016 &amp;2018 etc. was he living in mars all this while? @Oprah @angelinajollee @AngelaMerkelSPD @MofaJapan_en @Lacroix_UN @realDonaldTrump
thus wiping out Ambazonia from the face of the earth.  This is a very big insult to Ambazonians. That‚Äôs why the AACIII is just a joke	Secondly, he says we don‚Äôt know what we want.
It will also fascitate #France &amp; #Cameroon to proceed with their plan of merging the Northern zone of Ambazonia with the Western region of #Cameroon, then merge the Southern Zone of #Ambazonia with the Litoral region of #Cameroon, in what they will call a decentralized system.
That means we have to throw in the garbage #Ambazonia, #British Protectorate #SouthernCameroons from 1922 to 1961. In so doing they want us go back and start the discusion of Kamerun from 1911. This will only pave the way for what the #French &amp; #Biya #Cameroon want.
The interpretation is that if its a language problem, then we should look at the #German Kamerun of 1911. If that be the case then they mean or insinuates consciously or inconceously that #Ambazonia and #Cameroon are one based on the #German Kamerun context. @nikkihaley
This crisis is not an anglophone problem neither is it a language problem. Cad Tumi &amp; Dr Munzu are thus playing in the #Cameroon narrative that it is a language problem. @j_pedneault @MausiSegun https://t.co/8HPRduAnr4
I am disappointed with all those behind AACIII especially Dr. Munzu &amp; Cad. Tumi. First, they refer to #Ambazonians as anglophones. #Cameroons narrative is that it is an anglophone problem. Mark the characterization Anglophones! Remember, NOT ALL ANGLOPHONES ARE #AMBAZONIANS.

Because you know very well that without #SouthernCameroons, your loans to the corrupt government will never be repaired since they used #SouthernCameroons resources as collateral for the loans. I have sad news for you, all your moneys have been embezzled by Biya and his gang
@IMFLive @WorldBank @ADB_HQ @EU_Commission, #China &amp; those who loaned money to #Biya #Cameroon. You are Driectly or indirectly supporting the #GenocideInSouthernCameroons in hope that you can maintain the #Biya grip on #SouthernCameroons.
