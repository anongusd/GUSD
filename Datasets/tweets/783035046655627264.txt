@AimeeWilson @HillaryClinton I do care about pre-existing condition protections. Social security and Medicare is a joke already. I work 2 full time jobs to provide private insurance. Obama care was great for many reasons, and seriously flawed at the same time. I can use whatever word I'd like.
@BornBlue2Bone I hope so! Obama care broke me! I need better!
@LauraLoomer @PatrioticChic @RonDeSantisFL I actually live here in Florida. Dems have Florida believing he's not going to protect people with pre-existing conditions. He's not speaking on it, and might actually lose my vote too. We deserve better than that!
@catlucente @HillaryClinton I think you're lonely, and need a cat. If you actually researched instead of followingthe corrupt msm, you'd learn just how bad you've been misled.
@jazzalea @ShoelessFred @HillaryClinton Are you dumb? Follow along! Horowitz is the reason they were fired!
@RonDeSantisFL @PatrioticChic @AndrewGillum I care more about where you stand on protecting people with pre-existing conditions. You'll lose a voter!
