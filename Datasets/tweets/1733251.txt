@girltrueheart @dateableDC they're obvious.  ie, last night some girl IMed me on OKC asking me to tell her a story to prevent a panic attack
@dateableDC @DateMeDCBlog totally true, but if the messages from men aren't doing it for you, send out messages to men instead!
@dateableDC @DateMeDCBlog well, if that's creepy, then include photo, but ignore all messages sent to you, only send messages out.
@dateableDC @DateMeDCBlog I have met dozens of awesome women off OKC, and women I know in real life have met cool guys.
@dateableDC @DateMeDCBlog right, they won't, but that's why you include a link to a photo (on flickr say) in your initial message.
@DateMeDCBlog @dateableDC What about this strategy?: you use no photo (= eliminates creepy stalkers), and you only write to reasonable guys.
@DateMeDCBlog Of course it's self-serving.  They say "take with grain of salt" up front.  But does that make it less true?
@DateMeDCBlog @dateabledc so what's your take on http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/why-you-should-never-pay-for-online-dating/ ?
@dateableDC @datemedcblog true, more serious (though this surely only applies to men) but also more desperate. And is that hot? No.
@DateMeDCBlog @dateableDC disagree, because pay == willing to pay for dates == desperate.  free == casual, totally not needed @okcupid

@courtney1016 @datingcdc yes, if you want to be recognized by the state that you're a couple then it matters...
@kateschindler really?!? I had no idea. Or if I did I was confused. Maybe sort of recall this now, but we should've discussed this more!
@DateMeDCBlog not amazingly, no...we'd have to meet for drinks then if you feel like it we could head over. Few skills needed.
@datingcdc @courtney1016 what's it mean to be "fully" with someone? I call BS! Your pets, your kids, your family, they take your heart too.

@datingcdc been in a few... Very revealing. You'll grow, regardless of how it turns out.

@technmsg oh I saw both in theaters, just never any of his trailers! If I had perhaps I'd never had seen any of his films.
@technmsg I don't recall seeing any others, but lesson learned!
Xmas in LA "that's the car dealership where your uncle worked", "that's a new apartment building", "that's where Robert Blake shot his wife"
Black Swan, completely different from how the trailer made it out to be, and frankly so much better than I figured based on that.
@marissa_rae what did you have? How did it handle "on hover" events? It'd work on YouTube of course but not on most Flash games.
Black Swan and The Fighter are similar, only in one two people hit each other with their fists, and the other they fight in a boxing match.

@busbeytheelder yes a 10-year-old platform is better than a 15-year-old platform
@mscottsmith Flash sucks, Flash sucks, Flash sucks!
@marissa_rae I don't see any tech websites reporting that it'll support Flash, but it will get FroYo! http://j.mp/hoI6n3
@marissa_rae plus, Flash was designed to be used with a mouse, not a finger. It's fundamentally broken on touch screens.
@marissa_rae YouTube displays its content via HTML5 on iPad. I don't think you're going to like the Nook's performance when viewing Flash.
@marissa_rae Flash is horrible, drains battery life, and is riddled with bug and vulnerabilities. It buys you nothing you can't do in HTML5.

@simonowens You definitely should learn how to dance.  Funnest thing I've ever done (but also pretty hard).  http://bit.ly/BvnIf
@libbys Thanks for the link but it appears wrong: "The URL contained a malformed video ID."
@susannesparks is the friend a dancer? (or, will I know anyone there besides the hosts?)
@kateschindler I really need to do more tango. I always say that, so I need dancers like you to tell me when they're going so I can practice
@susannesparks thank you! I really miss you and Craig.  You two doing anything Columbas Day weekend? I keep meaning to go see Amanda too.
Had an incredible weekend at Blues Blaze in NYC... Even placed 1st in Open Jack and Jill and 3rd Open Strictly! Traveling back to DC now.
Made finals in the Blues Blaze Jack and Jill!!!
So far... SUPER fun time at Blues Blaze, even though I miss all dancers in DC.
AP: since invention of Facebook, record number of nights of mayhem.
@mhil1 wow that sounds amazing! On bus to NYC for 60 hours of nonstop dancing.

@CairoKate good choice! Also, new hair cut?!?
Airplane humor I just came up with: What do you get when you don't dance to "Get Low" enough during your flight? T-Pain Thrombosis
Packed similarly for 2 weeks in Australia as I would for a typical weekend West Coast Swing competition, only fewer items and less sparkly.
@blondponytail 2600 Baltic Ave. Come join! Dancing all weekend!

Spent at least 7 hours today editing footage of Ruddigore, got up to opening night! Still rough though.
Working from home today.  And by "working", I mean editing together 50 hours of footage from Ruddigore rehearsals and performances. Awesome!
Crap.  It's noon.  I am still in DC.  Work seems so far away at this point.  Maybe I should just stay home ... and work on Ruddigore!
Just registered for Blues Blaze in NYC, Oct 2-4.  This event should be amazing! http://www.bluesblaze.com/
@jennirach The Mall seems perfect!  (actually now that I think about, ANY mall seems kind of awesome, but the National one is what I meant)
Just tried to register for Summer Hummer, Blues Muse, and Blues Blaze, but none are available yet. Did register for Dirt Cheap Blues though!

@ErickaAndersen they're all fantastic! I also love a lot of Neko Case's albums... Check out The Virginian!
@CairoKate well, hopefully you're feeling better? I'd offer to snack you around in the good way, if only that didn't sound so kinky.
233 is the new 220, America.  Keep it up!
My 4th of July: first the grill catches on fire, now a girl is having a seizure. Good view of the mall.
The one thing I can say re: Sarah Palin: no one saw this coming, which means no one can say what the hell it could mean.
@libbys I am totally gunning for some #moonfruit
@Zhenka16 don't forget to include Tango in that list!!
@ErickaAndersen Patty Griffin - 1,000 Kisses ... Incredible!
@CairoKate re smacked around... Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
@kateschindler Jam Cellar or Lindy Hop? JC can be ... rather pretentious. But yes, it and Lindy are both way fun. So much energy!
@amosubridere You're not losing a lead in one dance, you're gaining a lead in another! :)
Kinda maybe had a ridiculously good time at Jam Cellar last night.
Really lovely afternoon in Odenton, MD, almost makes waiting for the delayed train worth it.
@graceelena anytime, though in person is always more preferable!
@mcalliph does that mean you're moving here?

#javaone #persist JPA introducing second-level cahce API...should check this out Coherence handles distributed caching
#javaone #persist Anti-Mallory principle: "Just because it's tehre doesn't mean you should be using it." but corner cases, legacy db better
#javaone #persist persist XML messages?  that'd be amazing
#javaone #persist Idea: is there a tech that takes an xsd, creates java source that also has JPA annotations in it, so that you can easily
#javaone #persist JPA2 allows you to have dervied identifiers, just add @Id to a @OneToOne mapping, no need to create an additional field
#javaone #persist Talking abouat embeddable objects, pretty slick, powerful stuff with AttributeOverride
#javaone #persist Using a map for relationships: @OneToMany(mappedBy="dep"), @MapKey(key="name") (this looks up empl in dept by name via ...
#javaone #persist My experience is that DBAs hate ORM, so that Oracle not only likes JPA, but in fact contributes to API is awesome
#javaone #persist Personal comment: I think it's totally awesome this ORM talk is being given by a guy that works for Oracle.
#javaone #persist Discussing Element Collection Mapping, when you want to give an Object a collection of things (eg, employee's nicknames)
#javaone #persist an example of a 2.0 mapping, a OneToOne Mapping based on a JoinTable
#javaone #persist all mappings in 2.0 are simply corner cases, rarely used, 1.0 has all common mappings; often used for legacy databases
#javaone #persist Many to many rel; @JoinTable(name="EMP_PHONE")
#javaone #persist @OneToMany(mappedBy="Employee.dep") (empl owns deps, but many empls in one dept)
#javaone #persist There's a notion of ownership in JPA; if you define a directional rel, you're the owner.  If bidir, both own.
#javaone #persist @OneToOne creates foreign key to another table's ID (name of attribute automatically get _id appended to end of db col)
#javaone #persist @Entity == persist this class, @Id == you're the id for this table, @Lob == large object (binary)
#javaone #persist Just a personal comment: I think annotating classes to achieve ORM is SOOO much better than creating XML configuration
#javaone #persist "Any DBA can do better than any ORM software creating schemas" -- keep this in mind, as an option
#javaone #persist logical level meatadata - describes object model, physical level metadata - describes data model
@peakevale er, nevermind!  cool topic

http://bit.ly/Vz7LG	 TRUE THAT
#javaone #hardware finally, "premature optimization is the root of much evil"...you need to profile deeply these new multicore CPUs
#javaone #hardware shared data == okay, mutable data == okay, shared + mutable == bad.  immutability is a way nice thing == i agree with ...
#javaone #hardware according to speakers, data conversion is now the WORST THING EVER.  so don't convert!  if you have XML, just regex
#javaone #hardware cmt allows you to parallel each thread per core or CPU
#javaone #hardware interesting talk, but not sure of its relevance to 99% of java devs.  anyway, "time to reboot RISC", make it even RISCier
#javaone #hardware "memory is the new disk" (when talking about data locality...we need to relearn the tricks we knew about in the 80s)
#javaone #hardware in multicore, not all caches locally visible to all CPU cores == BAD NEWS, we have to deal with this when coding
#javaone #hardware we always see improvements in bandwidth, but not as much in latency == BAD NEWS
#javaone #hardware DRAM memory access times doubles every 6 years, CPU speed doubles every 1.5 years == BAD NEWS
#javaone #hardware x86 miss rates are low, but 100-1000 cycles wasted per hit, so even if 5% miss, still huge cost
#javaone #hardware Itanium tried to make an "infinite" machine, tons of Ph.D. research done on compilers for it, but didn't work
#javaone #hardware major current CPU time is spent by waiting on cache misses (300 clock cycles or so per miss)
#javaone #hardware ILP = instruction level parallelism, keep the clock rate same, get more instructions processed == great idea, hard to do
#javaone #hardware clock rates been flat for 5 years, but Moore's law still works. just scale the cores in CPU, but this raises challenges
#javaone #hardware problems with RISC: power wall (chip melts!), hit limit of branch prediction, memory is still way too slow, speedoflight
#javaone #hardware so dawned the era of RISC, enabled parallelism because everything so was similar; but it became hard for humans to do
#javaone #hardware BUT CISC was hard to pipeline because of so many addressing modes, BUT it was highly predictable... (page faults were key
#javaone #hardware 3 eras of hardware, CISC systems, designed to be programmed by humans, orthogonal instruction set, lots of addr'sing mode

#javaone #drools demoing some badass looking fedex tracking app thing that uses ArcGIS for Flash in the browser...really cool GUI! give2us!!
#javaone #drools when you're doing temporal reasoning, it's important to control the clock. implement a "pseudo clock" for testing
#javaone #drools man, i WISH FedEx were this accurate in their delivery times, but anyway drools makes the time accuracy simple!
RT @peakevale: @clydeiii http://bit.ly/e2PED The Power Of Events: Intro to CEP book recommended by the presenters in the #javaone #drools
#javaone #drools talking about using drools to make FedEx shipments more reliable, more accurate in their times of delivery
#javaone #drools http://yfrog.com/eavmkj complex slide of fedex shipping events
#javaone #drools authors recommend book "The Power of Events" I think it was....
#javaone #drools most rules engines have no understandings of changes over time, but drools can deal with time windows, sliding patterns
#javaone #drools they want to make it easy to figure out when an event DOESN'T happen...this is really hard to do in a POJO, they claim
#javaone #drools but rules engines often don't have enough comparators that deal with time, so it appaers they've added them into drools
#javaone #drools Ah, so they solved this by something called entry-point, which are multithreaded entry points into the rules engine
#javaone #drools rues engines do not scale for CEP, complex event processing... (was thinking that they look similar)
#javaone #drools oh, nice.  showing a rule that queries first a hibernate source for buses in a certain zip, returns "rich" busses
@peakevale Alcohol candy?  Where do we get it?
#javaone #drools rules engines have data put into them (giant hashmap), data goes through filters, actions happen when rules are hit
#javaone #async questioner saying how ws not good metaphor for async, REST is better for async. Presenter says REST==SOAP.

#javaone #async demoing the @AsyncWebService annotation
#javaone #async RI AsyncProvider is only suitable for short duration
#javaone #async for JAX-WS you implement the callback; WS-Addressing allows you to do this without callback
#javaone #async "endpoint references" are essential in this topic, they tell you where to send message along with relevant metadata
#javaone #async HTTP you have to use polling ("are you done, are you done"), inefficient, JMS with queues, firewall probs, java2java only
#javaone #async client inits an async call, sometime later a response is sent back to the client (we're assuming the server can talk back)
#javaone #async two interfaces: polling and callback, generated when you do WSDL to Java  with an async WSDL
#javaone #async "Dealing with Asynchronicity in Java Technology-Based Web Services" kicking off--not about AJAX or Comet
@erdoland wow, that ring is super pretty
Crappy shot of #Fuji graphical editor #javaone #eip http://yfrog.com/5chdgj
#javaone #eip demoing #Fuji's graphical EIP editor thingy.  looks cool, runs in web browse...#Eclipse support maybe?  whatev
@peakevale haha, i know, i saw you!
#javaone #eip #camel wow he is really selling me on the ability to mess around with JMS messages on the fly for debugging
#javaone #eip demo using #ActiveMQ, which, for the record, is totally badass.  oh, "quick call to log component" of #Camel == totally cool
#javaone #eip okay this guy was totally using some graphical pom editor i've never seen before...what was that?!  want!! #maven
#javaone #eip #camel #maven awesome, makes it really easy to create a cbr using a maven archetype via an #Eclipse plugin
@peakevale Can definitely see "delayer" being way useful
@peakevale Yeah, #Camel looks a surprisingly lot like #SpringIntegration
@peakevale I think it's JRuby...i mean, it looks like Ruby at least.
#javaone #eip #fuji demoing dynamic content-based router, the #jruby code DOES make thing ridiculously simple...
#javaone #eip this #fuji thing is an interesting way of looking at the problem; declare pattern, override functionality with generated code
#javaone #eip demoing throttler and delayer (delay messages based on, say, a header value, or throttle the number of messages passed through
#javaone #eip you can also do this with a transformer bean in the #spring world
#javaone #eip now demoing how you simply create a RouterBuilder and intercept the messages, transform them, easily do that with "process"
#javaone #eip implementing "dead letter' pattern is easy.  all you need to do is create RouterBuilder...
#javaone #eip #camel #spring way to configure this content-based router as well.  yep, seems kind of like SpringIntegration
#javaone #eip #camel showing RouteBuilder, a content-based router, seems pretty easy to pull from ActiveMQ, put onto other queues
#javaone #eip #fuji #camel talking about implementing pipes-and-filters in a jruby like script, outputting to xmpp
Just learned my apartment has been flooded in DC... :(
#javaone #gc presented generated his slides via Google's ppt generator, actually wrote GC algorithm then had it generate slides based on it!
#javaone out of batteries, shutting down for the evening!  goodnight!
#javaone #gc just explained the 10 steps of the gc...wow, complex!  well presented though.
#javaone #gc levels of reach: strong, soft, weak, finalizer, phantom, unreachable
#javaone #gc recommends Google Collections MapMaker, "mad fast" for creating non-existance values given keys upon get()s
#javaone #gc WeakHashMap makes it so that when you get rid of the object containing the map,it'll remove all values associated with its keys
@mhil1 please tweet results!
#javaone #gc try implementing your own WeakPhantom reference type
#javaone #gc encourages us to check out implementation of #Google Collection's FinalizableReferenceQueue
#javaone #gc using phantom reference to get rid of the memory leak in the "NativeMemory" example he discussed earlier
#javaone #gc now demoing how oyu can use WeakReference to store LIsteners in a GUI; if owner gets rid, so does GUI
#javaone #gc explaining how you can use this SoftReference to cache file from a data ... really cool
#javaone #gc The Reference API @since 1.2 helps with this.  soft references are for caching.  you can use vmargs to tune how fast reclaim
#javaone #gc finalizers are really just good for one thing: logging warnings; but then you still get the 430x performance hit
@javaone @gc Bloch found objects with finalizers to be 430x slower
#javaone #gc Automatic Resource Management will help with finally in Java7
#javaone #gc finally is your friend in helping out the gc: straightforward, handles exceptions in main thread, ensures cleanup keeps pace
#javaone #gc "Ghost in the Machine" is about garbage collection and understanding it
@m_f_ #SpringIntegration 1.0 is awesome.  When's 2.0 coming out?  Anything at #JavaOne about it?
#javaone #soa #GlassFish guys wrote a more automated assembler, contributed it back to the community
#javaone #soa you can always tell the quality of the talk by the amount of people looking at their iPhones and Blackberrys. Lots here.
#javaone #soa talking up #NetBeans Service Assembly editor, only suitable for smaller complexity, it's something you click, not automated
#javaone #soa solution to geography in distributions is NOT zipping data, but Fast Infoset, a binary representation of XML
#javaone #soa solution to the long-running transactions challenge is WS-Reliable Messaging
#javaone #soa "dynamic content-based routing" listed as a technical challenge--this is true, but is solvable via dependency injection
#javaone #soa slide says "content based rooting based on country code" ... i guess like at a World Cup soccer match
#javaone #soa they use #soapUI to do development, probably debugging...they didn't say really, but that's what we use it for. #Hulp Profiler
#javaone #soa um...this talk is kinda confusing.  slides confusing, graphics too busy, no clear theme or structure
#javaone #esb all of these all have their own architectures, ideas about how SOA works, all need to work together and exist alongside ea ...
#javaone #esb and these three sings are all hooked together via WANs
#javaone #soa talking about how they think there are global architectures, regional architectures, local architectures, each with own ESB
#javaone #soa impressive graph of a country's services with lines between each service representing use
#javaone #soa "SOA at the Enterprise Scale", about SOA in "real life", problems encountered, solutions discovered, challenges faced
#javaone #cep proposing a challenge: write a CEP query that will detect players colluding in poker based on event stream of wins and losses
@adara9 dave moldover will be there, supposedly!
#javaone #cep design pattern 8: missing event detection, alert if an expected event is missing after some amount of time
#javaone #cep design pattern 7: instead of using times relative to the CEP engine, use times meaningful to events (like buy time, etc)
#javaone #cep design pattern 6: event correlation, for instance, output an new type of event if the "asking for" and the "selling" equal
@libbys Funny, but was wondering what the last comment meant (Gibbs' "FML").  Google told me: http://www.fmylife.com -- HILARIOUS
#javaone #cep design pattern 5: event aggregation of several simply events into a single new complex events summarizing the simple events
#javaone #cep design pattern 4: event enrichment, add info to events that are interested to you. (add location to stock if price of stock&gt;5)
#javaone #cep design pattern 3: event partitioning ... sort of like the SQL "order by"...you can "partition by" symbol (column of an event)
#javaone #cep design pattern 2: new event detection...only output events the FIRST time you've seen it
#javaone #cep the "NOW" thingy looks at the most recent instant of time; stockstream is our event stream of stock trades passing through
#javaone #cep the "cql" (continuous query language) for this is SELECT * FROM stockstream [NOW] WHERE symbol = 'AAA'
#javaone #cep first design pattern: event filtering: look for sepcific data on stream, dropping unwanted events
#javaone #cep building blocks roundup: continuous processing of oneline stremaing events, append-only, sql-like, but the inverse of #SQL
#javaone #cep Talk is starting, laying down fundamentals of CEP: events, event streams
@peakevale I am!  See you then
@peakevale #javaone no, am at "Design Patterns for CEP"
#javaone #modularity talking about "module private" friends and methods--really cool concept...i like this scoping.
#javaone #modularity versioning lets the vector of a change be described
#javaone #modularity @DefaultNonNull model-level annotations
#javaone #modularity the "provides" clause makes modulepath scalable, aliasing allows clients to not be affected by refactoring
@CraigSparks nice!
#javaone #modularity classpath doesn't scale (#Sun just admitted this)
#javaone #modularity talking about mutual depedencies...says they just can't not support them
#java #modularity "classpath is dead" ... almost ... "modulepath" is the new classpath
#javaone .java is just a convention #modularity
#javaone #modularity discussing the "requires module java-xml" construct
#javaone #modularity this is all strong static type information, allows early detection of errors, build compile-time env that can confirm
#javaone #modularity you want to explicity list dependencies on other code, version, and provide accessibility
#javaone #modularity modular code is: clear about what other code it depends on, able to evolve, able to hide internals
#javaone #modularity warming up in here, talk starting, disclaimer: change is inevitable.
@peakevale i bet you can only get halfprice tix the day of...
@peakevale Modularity is right now.  Which half-price tix counter?  For what show?
@peakevale cool, let's talk about it soon... are you going to the #modularity talk? #javaone
RT @peakevale: Just left the "Concurrency" talk - definite Rockstar talk... wow, there are really great paradigms!  #javaone
#javaone #modularity holy crap it's cold in 102, hope people show up and make it a bit warmer
#javaone #esb now they're showing the source the gui made, it's just jruby ... interesting!
#javaone #esb demoing something called #Fuji, like a graphical ESB-like building tool, moving files from ftp to database, xpath filtering
#javaone #esb #apache #felix looks pretty cool for #OSGi
#javaone #esb the everything-from-one-vendor approach is limiting, alloow users to mix and match best of breed solutions (standards help)
#javaone #esb open source: customers increasingly demand it, easy to eval, better interaction with customers, better products
#javaone #esb (personal observation, not in talk) we've noticed that even IF you choose open source, standards, JBI, you're still locked in
#javaone #esb costumers don't want vendor lock-in, stick with open standards, open source, provide an option to exit
#javaone #esb HTTP has less impedance mismatch to #SOA, don't have to force everything into MOM
#javaone #esb #JMS requires yet more infrastructure, HTTP provides proven scalability and interoperability; JMS is just another transport
#javaone #esb component-component message-passing can be done without JMS, JBI model improves performance
#javaone #esb (personal observation, not in talk) we use Spring Integration to reduce JMS overhead, bottlenecks
#javaone #esb #JMS is often a bottleneck, but when everything starts looking like a message, that's when you start having problems.
#javaone #esb use mainstream languages, frameworks, look for "staying power" when understaking a very long-term project
#javaone #esb systems stay in production for many years, langs, frameworks lose popularity, support, so reduce reliance on IDE
#javaone #esb always version-control builds; be very caseful about code generation (move it into runtime)
#javaone #esb OSGi is a good solution for having more than one library in the system and having different parts of the system choose which v
#javaone #esb move configuration away from the compile-time code, avoid rebuilding "the world" for small business logic changes
#javaone #esb project artifacts grow quickly, so reduce artifacts per solution, move common functionality out of EAR containers
#javaone #esb devs spend a lot of time waiting, shorten change-build-deploy-test cycle, increase testability, debugability
#javaone #esb you want to be able to work with your technologies, not the technologies constrained up on you by the ESB (also so true)
#javaone #esb it's always a guess how someone will use your product, so it's always a guess how any particular framework you choose will fit
#javaone #esb make it easy to duplicate solutions without duplicating code (YES, THIS IS SO TRUE)
#javaone #esb don't over rely on either text or GUI, make the installer fast
#javaone #esb enterprises like to scale by adding people
#javaone #esb non-functional requirements enterprise-scale integration; "change happens", long term commitments
#javaone #esb lightweight=quick to learn, not complex, productivity, modular, embeddable, easy to evolve, manage, but what are requirements?
#javaone #esb Cons: architecture, more middleware, lock-in Pros: productivity, decoupling, service intermediaries, not everything is a ws
#javaone #esb feedback comes in the form of changing env, requirements, research, positive fb from customers, negative from thought leaders
#javaone #esb backgrounds in #OpenESB, #Glassfish
#javaone #esb And we're on with "Rethinking the ESB: lessons learned"
RT @goul #javaone general tech session - best comb-over of show, suspect this one will be tough to beat. So true!!
Arg totally out of battery on both laptop and cell phone, no more tweets today. #javaone :(
Gotta admit, life-sized Duke is freaking cute. Pretty girl too (one of the few) http://yfrog.com/5dcjjcj http://yfrog.com/5aakkj #javaone
Trying to get speaker to nail Dow timeframe of changes in 7, won't fall for it. #javaone #smallchanges
#javaone #smallchanges Changes that mess with type are way, way harder than those that don't.  Tiny -&gt; Huge change scale is exponential.
#javaone #smallchanges simplified catching exceptions, so you can declare each subtype but do the same thing with each.  Nice feature.
#javaone #smallchanges Talking about how making a small change effects many, many things.
#javaone #smallchanges Hmm, wow, this talk is getting way theoretical way quick.
#javaone #smallchanges basically talking about how they really labor over each submitted change proposal.  Comparing to napsack problem, NPh
#javaone #smallchanges int mask = 0b1010; == AWESOME ... also 0xFFu means unsigned == AWESOME. THANK YOU
@peakevale No, what was it? (went to lunch)
#javaone Small Language Changes in Java 7.0 talk starting up
@MsKrieger There, you're already Tweeting like an old-timer!  Well done. :)
#Eclipse #javaone Speaker just said phase "differently abled" person.  But seriously the accessibility features are pretty cool.
#Eclipse #EclipseLink is a JPA, XML binding, web-services thingy.  Never heard of it, sounds interesting. #javaone
@adara9 It only shows its value when there are tons of people all using all at the same time at  same event. Really cool when that happens.
@adara9 Twitter is awesome for a few things, but one is "real-time" stuff...like how I'm using it at #JavaOne.
#Eclipse #Equinox gets rid of bizarre classpath loading-related problems.  That's good. #javaone
Eclipse is very graphical...but not one screenshot in the PowerPoint.  Steve Jobs he is not.  #eclipse #javaone
#Eclipse okay this talk is driving me crazy.  Talking about the new #Galilieo release, BUT HAS TO SAY RELEASE DATE.  #javaone #fail
#javaone What's everyone opinion of #DarkChat?
Model Development Tools in #Eclipse sounds useful.  Last time I tried to do #UML stuff it was a pain in the ass. #javaone
This #Eclipse talk is boring it makes me want to use #Netbeans.  #javaone
#Eclipse #Buckminster gets you working much faster.  Sounds interesting, never heard of it before.
The #Eclipse Foundation employs 0 developers.  They can only go in the directions of their end-user developers.  #javaone
Window Builder  GUI building plugins. Dares to come up with something better than Window Builder, but it costs $200. #javaone
@peakevale Your talk sounds so much better than mine. #Eclipse #javaone
"#Eclipse was not designed to be an IDE, does that shock anyone?" No.  No it does not.  #javaone #snark
#Eclipse talk at #Javaone is way boring so far.  Maybe I already know too much about Eclipse to get much out of it...dunno.
Hardly anyone has used #Eclipse's #Galileo releases yet.  Talking about "release train".  #javaone
@peakevale What talk?  (use the #javaone hashtag, btw, and obtain many followers)
#Eclipse 80% of the stuff we write the end user doesn't care about.  SO TRUE.  You buy apps because of business value it provides. #javaone
#Eclipse Foundation's goal is to enable a commercial ecosystem, not ship products or IDEs. #javaone
#Eclipse #javaone pretty much everyone in the session is using Eclipse.  Only a few people making plugins.
@libbys Sorry Libby!
At the #Eclipse talk, 3 minutes till it goes on.  They're playing some awesome Brazilian music. #Shazam can't tag it though. #javaone
#JRuby guy talking about Ruby gems, with dependency management.  Tons of gems available, 4million devs by 2013.  #Rake build tool.  #javaone
@kateschindler What's on Hulu?
#Scala am loving the way he's CRUDing with the database inside of the language's syntax.  Awesome!  #javaone
#Scala guy says there's even more of a difference between scripting languages and dbs than there is between OO languages and dbs. #javaone
Interesting how #Clojure source almost looks like #Spring xml configuration files. #javaone
#javaone Want to go to both the #Clojure talk and the #Eclipse talk at 12:30, but will probably choose Eclipse.
#Clojure has a book.  Dev is doing a full hour tech talk about it.  Hmm.  Maybe I'll attend instead of whatever else I have scheduled.
#Groovy dev is showing source code for #Twitter app he wrote with #Gryphon.
@JavaOneConf Yeah, if you could announce each speaker's Twitter account (like on their intro slide or something) we could @reply to them!
#Groovy not just language, but a platform.  #Grails is a framework similar to #Rails.  #Gryphon is a #Swing app maker.  #javaone
Every scripting language representative on stage is using a #Mac. #shootout #javaone
#Jython talking about #MIT artists using Jython to create art, they made an "IDE" to help them.  IDE has sliders built in into the source.
#JRuby guy said he's added unit class into the 3D rendering engine with only a few lines of code.  #javaone
#javaone #shootout Guy just said, "I just lost the game."  I just lost the game too.
#javaone Question for you: what's the one thing you wish your TV could do that it currently can't?
#javaone #shootout Demoed some badass 3D graphical game in #JRuby
#javaone #shootout now talking about #Scala, interesting "match" construct, shortened exception handling.  Figures out type dynamically.
#javaone Sorry, that's actually #clojure.  Seems like a pretty cool language.
#javaone Talking about a scripting language called #Closure, badass transaction management.
#javaone Hey #scriptinglanguages Shootoff techies, increase the font size of your IDEs.  We can't see back here in the back.
#javaone At Scripting Language Shootout.  Python already talked.  Now it's Groovy from #SpringSource.  Talking about removing boilerplate.
Question for you: what the thing you wish you could do on your TV that you currently can't?
Getting tons of random people following me on Twitter. Upsetting all of my friends on Facebook. Just covering #JavaOne guys. Sorry!
Larry just said programmers will pray for Gosling for the rest of their life because they can never code in AJax again, instead FX. #javaone
Larry Ellison on stage. Says new Oracle products 100% Java. Had to add realtime tech into Java, possible through JSR.
Ooh, juicy. Talking about #Oracle acquistion stuff. Making jokes about getting #Java on #iPhone. Don't joke, just do! #javaone
Randy Bryant of CMU getting award for the #Alice programming language. Version 3 out, integrated with #Netbeans. The Sims characters in it.
Being a great leader takes courage. Scott McNealy on stage now. Schwartz being thanked for taking Sun into open source.
#Schwartz and #Gosling making fun of each others' attire.
Have to day I am impressed by the App store concept. Really great way to make some quick and easy money for Java devs. #javaone
Mark Gerhard demoing RuneScape looks like Ultima 8 (the one that came out in 1998 if I recall). Now downloadable on appstore.
App store is backend RESTful, frontends can take many forms. #javaone Preview built into the store, nice. Ooh, #RuneScape. Pretty.
Sun basically making Java app store like the Apple app store. http://store.java.com free twitter client, according to screenshot!
James Gosling on stage, wearing store.java.com tshirt. Talking about how Java developers are living in poverty? Huh? Is it that bad?
Link to #micello: http://get.micello.com I think #javaone
Randini Ramani talking about FX content dev tool. Demo not working, magic techie just fixed it. Looks like Apple's iDVD but cross platform.
#JavaFX developer talking about 1.2. Putting JavaFX into HD TVs directly (not the set top box) #javaone
Chicago Options Exchange developer talking about how they grew from 2k to 300k transactions per second. 100% Sun, Java shop. GC times better
Atom will enable 5.5b people who are NOT currently on the Internet. New Xeon chip best chip for Java currently.
First woman on stage, Diane Bryant from Intel. "really optimized platform" for Java. Talking about Core, Atom platforms.#javaone
Metadata = presence, location, friends and family (ie social networks). Sounds cool and interesting, unlike other networks. #javaone
Lowell McAdam of Verizon says they've been closed. Guess they're "opening" up with Java. Talking about opening up network metadata.
Don Eklund of Java pimping the evil BluRay platform which I guess uses Java technology to take away fair use rights. #javaone
Premier BB phone entirely written in Java. Demo of some app nearly just crashed.
Alan's phone just went off, seemed geniunely embarrassed by his ringtone.

Chris Melissinos speaking, 14th #JavaOne. Maryland one of the represented states. Holla 301!
Live DJ spotted. Besides James Gosling, probably the coolest person here. #javaone
There may or may not be a live DJ at the #JavaOne General Conference. There is at least a video of one. About to start.
@caralich a plant of some kind. Shows you care.
The impossibly large line for breakfast magically shrunk. #javaone
Just checked in, got official #JavaOne swag (tshirt, backpack, jacket, random nerd junk), walked the Expo, ate free cookie.
Got 5th in last night's Strictly at Two Left Feet, but was sad to hear that it's Friday nights that have the best West Coast Swing.
@blondponytail Susan Boyle is technically not that good.  Actually, she's pretty bad, technically.  But she has some natural talent.
@beyondblues Mihai, meant to say this last night but I really enjoyed your classes last night.  Blues is so hard to teach.
Having a wonderfully relaxing morning/afternoon. Probably sightseeing later today, then West Coast Swing on the West Coast at Two Left Feet.
@busbeytheelder Approve
@libbys Olympic style or circular?  You can take Olympic-style trampoline lessons at certain gyms.  Olympic ones allow you to jump 50 ft up!
@beyondblues Enjoyed Harley's set a lot, bit then again I like weird sets. :)
Six hours of Friday Night Blues = sore feet
@marissa_rae Oh man it was sooo wet when I left my place around 630 this morning.  I mean, no rain, just like thick in the air.
Think I'll go walk around downtown SF with my camera.  Where to, followers? #sf
#followfriday @sockington I have to admit, if I were to ever get a cat, it would need to Tweet as hilariously as this one.  Tall order.
My hotel is 0.8 miles away from @beyondblues.  I am in heaven.
@beyondblues Yes, Twitter is awesome, for lots of reasons.  Anyway, I'm fresh of the boat from DC and looking to dance tonight. So excited!
@alemon Maybe you "had a little bit too much" (oh, oh o oh!)?
Beautiful in #SF.  I love how everything is trying to be lush, but the sun says "no" and so everything's resigned to being washed out.
@Pogue "You should buy me a drink."
@kateschindler haha I am totally going to do that too!
@libbys omg thank you for this!
@susannesparks Bmore Aquarium!
@peakevale see you soon!
@alemon is it true?
San Francisco and JavaOne here I come! #sf #javaone
@kateschindler I don't know.  Probably something awesome like make fun of your favorite radio station.  ASSUMING YOU EVEN HAVE ONE.
Flying out to JavaOne tomorrow at 7:50!
@kateschindler Are you mocking my favorite radio station?!? Grr... :)
NPR's been great this morning: monkeys, Chinese writers, spellers, and orchestrators. Also got cast in Jim's one act!
@marissa_rae plot sum? Sell me!
@TammySassin depends on the dance, depends on the dude. You could always do 7-9 dinner, 9-12 dance
@mollymali Twitter Opera review?
@TammySassin In the Billboard Hot 100? Boom Boom Pow, Poker Face, Blame It, Don't Trust Me, and Sugar.  The other 5 are all too slow.
Had a fun audition last night for Montgomery Playhouse's One Act festival and is now getting excited for San Francisco!!!
Driving home from 8.5 hours of blues dancing. Zzzzzz.
@graceelena there's a twitter Facebook app (ie you update twitter and the fb app realizes this and posts it to your fb status as well)
Eating multiple raw Pillsbury products and watching the 90210 season finale.  OMG!  (It takes a real man to admit things like this.)
@anamariecox I've loved the Austin Grill brunch the few times I've gone, but then again I sort of just love combining salsa and coffee.
Oh wow, Elvis impersonator at Blob's Park next Friday.  Too bad I'll be in San Francisco.
Good tunes tonight at Colvin Run, @davemoldover
@Pogue God bless you, after a sneeze.
@libbys if you're still there after midnight let me know, I live near there!
Have only had 4 dances at Colvin Run tonight but 3 of then have been incredibly amazing, so I guess it's worth it.
iMovie might not be as powerful as Final Cut Studio, but its interface is genius. It reads your mind and then does exactly what you want.

@Pogue 2 Pulp 2 Fiction. 4 God 4 Father.
@libbys Mmm affogato... Saw that flapper dress at H&M and thought it'd be Lindy popular. You missed a fun dance though!
Just Heard about QT's "Inglorious Bastards" on NPR. Jewish-American WWII soldiers skin Nazis behind enemy lines. Sounds amazing!
@blondponytail ripped her up as in made fun of her?
@blondponytail tweet if a girl named Crazy Kate is on it!! I've danced with her.
@libbys twitter is the new evite. Yes!
Tweeting on the 439 MARC train is the best.
@libbys Think a break might involve a trip to the Folger?
@libbys Because of marquee and blink, I created an internal wiki page at my work called "List of the ugliest websites on [our intranet]".
@busbeytheelder Depends on how much functionality you want your BBS to have. Does this not already exist?
@Pogue "The Ally": mockumentry about the friendship of five homeless vagabonds
@erdoland For a moment I thought you wrote "Second Life", which would be sadder, although also more hilarious.
@katieschmatie7 do you need a stripper? Cause I need an audience.
@marissa_rae wait did you break up with Daniel?!? (interesting observation nonetheless)
@katieschmatie7 go see them at the Kennedy ( assuming you are getting married that day or whatever)!
Really enjoyed the 18th St Singers' Haunted!
On my way to Haunted at the Strathmore :) by myself :(.
Thinking of going to 18th St. Singers' "Haunted" at Strathmore Wed and Folger's production of Arcadia soon. Anyone interested in either?
@alemon "down"? Rawwr!
@erdoland go to sleep before 7:30 tonight maybe? (congrats on the book too)
