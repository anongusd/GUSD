@Prufrockery @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN Don't be mad at American exceptionalism. You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink saying is coming to mind. Those poor children u speak of, where are their parents? What kind of education do their parents have? Yada yada yada. Feel free to adopt a few if u can
@Prufrockery Capitalism if u didnt know is that fabulous economic &amp; political system embraced by America &amp; other well off countries where the trade &amp; industry are controlled by private owners for PROFIT, rather than by the state. Oh those profiteers are very generous too by the way. #Freedom
@Prufrockery @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN I haven't checked the past few days but Im sure our stock markets are on fire. America's GDP is rockin' &amp; w/ all of our failings we R #1 in the world. President Trump has done us a solid. Capitalism over socialism any day. Even w/ half the US hating on our President its amazing.
@Prufrockery @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN It just won't work in America. Our system works, that's why people are begging to come here.
@Prufrockery @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN Your trickle up theory makes 0 sense and 0 cents that is why Venezuela is in trouble. Economic theory is not your fortay. Stay in your lane. Who created the steel industry, communications, transportation industries, etc etc etc in America...Not socialists.
@Prufrockery @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN He gave tax cuts to all. Oh u think the not-so-well-off are creating jobs, lol. Wow, u really r brainwashed. Rich people create jobs to make $ &amp; help their communities but I bet u've never created a job in your life. U probably think they fall out of trees or fall out of the sky.
@Prufrockery @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN Complaining just to complain is nonsense. There are alot of problems all around America (for many demographics and coincidentally alot of those problem areas are governed by Democrats...oh I mean MOST. Learn the truth. #FactsMatter
@Prufrockery @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN I'll check it out but it still doesn't change the fact that a path to citizenship for DACA, chain migration, visa overstays, illegal migration, extreme vetting and other immigration issue need to be fixed or part of a comprehensive immigration bill in America. #CommonSense
@Prufrockery @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN Look at that, we can agree on a few things: voter suppression sucks and gerrymandering is sideways stupid but hey, democracy isn't perfect but it sure beats dictatorships, socialism, and/or communism anyday and twice on Sunday.
@Prufrockery @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN @POTUS By the way, I am not pretending you have a mental illness, I am wondering IF you do, lol. Knowledge is power and I blessed to have received it, retained it and can apply it in the real world. Ur opinions are suspect but it's your source material that has damaged your ideas maybe.
@Prufrockery @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN You putting this article up shows your source material is suspect, lol. But what I will do is print it, wipe my butt w/ it while I read Cosmos by Carl Sagan while sitting on the toilet and debate w/ U on @POTUS's solid policy and agenda, lol.
@Prufrockery @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN @POTUS In the U.S., parents can go to jail if their kids don't go to public school when they are suppose to. Today parents can go to jail for spanking their kids. Parents go to jail for neglect all the time but can kill a kid right out the womb cause u don't want it after birth?
@Prufrockery @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN I never said they weren't rare but it is important to understand &amp; analyze issues &amp; new legislation brought up in all 50 States &amp; the federal level. Don't get it twisted, I like debating but more than that I love being right &amp; dunking facts on ignorant people. #ItsMyPleasure
@Prufrockery @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN @POTUS Did you know it is a double homicide (murder) if a pregnant woman (child in her womb or stomach, if you prefer) is killed by another human being ? How can a doctor kill a late term pregnancy but someone go to prison for a child in the womb. Something is off there wouldn't U say?
@Prufrockery @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN @POTUS A bigot can also be a person who is intolerant toward those holding different opinions. Boy, have I been tolerant of your blah, but I don't believe u've been tolerant of my different opinions, it's all good. I'm better at Jeopardy than my lady &amp; she gets mad about it so I get it.
@Prufrockery @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN U should read state statutes in Virginia &amp; NY and explain to me what is allowed/not allowed? I don't believe u r aware of what is possible, what is intended &amp; what some want to happen. Any abortion (except for the sake of a woman's health) shouldn't be allowed after 2nd trimester
@Prufrockery @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN Birth day &amp; birthday are 2 different concepts, just to let u know but your English is getting better, I assume. No sir or m'am, that retweet stays. When a baby is born, I want it given medical care &amp; then adopted to someone else, not killed. #DoYouFeelMe #PickUpWhatIAmPuttingDown
@Prufrockery @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN u don't get it! What its trying to say is DAY OF BIRTH Abortions. You see in this country certain ppl (future serial killers &amp; mass murders some call them) want abortions to be allowed right after they come out of their mom's womb. Can't support murder of kids, are you trippin'?
@Prufrockery @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN @POTUS I don't believe you are being factual in this statement. Emotional responses while cute and cuddly dont prove my @POTUS is a bad guy. I believe in my heart of hearts he means well. Don't listen to #fakenews &amp; biased paid pundits. Common sense proper policies matter always.
@Prufrockery @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN Maybe I didnt communicate this correctly: Late term abortion and infanticide (which is a new thing these days) is wrong, period, endstop. Law and order dictates Roe vs Wade is the law of the land unfortunately, so it must be followed but I just hope it is 'safe and rare'. Agree?
@Prufrockery @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN Patriotism in U.S. is more tham reciting &amp; familiarity w/ my U.S. Constitution, love of baseball, apple pie &amp; the American flag. It's the intangibles of love of community, empathy for our neighbors, capitalism- our chosen economic system, respect for law &amp; order, &amp; individualism
@Prufrockery @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN Like I said I don't focus on the fringe elements in any societal trends or thoughts. Or at least I hope I don't. I defend the better good &amp; proper policy, help those who can't help themselves and ridicule those who deserve it, while giving respect when it's due.
@Prufrockery @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN What? I am not white, I am a red blooded American with a beautifully mixed heritage. Your getting hot over there and causing climate change, lol.
@Prufrockery @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN Lol, after rereading this tweet from you, I am positive you understood my tweet precisely.
@Prufrockery @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN I do my best to be silly but that article looks like a hit piece on Jews disguised as a provocative and intelligent article. If you are a Palestinian sympathizer that is fine but don't get testy because I fully support Israel and the Jewish people, please and thank you.
@ButtyPretterfly Read the entire proposal (not excerpts from those with an agenda) and I am sure you will see for yourself. You'll pick up what I am putting down, so to speak. I say good luck w/ it though (it makes for great donation gathering I suppose) but it won't go very far in my opinion.
@ButtyPretterfly Clinging to victomhood and the use of it as an 'action item response' suppresses ingenuity, creativity, &amp; innovation in my opinion. I don't like racial quotas, affirmative action, or tokenism either but that's just how I am.
@ButtyPretterfly The social justice provisions, the underlying message they are purporting with class struggles, the bs inequality statement they are clinging to regarding industries, &amp; their obvious issue w/ American exceptionalism, to name a few. There r underlying agendas below the surface.
@ButtyPretterfly Yeppers, clever huh? So many others but those two incidences were the two worst clinging to victomhood bs stories I could think of.

@foxnewsalert I just hope that future 'actual victims' of hate crimes aren't negatively affected by Jussie Smollet's antics. Maybe there will be a national moratorium to help stop fake, manufactured, &amp;/or staged fake hate crimes from happening.
Update on Jussie Smollett: He is under arrest. Besides making this a learning experience on a plethora of intermingling topics, let us not forget there are REAL victims of hate crimes who deserve our sympathy, thoughts, &amp; prayers. https://t.co/V7wgWKtkMt
@RepMaxineWaters Update: Jussie Smollett in police custody for 'allegedly' making the whole thing up. Besides making this a learning experience on a plethora of intermingling topics, let us not forget there are REAL victims of hate crimes who deserve our sympathy, thoughts, &amp; prayers.

@ericjgreene @bcenquirer There are 6+ million job openings (many are manufacturing jobs due to @POTUS policies) out there and the media landscape is oversaturated (undisputable). They'll be fine.

Reward @POTUS w/ more support &amp; less obstruction in Congress. The 'American Dream' is happening today w/ strong capitalist policies, business deregulation, workforce initiatives, etc championed by @POTUS &amp; the @GOP.

Putting emotions and @POTUS 's tone aside, his economic policies, judicial picks, law &amp; order stance, &amp; "America First" agenda should be supported by incoming Congressman for American safety &amp; prosperity. Its up to smart Americans to get those candidates elected to do just that. https://t.co/kE0KvIcwoz

Let's agree that civility should be a bipartisan agreement in political and personal engagements and disagreements. Ding, ding (Bell rings) - let the best common sense policies for American safety and prosperity win. #KAG #AmericaFirst #MAGA #GodBlessAmerica
When is civility in politics coming back? These types of threats need to stop. I fear 'real' violence is going to happen by a nutjob (ie Sen Scalise shooter) again. No one on either side should use it as political fodor. Have a political opinion, vote at ballot box, no violence. https://t.co/TzJtTmkOES
My associates and I believe political terrorism is terrible and should not be condoned, no matter what side it’s against. Congratulations to the skill and capability of American law enforcement agencies, in capturing the 'bomb' mailer. #BackTheBlue #KAG

@mitchellvii It's a possibility and may not be off the mark, time will tell. Nonetheless, scare tactics using mailed bombs, fake or not, are not appropriate ever. The CNN incident is definitely fishy, the other mailings interestingly timed, no matter who sent them! Just an opinion. #StayCivil

I'm confused. Why are people blaming Milo? Did the #Annapolis shooter get that text from Milo, I don't recall seeing his text in the news, past few days either?

@SenatorDurbin Ye No Comprende. Why? I thought America, Americans, &amp; the electoral college decided in 2016 after @POTUS won and the U.S. Senate had 51 Republican Senators. Hold on, let me read the U.S. Constitution and a few #Scotus rulings again...tick tock.. Hmmm, umm its a go to confirm asap

@brookefoxnews Excuse me but this is too simplified. There was so much more in the bill and some very important issues not in the bill that will be in it next time for passage (We all hope, I hope), but there are too many looking for a wedge issue to drum up donations &amp; make $ off of the issue.
Protect &amp; defend the U.S. Constitution: reminded at its inception it combined elements of wanting priveleged to help poorer individuals, self governance through a strong economic output &amp; patriotism. Look forward to a Constitutional originalist Supreme Court Justice nominee. #KAG
@W3dd1e So did @POTUS and I, great minds think alike, lol. #KAG
@TomSteyer It shouldn't be about hard-right or hard-left appointments, it should be about adhering to the US. Constitution and interpreting it as it was written &amp; the rule of law. Period. Have no doubt our Republic will flourish for the common good.
@EdKrassen Ummmm....didn't we just have an election in 2016? The American people and our political electorate has decided, young man. Expect 2 more fair and adherent Constitutionalists to be placed by @POTUS. #DontFret #GodIsGoodAllOfTheTime

@jaketapper Instead of stating "more aggressive immigration restrictions", it should read - more prudent common sense immigration restrictions &amp; vetting. Or maybe all the terrorists or those who wish to harm America will be dead/killed off &amp; no restrictions will be necessarily in future #KAG
@ShaunKing #IntellectualHonesty needed in your argument against this decision but I'm sure you will get a Pulitzer one day for your biased opinions one day, lol. The decision would've been 9-0 if not for activist judges. There was a rational basis &amp; only 8% of Muslim countries affected #KAG
@jbendery Their "full resolve and commitment" is simply to wrestle money from ignorant people who may think they are doing right &amp; may be emotionally tinged but don't understand the Constitution and the importance of keeping America safe (Never Forget 9/11) through Presidential powers #KAG
@harveyjkaye On constitutional basis, the decision should've been 9-0 on banning people from countries that don't have proper vetting mechanisms. On a side note, I'd take a Muslim who respects America &amp; its values over those causing chaos &amp; lamenting division any day. #AreYouDense #KAG #MAGA
@DaShanneStokes Many Muslims nations outside U.S not affected- 5 nations on ban out of how many others? If the countries had proper vetting mechanisms in place they wouldn't be on the list, one might imagine. Instead of causing division help those countries get there Sh!t together. #FactsMatter
@CyrusMMcQueen If you are still traumatized by that incident, you should go to a therapist, some might say. Instead, you should be reminded of 9/11 and what the decision may stop from happening in the future.... Remember "An ounce of prevention...", quote, in your supposed intellectual rhetoric

@Christie_D22 You didn't get the memo. The pictures of the kids literally in cages was from 2014. @POTUS has them in detention centers (not cages) for their protection from possible human traffickers, to do proper vetting &amp; health screening, etc. Perpetuating a lie is counterproductive. #KAG
There is a reason in this day &amp; age, America makes legal immigrant entrants take a 'citizen' test &amp; makes them learn our laws before becoming citizens.

@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Hey @RandPaul, you only got to 600 of the pages. I hope you keep breaking down the omnibus spending bill today. You never know, your colleagues might just read it through clearer eyes and see the err in in it before its too late.  Glad to see @POTUS has second thoughts about it.
5 scriptures for making decisions:	1. Luke 5:16	Tune out distractions		2. Proverbs 19:20	Seek godly advice		3. James 4:1	Narrow down your choices		4. James 1:22 	Do something		5. Psalm 28:7	 	Give glory to God, keep faith in Jesus Christ &amp; rejoice the Lord blessed us w/ @POTUS!
@realDonaldTrump Awesome idea @POTUS. Your constituents and supporters concur. I say, hallelujah, God is answering my prayers. The #MAGA and #AmericaFirst agendas shall overcome for the better good. Common sense wins again!
Support @RandPaul on omnibus. The U.S. benefits w/ balanced budgets, limited spending, less debt. Thr US Constitution says govt should "establish Justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, PROMOTE the general welfare, &amp; secure the Blessings of Liberty"! https://t.co/XbOiETmLsP
@RandPaul @RandPaul you rock. Thanks for breaking down the omnibus spending bill page by page...Gleefully waiting for the rest of your analysis.
Many House Republicans and Democrats have said they haven't had time to read the omnibus bill (many great appropriations but too many bad ones) in its entirety. I'm pretty sure many won't appreciate this. @GOP &amp; @POTUS is this an #AmericaFirst agenda item? https://t.co/eogkN1D2Tp

@dany_bahar @POTUS Hard data? The point I'm making is that they don't have the correct info to manufacture a correct report. "The truth shall set us free"... Wouldn't U like the correct info to formulate a concise &amp; proper policy to come to a correct summation? Let's agree, we disagree! Salud
@dany_bahar @POTUS I suggest this: As a start, so we are not anecdotal, you &amp; I go to detention centers, ask (w/ amnesty for forgone knowledge) how many crimes they know that other illegal immigrants have done that were never reported (drugs, hookin', assault, etc). You'll be surprised, I won't.
@dany_bahar Wouldn't take much of an investment in time (w/ a team scouring cities) &amp; very little $ to research. Don't disregard fact that an illegal immigrant is starting off as a criminal once they set foot on U.S. soil. After extrapolating the research you'll see a change is necessary.
@dany_bahar I know you're a #s guy, but as a son of a law enforcement professional (dad) &amp; mother (biker), not to mention 'real world' experience traveling in our great country all I can do is assure U, that is a fact. Time will tell, but the immigration reform proposed by @POTUS will help.

There is no telling what the job skills deficiency would be because we don't know who is in/coming to US &amp; what their skills are. Or do we? As a person who believes in my govt, I'm sure concerns would be managed.

@MattMurph24 What position is that- the founding of KKK, many voting against the Civil Rights Act in 60's, loading up Catholics to fight in Vietnam (hence a higher % of them dying in 'Nam), perpetuating a victim mentality in black community, not paying women the same as men, so much more.
@JonathanCohn Actually, they simply voted to get our government funded so that they could negotiate fixing DACA, getting immigration reform done by March. Isn't it sad that people need issues to campaign on rather than fix them. I expect #ImmigrationReform and a #DACA fix to happen by March!

Real issues: veterans suicides, opiod epidemic, disaster relief, crime, school choice, illegal immigration, wage equality, energy independence, sequestration, jobs, etc should matter more to so called #resist antagonizers than insulting @POTUS everyday. #MAGA let's pray for them!
@LizMorton4 @katfacebomb @Molly1Jo @paulkrugman @POTUS @GOP No comprende, senor!! ¿Por qué tiene que ser así?
@Molly1Jo @katfacebomb @paulkrugman @POTUS @GOP Your welcome Molly. Instead of MAGAT shouldn't it be MAGAIT (Making America Greater Again Is Terrific)! Remember- we all get more with honey than we do vinegar. Keep fighting the good fight for the better good. #XOXO
So much #FakeNews ("A type of yellow journalism or propaganda consisting of deliberate misinformation or hoaxes spread via traditional print &amp; broadcast news media or online social websites, etc."- Wikipedia) today. Let's avoid it, even in the name of comedy when possible. #MAGA
@rejectedpapers @laura_nelson "Transformative", could be cold-fusion energy plants, desalination plants, solarpower fields, waterboarding centers for terrorists (lol), prisons for Antifah members, space ships; re-education camps for socialists &amp; anarchists (lol j/k); transmission towers, etc #SkiesTheLimit
@Lee_in_Iowa @Molly1Jo Ummmm....the kids never lost their healthcare. "Can't we all just get along?", lol. Since it's obvious you don't have proper news sources, CHIP is popular w/ Republicans &amp; Democrats Lee. All #Schumer did was piss off servicemen, Vets, &amp; those effected by his antics. #RealTalk
@MattAsherS Since it is so hard to trust anyone on Twitter these days here is a Politico article that states Republicans &amp; Democrats support CHIP, not to mention you can get the roll call votes if U want to know 'the truth'. Support @POTUS policies #KnowledgeIsPower https://t.co/I1NQPU795s
@Molly1Jo @paulkrugman @POTUS @GOP By supporting sanctuary cities Democratic politicians are still "siding w/ illegals over our kids", but I digress. I'm an empathetic Hisp/Black/Caucasian/Native conservative. I don't mind DACA beneficiaries brought as kids staying, since this is the only country they've known.
@Molly1Jo @paulkrugman @POTUS @GOP https://t.co/I1NQPU795s via Politico. I don't see how they overplayed their hand on CHIP. The GOP did the right thing at the right time on CHIP &amp; was generous to make it a non issue for 6 year. @GOP &amp; @POTUS care about needy kids in America.
@crw555 @paulkrugman @POTUS @GOP "Republican and Democratic lawmakers have pledged to renew money for the popular bipartisan program." via Politico in Dec 21, 2017 article on CHIP, and it explains it was already funded til MARCH 2018!  So you may want to take your own advice &amp; #think, read &amp; get better informed
@nadalotta @paulkrugman @POTUS @GOP Oh, article was from Dec 21, 2017. "Republican and Democratic lawmakers have pledged to renew money for the popular bipartisan program." via Politico. You might want to follow my profile, I will not lead you astray. Oh and support @POTUS &amp; the #AmericaFirst agenda (It rocks)
@nadalotta @paulkrugman @POTUS @GOP https://t.co/I1NQPU795s via Politico
@paulkrugman Your "They took CHIP off the table" comments are as asinine as your "If the question is when markets will recover, a first-pass answer is 'never'," comments on @POTUS after the election. The @GOP was always going to vote yes on CHIP for poor kids. #DoYouEverGetSickOfBeingWrong
@MattAsherS #CHIP (Child Health Insurance Program) was never a bargaining chip and #ImmigrationReform was always going to happen. Twisting the facts may work for awhile but average voters are catching on. #Tryagain
@ezraklein Don't you mean America got 6 years of CHIP, which is a good program for needy American children. Conservatives aren't ashamed or upset at providing healthcare for poor children. Unlike peanut butter &amp; jelly, the govt budget ($) &amp; DACA (an empathetic policy) don't belong together.
@PalmerReport I disagree. Republicans support CHIP (health care for poor kids) and proved #Schumer merely wanted to placate to Hispanics. Empathetic policies, for all American citizens, especially kids runs deep in conservative circles. Democrats haven't cornered the market on compassion #MAGA
Is this fair @GOP &amp; @POTUS? - Law abiding DACA kids stay/possibility of citizenship, criminals deported; any chain migration by 'new citizens' limited to their kids &amp; spouse, a future merit based 'visa lottery type' system &amp; 'the wall' built, for national security. #MAGA #Empathy

But they are demoralized; they can smell what @POTUS is cookin'- a winning recipe of success in 2018 &amp; beyond!
"And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying,    Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace, goodwill toward men!” Luke 2:13-14! Keep #TheSpiritofChristmas this holiday season
@wjxt4 #Dispicable acts deserve contempt. Glad to hear the family ended up getting the issue resolved. Another reason that if you see something, say something or if you know something, say something.

Thank your Senators for passing the H.R. 1 #taxreform bill! https://t.co/GaVNpyS2IO So many great provisions in the bill I hurt my knee jumping up and down in jubilations. @POTUS, @GOP &amp; @FoxNews @MAGA
@nycsouthpaw Did you ask what does Affordable Health Care have to do with forced use of healthcare by everyone and a monetary penalty (another type of taxation) if you didn't get said insurance. #badpolicyisbadpolicy. #Taxreform &amp; energy independence will help make America more prosperous.
@mindyloudenver @727_555_1212 @RBReich @GOP @POTUS No comprende @mindyloudenver! Why are you so glum chum? If you take those hater glasses off you will see the benefits of soooo many policies, initiatives, and actions that @POTUS &amp; @GOP have already done for our entire country. #think #nobodyisperfect #keepanopenmind #MAGA
@727_555_1212 @RBReich #Denied, lol? Don't fret, potato chip. America the beautiful will flourish and prosper w/ #taxreform. Doubters will change their mind about this necessary legislation, one day. Expect the stock market to surge next week! Be hopeful @GOP &amp; @POTUS are #MAGA
@POTUS @GOP Senate #taxreform bill H.R. 1 that will now go to Senate/House negotiations passed on a 51 to 49 vote. Congrats to @GOP, @POTUS &amp; Dems for passing this monumental legislation. America will prosper I am sure of it. Keep #MAGA, one great policy at a time.
@POTUS @GOP Sen Merkley (D-OR) amendment to modify a provision that eliminates the excise tax in #TaxReform bill for colleges that forgo federal funding (doing so saves taxpayer $) for its students (ie Hillsdale College) passed by a 52-48 vote. Proper policy wins again.
@POTUS @GOP Sen Cantwell (D-WA) Amendment to H.R. 1, the Tax Reconciliation Act wanted to prevent ANWR oil &amp; gas drilling in Alaska. Didn't pass by a 52 - 48 vote. She might want to worry about getting her state's border secure instead of trying to stop our nation's energy independence goals
@POTUS @GOP Send Manchin Amendment to send #TaxReform bill back to committee to increase the corporate tax rate from the proposed 20% to 25% did not pass by a 68 - 38 vote. Many Dems voted against this amendment. #thankgoodness
@POTUS @GOP Sen Kaine amendment to remove alternative minimum tax (AMT) repeal from #TaxReform bill did not pass today. Vote was 66 - 34!
@POTUS @GOP Send Cruz Amendment on 529 Savings plan passed 51 - 50 (VP Pence cast deciding vote, since it was tied). It expands school choice by expanding the definition of the popular 529 College Savings Plans. Good stuff!!
@POTUS @GOP Sen Rubio's amendment to make the child tax credit apply to payroll taxes failed to pass today in Senate. Proper policy wins again.
@POTUS @GOP On C-SPAN2: Sen Brown's amendment #1854 to H.R.1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act doesn't pass.
@POTUS @GOP On C-Span2: Sanders Amendment has failed 54 - 46 but I doubt it was necessary anyways. @GOP is not going after Medicare and Social Security. Proper policy wins again.
52 - 48 to continue vote on Tax Bill. Amen....Now to the passage of any amendments and then #TaxReform. Stock market is going to boom on Monday I'm sure. @POTUS is keeping America winning. #MAGA https://t.co/4gOeL08dms
Final vote on #TaxReform bill will begin shortly. Contact Senators in support of the bill. It may not be perfect but it has many elements that will help America prosper. Thank you @POTUS, @GOP &amp; Dems for a job well done. https://t.co/6Jcd6oDLlb

@JonnyTorres @GOP As in political analysis &amp; policy, looking at homeownership in the prism of a businessperson may do you well in the Trump era, sir. #MAGA
@JonnyTorres @GOP @JonnyTorres Ppl should prioritize finances to buy homes instead of buying into fads, music, clubbing, etc; Rent instead of own a home, lol?
@JonnyTorres @GOP Benefit of rent?: Lower housing costs (not an investment in self), Short-term commitment (ie gamophobia) No/minimal maintenance/repair costs

@JonnyTorres @GOP Not to mention all of the goods &amp; services associated w/ home building, ownership, maintenance. @JonnyTorres, I disagree w/ your assessment
@JonnyTorres @GOP Homes increase in value, build equity &amp; nest eggs for future. More stable than renting (mortgage). Int/prop tax of mortgage is tax deduction
@JonnyTorres @GOP Stability comes w/ entrepreneurship &amp; hardwork, ppl prioritize finances to own a home, homeownership brings stability &amp; love for community.
