@indignant_sepoy @benshapiro She is scared to debate him. No matter what cartoon or comic strip you post. She was obviously flustered by the ridicule she received. Hence her "im the boss" comments. She couldnt handle a debate with Ben . You and all libs know it. #leftisttearshotorcold
@indignant_sepoy @benshapiro Dems constantly talk about war time prosperity (i.e. ww2) and if you listened to his show you would understand the joke . But instead you view ben as an idiot so why would you care about the reality of what he says. Doesnt fit with your world view. Typical of todays politics.D&amp;R.
@indignant_sepoy @benshapiro Are you seriously talking about intellect while defending AOC? This is a joke about her calling her plan ambitious.  When in reality it is stupid.

@EMarieHoward2 @MichelleThies1 @JoshStein_ I dont care if you use it to make jewelry.  Why should i have to pay for it is the question you cant answer.
@EMarieHoward2 @MichelleThies1 @JoshStein_ Not sure i understand this question. If i pay for my own shit then i get to recieve my own shit. Is kinda the logic im going on here. I understand insurance companies cover more people than me driving down the cost. But adding people they have to pay for make it more expensive.

@BillKristol You would say anything at this point.
@JoshStein_ Yes, their own . Including how to pay for it. If they cant afford it thats a dilemma for them. It in no way says that i, as an employer should have to pay for it. If i want to incentivise women i can offer that. But the gov shouldnt force me(really my customers) to pay for that.

@HammerDelFuego @HillaryClinton Nailed it
@HillaryClinton Are you kidding? I guess your time in the Obama administration is just a blur or something. Look in a mirror, then crawl in a hole and stfu. Im not in favor of this choice of trumps. But im damn sure not  gonna take foriegn policy advice for you.#goaway
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Yup showing the nation you &amp; your colleagues lack of backbone on immigration, because u are too afraid of offending or seeming cold hearted to foreigners. So you completely ignore "Americans " concerns about border security. You guys are not just anti trump you're anti American .
@tedlieu @POTUS Ummm. Sitting president ,head of DOJ. vs ex president no longer in charge of DOJ. Thats the major difference. But since we are playing whataboutism, then trump is just having "casual" meetings with Whitaker.  So dont worry. Just talking grankids ,you know.
@KamalaHarris Do it then. Give him 5 billion and lets move on. Problem is avoiding any trump victory is your only cause. Please just come outand say it. And spare us all your subtlety.
@CreativeTrish2 @kwn1170 @Dolores08406520 @GovRonDeSantis @realDonaldTrump Guess i missed that one. Ill look it up
@MarkRey92717108 @GovRonDeSantis @realDonaldTrump Ports of entry are the front door i was describing in my earlier post.quick question. Why do you think border crossings are down?

@kwn1170 @MarkRey92717108 @GovRonDeSantis @realDonaldTrump "Bozo trumpanzee" cute. You obviously dont know me. This is about a needed wall. Something we have been needing and something we will continue to need no matter who is President.  I didnt vote for trump btw. Fucking libtard
@Dolores08406520 @GovRonDeSantis @realDonaldTrump What was that?
@MarkRey92717108 @GovRonDeSantis @realDonaldTrump Right.... because a wall denies asylum claims. Lol they still have a way in . Just not through the back door. Want asylum, apply for it. Dont just cross the border.
@Vickigr81567276 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Good to know from someone on the grd floor
@Vickigr81567276 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump The figure i gave you of 3 trillion also wasnt factoring in sales tax so still holds true on that one. As for your occupational statement, have you ever incountered the use of a fake or stolen SS# to attain benefits?
@Vickigr81567276 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump So i  did the research myself. You were partially correct. They do pay an est 7 bil of the 3 trillon collected every year. So around 1%. Yet they make up around 25% of the pop. In your state and mine. If they all paid id be fine with them coming. Its Just not the case.

I do see the pooling together as a benifit though.
@nickdoesmyhair @Emelle @yashar @mugrogue Just want to note that things like insurance are done on a "pool together" price structure. Thats why large corporations have better plans(usually) than smaller. Simple numbers. What we need to push the gov to allow is us to pool in other groups ,such as churches,clubs etc.

@BrandonOmara @rbeinstein @ReggieBush Nice ,good luck to you there. I hope you find a privilege all your own there

@BrandonOmara @rbeinstein @ReggieBush When people say things about groups of people who neither represent me I'm not privileged nor are you oppressed by that
@BrandonOmara @rbeinstein @ReggieBush Would suddenly start bashing it for oppression.
@BrandonOmara @rbeinstein @ReggieBush We have completely missed each other obviously . I do find it amusing how someone who found this country acceptable since he was 10
@BrandonOmara @rbeinstein @ReggieBush What you said
@BrandonOmara @rbeinstein @ReggieBush You saying not part of the community ...aka not black . "So you can't understand the context " this is the example you asked for look at
@BrandonOmara @rbeinstein @ReggieBush Now I'm oppressing you.ha https://t.co/JzddyUq8LR
@BrandonOmara @rbeinstein @ReggieBush Saying I'm not of the community and not of the movement . So I'm not black nor BLM......this is what I mean .
@BrandonOmara @rbeinstein @ReggieBush Tell me again what system is against you and for me. I'll wait. Don't just say oppression prove it. Don't insult truth
@BrandonOmara @rbeinstein @ReggieBush Like I originally said you use race like a club to gavel  down white who oppose your view. Enough said .
@BrandonOmara @rbeinstein @ReggieBush I like how we tell an entire generation of people that if they don't succeed in life ,it's not because of choices but of white privilage
@BrandonOmara @rbeinstein @ReggieBush Is in my favor . Me specifically and a specific system that is set up to help me and oppress you
@BrandonOmara @rbeinstein @ReggieBush My quote erlier about white wasn't a direct quote but a quote from the common "white privilage" narrative. Will you point out how society
@BrandonOmara @rbeinstein @ReggieBush Troll? Ha . Just like to see facts given not broad generalizations
@BrandonOmara @rbeinstein @ReggieBush "Of the community " the implication. Here is that his voice was being stifled with the club of victimhood
@BrandonOmara @rbeinstein @ReggieBush  https://t.co/r3DPs8L17A
@BrandonOmara @rbeinstein @ReggieBush And what I mean is when you say all cops . It makes those affected by it upset with all cops and not those responsible.
@BrandonOmara @rbeinstein @ReggieBush Push. For it has impact on other innocent lives . I.e. Dallas shooting
@BrandonOmara @rbeinstein @ReggieBush I think the bigger picture is that all grow to understand there are problems with race and police . We just must be careful the narrative we
@BrandonOmara @rbeinstein @ReggieBush Skin color is silly. I'm not black I don't see the world from that perspective but I do do understand the facts and know both blacks and cop
@BrandonOmara @rbeinstein @ReggieBush Yes I understand police brutality and have seen it cross racial lines disgracefully. To think my level of understanding is lessened by
@BrandonOmara @rbeinstein @ReggieBush Is a copout
@BrandonOmara @rbeinstein @ReggieBush The point I'm making is the merit of an argument is not determined by level of victimhood . Saying "you're white so you don't understand"
@BrandonOmara @rbeinstein @ReggieBush I do understand the difference even though I didn't correct it . Don't discredit the argument over a typo
@BrandonOmara @rbeinstein @ReggieBush That's a first. Lol
@BrandonOmara @rbeinstein @ReggieBush The "your white so the merit of your argument is not as superior as mine which is enshrined in my racial victimhood. " argument
@BrandonOmara @rbeinstein @ReggieBush Then name them and stop saying cops. If I said blacks but I just meant a small group that would be unfair the rest of blacks .#Becon sistant
@ReggieBush We have problems .cops need more training but saying it's ok to be a bigot if it's your bigot seems hypocritical .
@emiliHEYo @ReggieBush Lol
@ReggieBush Is this the logic =excuse calling "all " cops pigs while at the same time condemning a view that   "all " blacks are dangerous? #Hypocrite
@QBs_Nightmare @ReggieBush "Where I grew up" sure sounds like a place . All the Black people I grew up with call the cops. So your logic doesn't stick.
