Top reasons for Bannon's betrayal:		1) That guy was his evil twin brother George. The real Steve Bannon is locked up in a basement somewhere.		2) He's broke and someone promised him a big payday.		3) After he lost his job he also lost his mind.		#TrumpBannon
@CassandraRules In the Christian church calendar it's still the Christmas season so until Epiphany (Three Kings), which is this Sunday.
@KatyTurNBC So you're just going to believe and report on every single thing written in this book as the gospel truth, even after those quoted in the book have said they never said the things attributed to them? Or those w first hand knowledge dispute it? This includes your messiah Obama.

@Cernovich The whole thing is very strange and unfortunate. But remember what Scaramucci said about Bannon last summer? He obviously knew something.

@brianstelter @davidfrum Is it a coincidence that all the incorrect stories are anti-Trump? MSM is either so blinded by bias that they imagine things that aren't there, or doing it on purpose in desperate attempt to take him down even if your own credibility takes a hit. So tell us, which one is it?
There are 2 explanations for the increase in fake news by the MSM:		1. They're getting so desperate to take down Trump that they will willingly take a credibility hit.		2. They're so blinded by their bias and hatred that they're literally imagining things that aren't there.
