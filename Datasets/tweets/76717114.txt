@DonaldJTrumpJr Kid, I doubt you’re re competent enough to dissect a worm, never mind anything complicated. You can chop up something, yes: Dissect it, no. After all, it takes brains and knowledge and experience to dissect (vs. chop up) something and then better understand it’s intricacies.
@ewarren RIGHT ON, Liz!
@seanhannity @jsolomonReports Has anyone told you that you appear to be delusional regarding your sense of self importance and ignorant of the astounding depth of your own narrow minded, self-imposed ignorance? Or are you simply another amoral Trumpian sycophant?
@GOP @FLOTUS When it comes to providing REAL “comfort” to children, sweetheart, how ‘bout getting the 100s of kids and babies out of your husband’s children’s prisons on the border? Or are you just as much a transparent pr hound and fraud as he is?
@realDonaldTrump ...just because you say these outrageous things makes them any truer than the 1100+ other, well-documented lies you’ve psychotically told us as President. Facts, Donald, are FACTS. Truths is TRUTH: concepts you appear unable to grasp (like so many others).
@realDonaldTrump Have you ever considered committing yourself to truthfulness?
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump Dear Ding-ding: Getting wasted $$$s back from one disaster to just misuse it on another is not progress.
@VP @POTUS Smarmy is as smarmy does. You &amp; D.C. GOP are repulsively sycophantic. Some are dumb, I guess; but most are simply selling their sorry souls to hang onto their titles, social standing, office perks &amp; power, with not a patriot among them. Our WWI&amp;II, K&amp;VN soldiers died for this?!??
@VP @POTUS Most informed citizens want to see “America lead” YOU permanently into outer space (or inner space, i.e. prison) for dereliction of duty, divulging U.S. secrets to our enemies, money laundering, spewing rivers of lies, propaganda, and racist drivel, etc. ”As YOU say, “SICK”!

@DonaldJTrumpJr Don’t you have any actual WORK to do other than tweeting? You’re the PRESIDENT for god’s sake!
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Mr. Trump, the world’s number one Putinite, is once again doing his level best to undermine the free world economy so as to benefit his mentor. No surprises here...just more erosion of U.S. VALUES, STRENGTH, COMPETENCY, AND ALLIANCES! Disgusting, SCARY, and utterly reprehensible.
@thehill Trump is precisely the type individual I want my children to never emulate, appreciate, or tolerate. Such ignorance, vapid social skills, bullying, and egotistical arrogance makes him the hero of fools, the bane of a civilization’s advancement, and an embarrassment to the nation.
@realDonaldTrump Putinites (like yourself?) and oligarchs like the Koch brothers etc., who are heavily invested in (and obscenely profit from) antiquated gas, coal, and oil infrastructure know (or care about) what is and is not “brilliant”? Is that what you say, sir? You and your ilk? Geniuses?
@realDonaldTrump Responsibly regulated CAPITALISM is NOT socialism: It IS the application of logic, common sense, and human decency to improve a nation’s overall productivity, creativity, and quality of life. Both unregulated capitalism AND radical socialism create the antithesis of this. Period.

@thehill Yes, but Churchill was not mentally out-to-lunch. His brain WORKED and he USED IT to develop and implement a strategy to attract allies and win a world war. Trump can’t even develop a strategy to get a useless wall built.
@newtgingrich Trump is no Winston Churchill. Churchill had a brain and used it to orchestrate a strategy to attract allies and win a world war! Churchill wrote his own books, a lot of them. Trump has yet to master sentence structure and simple spelling.
@yashar @KellyannePolls Scoop #1: He was thrown out of his job.  Scoop #2: That’s not bad, that’s great! When’s our pussy-grabbing president going to be thrown out of his by his pathetic supporters such as your duplicitous self and GOP clowns in Congress?

@Jedidiahman @senatemajldr Actually, walls didn’t, don’t and won’t work. Gunners every few hundred feet might - walls, not so much. Tunnels, boats, planes, bribed drivers, ladders, grappling hooks, sledge hammers &amp; chisels, pole vaulting (lol), etc.
@The_Jim_Martin @SherrodBrown Everyone knows Maginot wasn’t a wall! The POINT IS: the longer the barrier, the worse it works. Countless people escape prison walls, same w/ Berlin Wall . They go/went over, under, and around it - by land, sea, and air! Machine gunners every few hundred feet worked, wall didn’t.
@LAMOONLYNN @senatemajldr Nothing is dependable  “everywhere”...except stupidity. Unfortunately, there’s no shortage of it amongst supporters of absurdly wasteful and ineffective proposals of their like-minded “heroes”.
@SpeakerPelosi Not one $ for the wall and kill his proposal re Medicare. We are PROUDof you, Nancy! Keep pursuing this and investigating this administration’s corruption and betrayal of America and our values as a country of immigrants!
@SenKevinCramer You’re kidding, right? Either that or you’re delusional...or as wacky as a cat on catnip! What sort of screwballs vote your ill into office must really WANT world chaos or war. I s’pose you love Trump, Putin, and Kim, too?
@senatemajldr You and your pal Trump have finally convinced me to never vote Republican again no matter who they appear to be or say they support. Sick, spineless, greed driven, power drunk, evil geniuses, the lot of you.
@washingtonpost SOS...SOS!!! “Genius” unaware China’s Great Wall failed to block invaders and again demands 7th century “solution” to 21st century issue. Intergalactic aliens, dumbfounded by President’s unique form of “logic”, agree to bypass sharing tech knowledge with dysfunctional Earthlings.

Your acts are Shameful, Sad, Despicable. Your acts are those of a weak, thoughtless, greed driven, power-drunk, childish brat.
@SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Centuries ago China’s Great Wall failed to block invaders though manned by more troops than we have in our ENTIRE Marine Corp! Berlin Wall? Failed, gone. Even the famed Maginot Line failed...walls are NOT the solution. NOT A DIME FOR NEW WALL CONSTRUCTION...idiotic waste of $$$.!
@The_Jim_Martin @SherrodBrown You’re really this simpleminded? Build goofy walls the Chinese PROVED failed a millennium ago while manned by more armed soldiers than in our ENTIRE Marine Corp! For the love of God: THINK...and read a little history. Great Wall-FAILED. Berlin Wall-FAILED. Maginot Line? Ha!
@SherrodBrown Not a nickel for the wall!
@ChuckGrassley @realDonaldTrump Not a dime for the wall! China’s Great Wall FAILED to block *armed* invaders CENTURIES ago. Is this difficult for you to grasp? The Berlin Wall: Gone-failed. The Maginot Line?  Gone-failed. Geez..read history. This shutdown is YOUR FAULT. And we won’t forget in November’s ahead
@senatemajldr Duhhh... how ‘bout China’s 7th century Great Wall that didn’t work while manned by more soldiers than in the Marines! Is this difficult for you or Trump to grasp? The Berlin Wall? Gone-failed. The Maginot Line?  Gone-failed. The Great Wall-failed, except as a tourist trap. Geez..
@senatemajldr China’s 7th century Great Wall didn’t work though manned by more soldiers than in the U. S. Army! Is this difficult for you or Trump to grasp? The Berlin Wall? Gone-failed. The Maginot Line?  Gone-failed. The Great Wall-failed and now a tourist trap. Geez..read history! Man up.

@hovest_tina @SpeakerPelosi @SenateGOP Only someone with no knowledge of the FAILURE CENTURIES ago and of the Maginot Line in the last centur to block bar invaders. China’s wall was guarded by more soldiers than there are voters in several states! And “geniuses” want BILLIONS to replicate them? Why? They FAIL to work.
@SpeakerPelosi @SenateGOP China’s 20ft-thick Great Wall FAILED to bar invaders CENTURIES ago...all while guarded by more soldiers than there are voters in several states! Self-declared “geniuses” want BILLIONS to replicate it? Are they TRYING to undermine/cripple U.S. governmnt effectiveness for Vlad?

@EricTrump @LaraLeaTrump Lara's right! Incredibly important midterms! If we vote this idiot president's supporters back into office, we may soon all have to learn how to speak Russian or Korean!

I'll give Fox this though: It IS foxy...and has every dopey, lazy, misguided or greedy person in the U.S. under its Baghdad Bob-like spell of repetitious lies, distortions, and fear mongering.
@realDonaldTrump More people are slaughtered by each other in one city, Chicago, in a year than were in ALL terrorist acts throughout the ENTIRE USA in the past TEN years! You ignorant, stupid, fear mongering, maniacal, self-obsessed MORON! Sec. Tillotson labelled you right. You ARE a MORON.
@VP @POTUS You really think we're ALL stupid? We know where/when and by whom the foundation for this recovery was laid. You have betrayed our allies and our people, crawled into bed with Russia, backed out of our international treaties/trade deals, insulted China. Wait, see what's AHEAD.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Ah, my favorite propagandist channel...Baghdad Bob now works there, right? Oh, no, I think he has gone toes up somewhere. He'd be great on Fox and Friends. Fit right in. Give a warm room, a toiled and a couple grand a month and he, too, will say anything...lol.
@IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Personally, I'd like to declare war on his mouth. Does he EVER shut up...or tell the truth about anything -- even to you?
@KellyannePolls @POTUS When your grand kids start dying of food poisoning, lead poisoning, airplanes that fall out of the sky, exploding cookies, peanut butter laced with rat droppings, and your acid bleached hair falls out, get back to me and lemme know whatcha think of all this "progress" then.
@realDonaldTrump I have a dog that wags its tail when it barks. One day I held its tail still and it stopped barking. Now...Mr. Trump's tiny tiny hands, do you think if we held them still that ...
Other than that, she's wonderful, in a satanic sorta way she's sort of adorable. I disagree with those who say she's like an ugly rabid rat. It is course and unacceptable to say such things or to say she is a lying, thieving, weasel. I would never say such things about anyone...
@Dawn88009046 @nytimes You really think we are going to HAVE descendants, after this guy? You wild-eyed optimist, you!
@GuppieShark @nytimes Russia is a lovely place. 98% of Russians, the Kremlin says, are happy and voted for Mr. Putin. 33% of Americans were unhappy and voted for Mr. Trump who aims to make Americans as happy as Russians and expects to garner 98% of the vote next time...once he gets control of the DOJ.
@Elvis88697556 @Stephenboyce @GovWalker @POTUS @WCTC @IvankaTrump @SecretaryAcosta Please do it quietly and with respect...
@Elvis88697556 @GovWalker @IvankaTrump @POTUS @WCTC @SecretaryAcosta God spelled backwards is dog. It is! and I LOVE my dog and God, but haven't a clue about the True nature of my relationship with either, other than to say, we get along and that neither I or my dog have words adequate to explain our "relationship" to each other, never mind God.
@JamieCh08997164 @SenSanders Yes, Venezuela is lovely. So is Russia...and, fortunately, if we give this lunatic enough rope, he'll have us living just like folks there do...and won't that just be wonderful, wonderful.
@Getagripdotcom @CharlesBenson4 @IvankaTrump @GovWalker The only shield that should exist here is the one her grandpa should have worn a long long time ago...if you get my drift. This guy uses...uses...everybody, including every relatively unsophisticated American voter he can manipulate via fear mongering, lying, and race baiting.
@JeffreyGuterman @JoyceCarolOates @realDonaldTrump Checks? I don't think he's encounter reality, never mind checks! But I get your drift...😕
@DorightDonna @NeilMS17 @CharlesBenson4 @IvankaTrump @GovWalker Exposed??? I don't do that sort of thing. I leave it up to the likes of our ... er ... your president, who appears to also like "grabbing" certain things, which I also don't do.
@Mobettastone @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Winning what? Votes as the most corrupt, traitorous, middle class crushing, healthcare-denying, child welfare-ignoring, lie encapsulated, idiotic administration in the history of the country wherein a president thinks he's King? Oh, and wha' happened to post card tax returns. LOL
@2shoetoby @YoungDems4Trump @realDonaldTrump I am utterly opposed to assassination and all sort of violence, nevertheless, this does not prevent me from peacefully wishing that a number of people would grace the country and the planet by leaving it before they get around to destroying it. But, hey, that's just me...
@ILoveSlaw @beachteach56 @YoungDems4Trump @realDonaldTrump Bullets, guns...hey, you think too small! Get on board with the King in the White House who makes the point: "What good's having nuclear bombs if we don't use 'em." Brilliant! Brilliance of the highest GOP order. Who knows, maybe he'll set one off on the White House lawn?
@beachteach56 @YoungDems4Trump @realDonaldTrump The only person I threaten is myself: One more year of this goofy president and I'll start wishing on a star for the return to office of that other venerable GOP leader and genius - Georgie Bush, who, by the way, thinks Trump is nut...lol. You just can't make this stuff up!
@ILoveSlaw @beachteach56 @YoungDems4Trump @realDonaldTrump No, sir! I say more GUNS, Guns, by God, for EVERYONE but no bullets or powder.

@CNN Won’t this be grand. I wonder how many more millions of Americans will be pushed off healthcare to pay for it...
@foxandfriends @ajtata If that’s a question, FoxNews is the answer! It’s a goofy collection of ill informed posers whose level of actual or willful historical ignorance is breath-taking, outdone only by their obliviousness to any notion of its depth &amp; breadth...I shall pray for you to read...and THINK.
@seanhannity Please stop disgracing yourself ...and Christianity. When your kind meet a down and outer, you kick him and connive to deny him healthcare...and food. Just like Jesus would, right, Mr. Insanity? Yuck. You make me nauseous.

@realDonaldTrump You didn't say you're a draft dodging coward of a "civilian"? Everything about you is small: Hands, brain, conscience, courage,.
@Education4Libs Our Pussy-Grabber-&amp;-Chief can talk about NOTHING since has neither a brain, conscience, or grasp of either facts or science. SILENCE please!
@realDonaldTrump Tell me in 6 mo.. We know how this goes; guns light up again in 3 months, or You &amp; Vlad partition Syria to give Vlad what he wants of it.
@realDonaldTrump I often wonder if you've been exiled here from Planets Stupidity or Prepubescence after having gone bankrupt too many times on Planet Greed.
@realDonaldTrump Dear Pussy-Grabber-and-Chief: WRONG AGAIN! As a journalist, retired, I don't want her OR you. America needs civil, brilliant, kind leaders!
@seanhannity Good point; but not THE point today as a pussy-grabbing, fact &amp; reality denying, self contradicting lunatic wreaks U.S. &amp; world havoc!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Well, me boyo, you're your father's son all right: arrogant, angry, loud mouthed, obfuscatory, fact-challenged, &amp; remarkably ignorant. SHUSH
@SpeakerRyan Oh, you'll fix it all righty, you'll put the "fix" in so the social and civil foundations of our country collapse and misery rules the land.
@realDonaldTrump This is called propaganda, unlike science, which you call propaganda, that is fact. You seem to get EVERYTHING ass-backwards.
@realDonaldTrump Dear pussy-grabber-and-chief, asking one's child to hold one's seat is prosecutable! Hopefully you, at least, had your pants on this time?
@DonaldJTrumpJr @nypost A lying, thieving, propagandizing, fact &amp; science denying, wife cheating, pussy grabbing, tax &amp; draft dodging, retarded brat as Prez; yawn?
@seanhannity Please, Mr. Self-proclaimed hero of the down trodden. We're not all as stupid as you hope.
@seanhannity You're correct: You don't deserve awards...other than as being part of a twisted propaganda machine denying single payer healthcare for all.
@seanhannity You &amp; other Koch pawns are destroying healthcare for millions &amp; back redirecting healthcare funds to the 1% in the form of tax breaks. Sick!
@HouseGOP Ya, by torpedoing healthcare for all and giving the wealthiest Americans the unspent healthcare funds. Creepy, conniving, crooked thinking!
@seanhannity @BretStephensNYT @nytimes Perhaps you might like to actually try to think for yourself now &amp; then rather than regurgitating GOP talking points. Medicare for ALL...NOW
@SpeakerRyan You'd have to drag me kicking &amp; screaming to get me into the same room with either of you, never mind voluntarily "joining" you? I know.
@GOP Is it true that many GOP leaders are potheads baffled by basic math...but expert at lunacy driven hyperbole?
@seanhannity @POTUS Pot should be avoided by editorialists, Sean.
@SenateGOP Thank GOP "leaders" for purposely destroying Obamacare's financial underpinnings. They succeeded! Yay! Now *you* get to pay the price.
@SpeakerRyan And to do it you'll throw America's elderly, sick &amp; disabled under a bus by undermining Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security &amp; Obamacare.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Well, you certainly can't be challenged as an authority on biases, young man.
@SpeakerRyan So you'll kill healthcare for millions of them and transfer the $$$s "saved" to corporations &amp; the nation's wealthiest families! SICK. Evil.
@SpeakerRyan Yes! Here's an idea: Cancel  healthcare to millions of Americans and give the money "saved" to the wealthy via even more tax breaks. Genius!
@SpeakerRyan Uh- huh. Sure...
@dmartosko Trump certainly BELONGS in a lineup.
@dantherriault @JoyceCarolOates 30% of voters should let immigrants vote for them. Like Trump, 30% are ignorant of facts, economics, world events, gov't &amp; U.S. history!

@AGENT_GATTACA @DonaldJTrumpJr @Project_Veritas I'm not sad. Are you sad? If you are, that IS sad...but not for me. Trump's delusionary antics keep me marvelously entertained and laughing!

@realDonaldTrump ROFL
@realDonaldTrump We must immediately BAN all Chicagoans from migrating to other U.S. cities. Killers hiding among those fleeing the violence threaten us all!
@SpeakerRyan Ya, and then screw 'em all...and their families...by undermining healthcare, schools, and efforts to clean up our air, water, &amp; food chain.
@realDonaldTrump You, sir, are a GENIUS, an idiot savant, one might say, of stupidity, greed &amp; abuse of office. You are, in fact, truly "GREAT" at it! ROFL

@realDonaldTrump The BEST PART was NOT seeing you.
@realDonaldTrump Apparently you can't do ANYTHING. 1,000 jobs LOST at Carrier, ALL Ford Focus mfg. OVER in USA...100% to be built in China! "GREAT?" "WINS?"
@realDonaldTrump Obama's coat tail job increases prove otherwise...while your approaches lost 1,000 Carrier jobs and Ford building ALL Focus cars in China!
@DonaldJTrumpJr You yap more and say less of meaning than my puppy...lol.

@SenateMajLdr It'll be happy only when people get smart enough to throw you out of office for betraying your oath of office and the country. Shame, shame.

@IngrahamAngle @DonaldJTrumpJr You are pathetic...
@SenateMajLdr Thanks to your dogged undermine of the initial plan, you deceitful, lying, weasel.

@realDonaldTrump The only bleeding going on is in your Swiss cheese-like brain.

@herdyshepherd1 These cattle are hiding in an effort to avoid the stomach turning eventuality of being exposed to a stomach-turning glimpse of Donald Trump.
@DonaldJTrumpJr You and your father are pitiably pathetic, ignorant, untrustworthy (ask 1,000 Carrier workers now being fired!), and genuinely repulsive.
@realDonaldTrump I don't want to hear anymore lies like you told 1,000 Carrier workers! All are now losing their jobs. 500 two days before Christmas. Liar.
@realDonaldTrump Go away...please. Just get out. Leave.
@SenateMajLdr @WhiteHouse And who, might I ask, worked so hard to insure it would collapse. You're slick...but you day will come and the public will have your hide.

@CNN I'd describe Trump in derogatorily, if I could find words to express my indescribably low opinion of his intellect, morality, or patriotism.
@CNN @CillizzaCNN Odd...she LOOKS like exactly what she IS.

@politico Trump, oddly,  looks exactly like what he is. Fitting, don't you think?
@CNN Heartbreaking beyond words...too awful for words...his poor family. Our hearts go out to them as they struggle with all this.
@washingtonpost Trump's the kid who steals another's A+ term paper, submits it as his own, then gleefully watches the kid get an F.
@danielsmilowitz @HuffingtonPost So you would support appointing a rapist as justice because otherwise Trump would nominate a pedophile?
@HuffingtonPost This guy's a mindless automaton, as all strict constructionists are. A computer can dispense thoughtless "justice".
@politico Bagdab Bob strikes again.
@realDonaldTrump Not ur doing. Been in works 4 years! You're like a kid who steals another's test answers and submits em as his own. Loser!
@realDonaldTrump Aren't you wonderful.
@mitchellvii @realDonaldTrump Yep, he sure is almost freaky. You got that right.
@realDonaldTrump We are closing in on something you appear to hate and that is, in this case very very ugly: The Truth. :-)
@realDonaldTrump Gee, nice to see you have your money launderer as your right hand man right there with you.
@realDonaldTrump Oh, really? Like not covering ER visits, maternity costs, hospitalization, and and and...disgusting!

@POTUS Either the news is fake or Trump is fit to be President is.
@POTUS Don't mess with Medicare in any way. We want single payer healthcare NOW to kill huge WASTE of countless insurance hierarchies.

@SenSanders   You bet your last nickel we do! Go Bernie, go!
@realDonaldTrump I agree! They either disagree with you or do a "great" job of showing how incompetent and unqualified they are. CONGRATS!
@realDonaldTrump    She lost because she had the balls to standup to Putin. Hers apparently are bigger than yours...
@realDonaldTrump    With a little luck, so will you.
@SenSanders     Go Bernie, go. This incoming regime is truly murderous and God help its victims.
@realDonaldTrump @LBPerfectMaine    NEVER will I again BUY ANYTHING FOR ANYONE - EVER from L.L. BEAN!
@realDonaldTrump   Loser...

@POTUS @NASA @MarsCuriosity   Please don't leave! How're we s'posed to sleep with this miscreant's tweety fingers twitching over The Button?
@realDonaldTrump @CNN      The ratings that are plummeting aren't CNN's but yours, the worst in history for any president elect. LOSER.
@realDonaldTrump   There was a lot of flakey dialog flung around there, but the amateur actors on stage did the best faking they could.
@NewYorker  Let's not waste time. Time is precious: Let's impeach him before he's inaugurated. Please...
@realDonaldTrump    Duhhh...you just won some electoral college votes, but LOST the peoples' vote and have less than a 37% approval rating!

@realDonaldTrump Most of us do not believe everything Russia "says"...LOL
@realDonaldTrump "No nothing" is a double negative, which, of course, is a positive admission that you are lying...as most genuine LOSERS do
@realDonaldTrump You LOST the popular vote and your approval is down to 37%...you are a LOSER, and it shows.
@realDonaldTrump One giggles at the shear juvenileness of a bully whining about "unfair" when he someone pulls his pants down...lol. Great!
@realDonaldTrump "Sad, so sad..." that you are, perhaps, getting some of your own smear tactics hurled back at you. Fitting...for a loser.
@realDonaldTrump DUNNO, BUT YOU'VE BEEN DOING A GREAT JOB OF MAKING THE U.S. INTO SOMETHING SIMILAR.  LOSER
@realDonaldTrump ME THINKEST THOU PROTESTETH TOO VIGOROUSLY...

@EricTrump @realDonaldTrump @LaraLeaTrump I wish you well as people...but fear the hell out of you when it comes to leading a nation.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump God help us.
@realDonaldTrump Not more than once?
@realDonaldTrump China needs a little squeezing on a lot of things...but you'd better be ready for a tsunami if you squeeze the wrong thing.
@realDonaldTrump @DanScavino LOL...you're kidding, right? The garbage occasionally get picked up in NYC, wanna take credit for that, too?
@realDonaldTrump So far, you've delivered the "0" jobs your right hand is illustrating. It appears your body is exposing your duplicity?
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Hannity has turnips for brains (my apologies to turnips). Assange...really, Donnie, really? What sandbox r u in?
@realDonaldTrump Yep, ur right on this...and then the entire healthcare system collapse is going to fall right on top of you, old boy. Chess
@realDonaldTrump If chess is too hard, try domino toppling. Think like a second grader, they at least get cause-effect consequences.
@realDonaldTrump You know as much about computer forensics as you do about governing. Good luck, Charlie, you're gonna NEED it. Poser.
@realDonaldTrump You need to see a shrink.
@realDonaldTrump Which of the huge financial interests your family has in Russia will Putin use to pull your presidential strings? Ouch...!
@realDonaldTrump Yessir, once Putin takes over the entire Baltic, perhaps Turkey, and overruns western Europe the world will be wonderful.
@realDonaldTrump ...as long as you do what Putin tells you, yep. But, brother mine, what'll your pal do when you DON'T?
@realDonaldTrump @MeetThePress @chucktodd Donnie, the press is not obligated to disseminate disinformation or propaganda...duhhh.

@realDonaldTrump You need serious psychiatric help.
@realDonaldTrump Duuhh... Ford made that decision long before you were a twinkle in the eye of the electorate, who elected Hillary, not you.
@realDonaldTrump As Putin's Puppet President...who cares or believes a THING you say about anything?
Lie down with dogs, wake up with fleas: Guess who Trump's national security advisor met up with? https://t.co/O9AqmrxkWm
Guess Who: She smiles like an innocent, loving grandma and lies like the bloody devil.
Isn't it odd that each of them look exactly like what they are?
Guess who: He's like a fighter who won 14 rounds, then punched himself in the head and knocked himself out.
Guess Who: A self-absorbed sociopath who believes his own lies and an *opportunistic* liar who knows the Truth but cannot stop twisting it.

I trust all politicians...until they open their mouths and speak.
It seems to me that one must unlearn a great deal of what one has been taught in order to discover what is actually True.
Every religion inadvertently hides the Truth that it most seeks to reveal.
If God meant man to fish, he'd have bear claws for fingers, talons for toes. As for golf, two eyes would be knee level and 2 atop the head.
