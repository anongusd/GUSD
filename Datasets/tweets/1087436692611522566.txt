@realDonaldTrump Willfully ignorant and trolling isn't a good look for a #POTUS.
@lenny_phil I'm pretty sure Fox News puts them all through a "This is all so crazy, what's happening to our country?" expression course so they can ensure their narrative is always enforced, even when the message isn't explicity doing so. https://t.co/0socei2UCB

@bensteinbrener @PrestonMitchum Aw, look at you with al that hostility. Lets see, parrot back my point about what kind of example you are making of yourself? Check. Pretending you know what all POC think and generalizing? check. PEtty snipe about my followers on a 3 day old account? check. Try harder sweetie.

@bensteinbrener @PrestonMitchum Oh sweetie, I know you want to think you're coming to their rescue by trying to make an example of me, but you're really just making a statement about yourself, and it isn't a flattering one. How about you take your snark somewhere where it might be useful?
@bensteinbrener @PrestonMitchum I love it when people imply that I can't have an opinion based on the color of my skin. Funny ü§£
@RandhawaaJashan Considering how many "personal comments" you have made, and ironically make in this tweet, that is quite entertaining. More projection about sons that don't exist, and I really do worry about your sister. There is something deeply wrong with you. Run away, little boy. #incel
@RandhawaaJashan Hatred, huh? That's rich. Don't worry, I knew you would give up, considering you know what I am saying is true. You are labeling all feminists as "man-haters" as a smokescreen to the fact that you are a woman-hater. I just hope you don't take your anger out on your poor sister :(

@MHancock74 @KJB30 @TomiLahren @iamcardib Theres that projection again. I point out how triggered you are, and your only response is to call me "triggered" lol. You poor thing, I must have really hurt you!

@MHancock74 @KJB30 @TomiLahren @iamcardib You're getting pretty emotional now. I love how morons show what they are by simply parroting back what is said to them. I say "your ilk"? Inevitably the shallow-minded retort is "your kind". Original *AND* classy lol.

@MHancock74 @KJB30 @TomiLahren @iamcardib This is where you start spinning off into any attacks you can try because you got triggered and emotional. We see it from your ilk every time. It's internet therapy for you, since no one else will listen to you vent your frustrations with your pathetic life. #incel
@MHancock74 @KJB30 @TomiLahren @iamcardib I imagine responses like this are why you have to vent frustrations with your pathetic life online, no one will engage with you in real life anymore. Not with that penchant for talking down and belittling others. Classy stuff, Michael, enjoy being that person.
@MHancock74 @KJB30 @TomiLahren @iamcardib That's the point of the conversatation - "Contributions to society", no? But I see your self consciousness is making you obsess with that point. So that's what you do, bait "contributions to society" then pretend outrage when yours relative to cardiB's is pointed out? Classy.

@RandhawaaJashan You have no idea what you are talking about. #feminism has nothing to do with "hating men", nor do we look down on men. We only look down on boys such as yourself who use "feminism" as an excuse to rationalize their own hatred for women and their proclivity to "look down on women
@PrestonMitchum As an idiom, it has been used long before it was taken to mean it's present slang. When celebrities enter phrases into the popular lexicon, they do so knowing that it will be repeated by fans, and it has nothing to do with race.
@PrestonMitchum Is there language that white people use that black people are not "allowed" to use without attirbution, too?
@RandhawaaJashan How would we feel? You are doing that right now, with your original point. Woman-haters simply projecting their bullshit and calling the women they hate "man-haters" to rationalize their #mysoginy. Grow up.
@oo7beta @STEPHMHAMILL Yes, project your behavior on to others and pretend it is they, not you with the problem. #incel
@oo7beta @STEPHMHAMILL I didn't do any of the things you're saying, sweetheart. It's glaringly obvious you are just trying to argue in circles to waste peoples time. I hope you are at least getting paid to do so, and not simply doing it to vent your life frustrations lol. #incels
@oo7beta @STEPHMHAMILL Oh sweetheart, you've convinced people you don't know what you're talking about yourself, you didn't need my help. Then you got "emotional" about it and really showed everyone what you are all about. Enjoy that feeling ;)
@oo7beta @STEPHMHAMILL Yes, I am calling you an Incel. Your attempts to mischaraacterize points means you either lack reading comprehension, or are simple looking to vent your frustrations with your pathetic life online, either way, enjoy it honey, and ask yourself who got "emotional" lol. #incel

@oo7beta @STEPHMHAMILL Yes, you really do need credentials to say it, not because you can't voice your opinion, but because you've deluded yourself into thinking you know something about that which you obviously don't.
