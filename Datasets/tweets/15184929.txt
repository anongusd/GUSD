@mima_alh @CMachnow It’s your idea Reem :-) my view is that ideas such as these offered in a public forum can be used, but attribution where possible is always good
@lizdolinski They are. These are not for a specific audience, but as a generic keynote title to be adapted for particular situations. The actual audience would usually be fairly or very senior businesspeople, so varying digital knowledge.
@wendyinfutures @lyndons Indeed, the title would shape the presentation, i am framing a generic keynote rather than for a specific audience, the question is really which of these topics would be of most interest.

@moehlert @Collaborizm Solutions depend on the structure of the crowdsourcing. Pure voting is highly fallible. Prediction structures for example are useful in that they reward being aligned with the consensus or outcomes. Can be gamed but harder.

@moehlert @Collaborizm You know the answer Mark :-) yes, of course any ‘game’ is at risk of being gamed. So you need to build safeguards and always be aware of potential bias. It doesn’t mean internal crowdsourcing can’t be valuable, just that due caution is needed.

@ThomasRTroland @Digiday Absolutely. To my point that value is in the eyes of the 'consumer', it can be assessed in how much they are prepared to pay, in whatever manner. Value and Capturing value  can be quite different things - value is intangible and differentiated, value capture is easily defined.
@mdawes2 @INSEADKnowledge @acdelion Certainly agree, though it is also true there is the potential to over-regulate data. In some cases the very tight EU data legislation effectively acts against consumer interests, I believe.

In the first day of 280 characters on Twitter, what I like best is that you can actually have a discussion. Especially when handles were included, it was impossible to make a meaningful, balanced point in 140 char, so I rarely bothered to engage. Now proper dialogue is possible
@thehoneybar Fair question - the most obvious answer is that the potential scope could eclipse other factors
@mdawes2 Thanks Mark, this is arguably the crux of tech development in coming years - computers will become emotionally aware and engaging - but it's not clear how people will respond. Likely there will be a divide between those who like it or reject it.
