Do you thinks there's benefit in earlier intervention such as high/primary school? @roseg @ancientchildren #DV
See, therein lies the challenge, it's those who potentially need More guidance missing in action. How to saturate? @roseg @ancientchildren
@Aql74 Thank you Shamila, my word that's a long time, Aus population such a young country. I have difficulty understanding this logic.
It's a remarkable gesture &amp; what follows demonstrates Australian sentiment towards inclusion. I'm in total agreement. @myknittingwool
Agreed, far better children/family outcomes in terms of external influences such as imed' neighbourhood. @roseg @ancientchildren
Moving forward, I yearn for the day this practice becomes historical. @notthatCate @interUNFAO @dikkii @brassidio @melvict
There's a first time for everything. Agreed better own comments on something controversial than being misinterpreted by others. @ki_sekiya
And out of the dark, came a light..... @3wombats
There are strong minded individuals who distance thmslvs from upbringing or soc settings &amp; commit to break cycle @ancientchildren @roseg
That would be troubling, hopefully maturity brings deeper understanding of how to break the cycle. @roseg @ancientchildren
Agree, definite connections. @roseg @ancientchildren
Perhaps thru promoting parenting classes, while mums/couples at pregnancy check ups as well as anti natal, @roseg @ancientchildren
Agreed, I do think public sentiment is changing a whole, which may also have external influence. @ancientchildren @roseg

Me too. 	@SallyRMelb @LukeLPearson @AppeloniaPahye
The point is, racism is racism, is one more a victim than the others? Is one more entitled to be? @AppeloniaPahye @LukeLPearson
I know who I am &amp; that I'm well intentioned. You want to crucify me on one comment. More power to you. @LukeLPearson @AppeloniaPahye
Luke it's not for starting a hash tag, I've made that pretty clear. @LukeLPearson @AppeloniaPahye
I do understand that. It's still senseless and inhumane @notthatCate @interUNFAO @dikkii @brassidio @melvict
Yes, I do, point taken, @nareenyoung
My context has been misunderstood, not bagging, I was sympathizing with victims of violence @nareenyoung Please see. https://t.co/wILVLL7M6C
Difficult to completely change beliefs of individuals to confirm to new social norms. Perhaps thru teaching child? @ancientchildren @roseg
