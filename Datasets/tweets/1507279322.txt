@c_johnson_VT @peterdaou @pedallas49 Right, impeachment isn't removal, but there are plenty who have no idea of the full scope of Trump &amp; Co.'s corruption and criminality. Open investigation by the House will go a long way to educating voters for 2020. #FlipTheWhiteHouse
From the "truth is not truth" crew, this gem from @AlanDersh: ‚ÄúYou need to draw a line between what is extortion-ish &amp; what is extortion consistent w/ 1st Amendment." There is no extortion consistent w/ by 1A. Laws are still laws, crimes are still crimes. https://t.co/lut3EDjCNp
@peterdaou @pedallas49 I think we of course have to vote, and in large numbers, but I think we also need to pursue impeachment as a logical next step of the investigations. I'm afraid of too much interference in our electoral system to be able to rely on it to solve our Trump problem.

@Sen_JoeManchin @NPR @frontlinepbs "That coal mine made your lungs dirty, didn't it?'" Kelly recalled Caden, his 9 year old son, asking. "Yeah it did. ... And I can't breathe and I have to have my backpack to breathe."
@Sen_JoeManchin @NPR @frontlinepbs Miners do NOT want their children to have to suffer the way they have. They want investment and re-training for #CleanEnergy jobs, which this administration has instead cut back on. Will you step up and fight for #GreenNewDeal for your constituents?
@Sen_JoeManchin Senator, too many times you've voted like a Repub. Now's the time to prove that Dems stand up &amp; fight for our workers. As @NPR &amp; @frontlinepbs show, dangers to miners are only increasing with rising silica levels in the remaining coal seams. #GreenNewDeal https://t.co/ySUMrFvBMb
