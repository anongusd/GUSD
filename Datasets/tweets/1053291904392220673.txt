Hey @FedEx what is the fucking problem?	This insane. Why can’t you deliver my package? The signed authorization is on my door!	@AppleSupport can you just send me a new watch? FedEx can’t seem to do their only job
@EricTrump What have you ever done?
#FedEx just didn’t show on their delivery date.	I missed their day late delivery because people have to work (except I can do my job correctly).	Put the signature form on the door for a 2 day late delivery. They delivered to a FedEx store. Went to pick up, they didn’t have it...
Going on 5 days dealing with their incompetence.
Really wish @AppleSupport used anybody but @FedEx to deliver their products. Have 0 confidence I’ll ever get my watch returned and on my wrist again.
@GOP @VP It should start with gov officials.	Give up your socialist healthcare and pension.
Fuck you @FedEx you’re fucking worthless at your only service .
@DonaldJTrumpJr @BreitbartNews Just cherry pick a few good things for the Trump’s forget all the other hours of testimony that was extremely damaging to the isolated world your family has created for itself.

@GOPChairwoman @DonaldJTrumpJr But he HAD to tell the truth today. Otherwise he’d go away longer and there is no reduction in his sentence for whatever he said today. A majority believe Cohen, a minority believe Trump and his faithful followers.
Hey @AppleSupport , how can @FedEx be trusted to deliver my package, but they can’t hold it at one of their facilities? Requires signature and only given “arrives by 8pm” on tracking.	You understand people have jobs to pay for your $300+ products, right??
