"I completely reject the term Socialist America, the real threat for the people in this country, is that this administration is cozying up to Communist Russia and Communist China so much," says @DougJones.
How do you run as a Democrat in Alabama?	"Folks in Alabama and in the South have much more in common than things that divide us but we’ve just not had people stepping up… that’s healthcare, that’s jobs, economy, education. That’s from all walks of life," says @DougJones.
"Just about every Republican in Alabama is seeing stars in their eyes right now but we’ll be ready for whoever it ends up being," says @DougJones on his reelection bid.
"When that bombing occurred in Birmingham and four innocent children died it really woke up the conscious of America, it really rattled the conscious of a Congress, of a President, and it spurred what became the Civil Rights Act ('64) and the Voting Rights Act ('65)," @DougJones.
Now: Senator @DougJones talks about his new book "Bending Toward Justice: The Birmingham Church Bombing that Changed the Course of Civil Rights" (All Points Books, 2019), and the state of the Democratic Party in Alabama. https://t.co/JE6GnVgu5p https://t.co/zRa8WSi9xS
"We’re confident that this has been a breakthrough in how our country is starting to view economic development, starting to hold these corporations accountable for delivering on promises," says @DebAxt.
"We are in direct communication with these constituencies every day… we talk to them all the time about how NYC is becoming a city they can no longer live in because it’s becoming too expensive… and that’s why we’re pushing back against [the Amazon deal]," says @javierhvaldes.
"We will not accept the kind of spiked gentrification that Amazon’s presence in Seattle has started, that we will not accept our Governor giving away our tax dollars and partnering with the most predatory corporation perhaps in the history of the world," says @DebAxt.
Now: @javierhvaldes and @DebAxt, co-executive directors of @MaketheRoadNY, respond to the fact that the governor said he never heard of the group, and explain why, in their opinion, an anti-Amazon stance is representative of New Yorkers. https://t.co/JE6GnVgu5p
"Asset forfeiture does fund some programs that law enforcement needs… and there’s a stigma that cannabis is associated with crime, and that’s true, the data do show that," says @alysonrmartin.
"With Democratic control, the lawmakers have agreed that legalization is coming, I think the real debate is about how, and that’s where the delays could be," says @alysonrmartin. Cites local control, taxes, big industry and home grow as issues.
Now: @alysonrmartin, writer and co-founder @CannabisWire, discusses the politics behind legalizing marijuana in New York State.
"That worked twice when George Washington was up for election and promptly after that the electoral college became a fiasco." 2/2 https://t.co/Ssd6fx5DQR

"As it stands it’s a long shot for Democrats to win the Senate in 2020, the odds of Democrats winning 60 Senate seats are close impossible," says @jbouie.

Will congestion pricing and cannabis legalization pass the Albany budget deadline?	"I’m an optimist... Marijuana I believe will pass, should pass, if we don’t get it done by the budget I think we’re in trouble," says @NYGovCuomo.
"You can walk faster now than a bus can move. You need congestion pricing or you raise the fair on subway riders, which would be worse," says @NYGovCuomo.
"We want all businesses nationwide to know that this was an oddity. Don’t think that if you come to New York the same thing will happen that happened to Amazon. That was a small, vocal minority. That was local, petty politics that governed the day," says @NYGovCuomo.
"We want to say, here are the facts, we want you in New York, we welcome business. They have given no indication that they would reconsider. The point was more, not that Amazon is going to change its mind, but the truth should be known," says @NYGovCuomo.
Now: @NYGovCuomo joins to talk about his efforts — including personal pitches to Amazon's head Jeff Bezos — to get the tech giant to change its mind again, and re-start plans for a New York hub. https://t.co/JE6GnVgu5p
"When we talk about Democratic Socialism what I mean are economic rights. I believe that healthcare is a human right… that education is a human right…. We talk about the existential issue of making sure the planet will be habitable for our children," @BernieSanders.
"All I can say is what Cohen talked about it really was a confirmation of what people have assumed and that is that Donald Trump is a pathological liar, he is a fraud and he is likely involved in criminal activities," says @BernieSanders.

"Background checks that government officials have to go through to get these clearances, a big part is making sure that there’s nothing in your background that would make you susceptible to blackmail," says @anniekarni on why Kushner's top secret clearance has been objected to.
"The President, in just ordering that he wants his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to have this top secret clearance is totally within his rights. That’s not the problem. The President denied that he had personally granted this clearance," says @anniekarni.

"Quite often the pharmaceutical benefit manager might have a deal behind the scenes to forward the non-generic drug. You should always ask ‘is there a generic?’” says @JPinderHealth.
"Costco has a lot of low prices. Most people don’t realize Costco has a pharmacy," says @JPinderHealth on how to get the best deal for your prescription drugs.

@blackzelig Oh no, we hope you're okay!

"Every witness in every mob trial is, in fact, a criminal but I really have to give the Republicans credit, they were expressing tremendous shock and amazement that we were interrogating a convicted criminal," says @BorowitzReport on the Michael Cohen testimony.
"One thing that’s great about Trump is that he loves these dictators… they’re really his kind of people. He offered Kim Jong Un his Vice President, Mike Pence, to serve as his man servant... That’s the one thing that came out of the summit," jokes @BorowitzReport.

"In the space of 21 hours we saw: a candidate for President of Nigeria, Vice President Pence, Reince Priebus, Seb Gorka and a bunch of MAGA world celebrities. It was absolutely eye opening," says @ilyamarritz after spending a night at the Trump International Hotel.

"It was June of 1973 when John Dean gave that testimony and Richard Nixon didn’t resign until August of 1974. History makes it all seem quicker and neater in hindsight. No one came out of yesterday saying this is the beginning of the end," @sbg1.
"Conservatives are in a bind here in general… President Trump is constantly forcing them in the awkward position of either choosing to defend or not some very dubious personal behavior," says @sbg1.
On the Trump children:	"Their legal exposure here is significant. They are not the President. They are subject, potentially, to criminal prosecution.... Now we’re looking at a whole array of criminal examinations of the Trump family businesses," says @sbg1.
"I was actually just trying to do a count of how many claims that Michael Cohen made that the President lied and I haven’t finished the count because there are so many," says @sbg1.

"There is one other possible area for legal exposure for Don Jr. that came up today. It has to do with Trump Tower Moscow," says @AndreaWNYC. Cohen testified today that he briefed Don Jr. about 10 times on the project.
"Father and son were both involved in making the repayment of the hush money," says @ilyamarritz of new information from the Michael Cohen testimony on how Donald Trump and Trump Jr. both paid hush money payments to Stormy Daniels.

"The hypocrisy of having these zero tolerance policies for things like pro-choice political candidates but not being able to enunciate a zero tolerance policy for covering up the rape of children really undermines the Catholic Church’s moral authority," says @nimperatori.
"The Vatican is a machine that was created 1,000 years ago," says theologian and historian @MassimoFaggioli. "I see more changes than things that are not changing. Honestly, the pace of change is slow but I think it’s undeniable that it’s happening."
"Some good things came out of the [Vatican] summit, I think, the default position of blaming homosexuality… seemed to get no traction in Rome. A shift away from talking about abuse as a sin of chastity and more toward an abuse of power, was also a good sign," says @nimperatori.

"[Roger] Stone’s defense of himself, for what it’s worth, is he realized it was wrong after he posted it and he didn’t realize there a target in the picture… and he thought the target image was a Celtic cross," says @DevlinBarrett.
"Roger Stone needs to make money and this may have been a poorly thought out attempt to raise more money for his legal defense but it’s so destructive. This is the worst possible thing you can do because this judge holds your fate in your hand," says @DevlinBarrett.

"We need a vacancy tax for commercial properties... they take the property off the market, demand a higher rent than they can get and it sits there… If a landlord does not rent out their property after a reasonable period of time they have to pay a tax on it," says @NYCMayor.
"The problem is the misuse and the illegal abuse and the fact that public employees, who we’re supposed to put our trust in, unfortunately are breaking that trust. It’s been part of the culture for decades and decades," says @NYCMayor on the city cracking down on placard abuse.
Will Amazon leaving NYC impact future business deals? 	"The rest of our business community works with the city by and large and understands why this is a great city... I think it was a lost opportunity but I don’t think there are larger ramifications," says @NYCMayor.
"What Amazon did was arbitrary and… inappropriate given there was an agreement… they apparently wanted a situation where there was no dissent… if you want total unanimity, don’t come to New York City would be my advice to anyone," says @NYCMayor.

"The first graders were very well versed in telling me how to handle a lockdown for the first time. You have a six year old telling an adult how to handle the situation, they were very knowledgeable," says caller Adele, who teaches an after-school program in the Bronx.
Since it's February break, are there any teachers listening, or parents? We want to hear from you on how much good or harm you think school lockdowns do. Tweet or call now at 212-433-9692.
"We are seeing school districts that are more thoughtful putting in steps. They don’t go from zero to 100 right away… things called lock-out or shelter-in-place, where no one can come in the school but lights are kept on and the teaching can continue," says @JohnWoodrowCox.
"There are people who maintain that kids won’t take [lockdowns] seriously unless we surprise them… you’re doing potentially real damage to kids. Schools, if they’re doing drills, should always… tell everyone that this is a drill, that it’s not real," says @JohnWoodrowCox.
"We saw that kids would write wills, saying 'this is who I want to leave my PlayStation to.' There were kids countless times who texted their parents goodbye. There were kids who soiled themselves. The fear was extreme," says @JohnWoodrowCox on the trauma of school lockdowns.

"Even though the jobs idea is a promise and it's extremely enticing, you have to wonder why is Amazon asking for so many incentives when they’re already so big and so rich," says @JuanMaBenitez on AOC's opposition to the Amazon LIC deal.
"Sometimes [AOC] feels that she’s the only one who read the deal between the city, the state and Amazon. It’s a really complicated issue for people to understand... and to poll," says @JuanMaBenitez on why the Congresswoman rejected the Amazon LIC deal.
AOC "didn’t come out of nowhere, she’s channeling the idea the perspectives of many New Yorkers right now… she’s also channeling the views of many Americans all over the country," who want politicians to represent their needs, says @JuanMaBenitez.

"When JFK said we’re going to go to the moon by the end of the 1960s people didn’t say ‘well that’s going to cost x, y, z.’ The Green New Deal should be looked at as a way of focusing the intention of the country on climate change and job growth at the same time," @jonathanalter.
"If Trump had his way, five young Black + Latino men would've been executed for a crime they didn't commit. That tells you everything we’ve learned about his contempt for rule of law... for the Constitution, we learned that a long time ago," says @jonathanalter on Central Park 5.

"What Democrats wanted to do was cap the number of beds that ICE could have for interior detentions at about 16,000 so they would force them to be only arresting and detaining people that are actually criminals and that’s not what’s been happening," says @HeathaT.
"This number of beds that there are and the cap, both parties have supported it at some point. The companies that benefit from this… have huge, strong lobbies here in Washington, D.C." says @HeathaT on the number of beds in ICE detention facilities.
"Everyone is trying to avoid a government shutdown, but what they have done is purposefully given Trump less for border barriers. Someone explained to me as kind of sending a message that shutting down the government gets you less rather than more," says @HeathaT.

Would Newark take Amazon if NYC doesn't?	"We absolutely are still interested. As they know we were one of the front-runners… Newark is where it’s at. Newark is trending. We will be the next world class destination city," says @CarmeloGarcia, Newark's chief development officer.
"We look at it as a clear opportunity at shifting and reshaping the way the funding is going to be used for these distressed neighborhoods… we want all ships to rise and this is going to be the tide to make it happen," says @CarmeloGarcia on the opportunity zone benefit.
"Amazon has come out and said they’re not going to use the 'opportunity zone' benefit. Even if they don’t use the benefit directly… it could be used by whoever is building the entire structure and Amazon could access to cheaper financing as a result," says @anjucomet.
"Some people have argued that the kinds of benefits that accrue to developers and investors make ['opportunity zones'] more of gentrification subsidy rather than actually help people who live there," says @anjucomet.
"There is some very clever overlap with places they were pitching Amazon and places they were declaring 'opportunity zones,'" says @CalebMelby from @business.

"Heating issues, lack of access to warm water, lack of access to food, are all conditions that exist in federal facilities across the country, in state prisons across the country and in local jails. Heat is always an issue," says @KhaCumberbatch from @NYForJustice. https://t.co/CSlkwJZLhY

"I have talked to voters and heard from lawmakers here in Richmond who say that they think it’s possible to forgive Ralph Northam, the man, the individual, but certainly not the office holder, not the governor," says @MalloryNoePayne.
"Every day that we’re talking about Virginia, Fairfax or Northam, we’re not talking about the border, we're not talking about Puerto Rico... Flint... our 2020 candidates and policies. They are a clear distraction." 2/2 https://t.co/Sfo2ysmdeR
"National Democrats are trying to figure out just how much they want to insert themselves into the situation. Keep in mind the narrative has shifted to Fairfax, we have yet to deal with Northam," says @Dr_CMGreer. 1/2

"One of the things about being a developed nation is that we have lower birth rates… we have what is called a natural negative replacement rate. It if wasn’t for immigration we’d be like Japan," says @AliVelshi on what Trump and Stephen Miller get wrong about immigration.
"There is an almost even percentage of people who would be Democratic voters who think the party needs to be more liberal as that it needs to become more moderate. Where do you stand in order to capture the most Democratic voters?" says @AliVelshi
"With Stacey Abrams it is clear that the Democratic party think she’s a rising star… her message was good but they also wanted to portray a type of person. This is a person who has working class roots," says @anitakumar01.
"All the people who doubted Nancy Pelosi’s strength and vigor… the skirmishes with Donald Trump since she’s become speaker seem to have invigorated her," says @AliVelshi.

"What we take today as America’s principle of freedom of speech and press is relatively new… it’s counter-intuitive and fragile. There’s no reason to think that the U.S. is invulnerable to the rise in intolerance that we’ve seen in past periods," @Columbia's Pres. Bollinger.
"We have 100 years of jurisprudence of free speech, it took us 50 years to get it to where it is today…. In those 50 years it’s been the Supreme Court that’s refined this doctrine," says @Columbia's President Bollinger.

"SALT only affects the richer people in society. You get to a state like New York where you are disproportionately dependent on the richest. 1% of the richest pay 50% of the taxes. I believe Trump knew exactly what he was doing," says @NYGovCuomo.
"The states with the largest revenue decline in the country: New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, California, Massachusetts. Those are all states impacted by SALT," says @NYGovCuomo.
On Trump's tax reform: "It was complicated so people didn’t get it.... There was a provision that ended SALT, what it did was it set up two tax structures in this nation and the Democratic states pay higher taxes than the Republican states," says @NYGovCuomo.
Now: @NYGovCuomo talks about the news that State Sen. Gianaris will have a seat on the board that could vote against the Amazon deal, the state tax revenue shortfall and more. https://t.co/JE6GnVgu5p
"There are a lot of members of Congress that could have done this response [to Trump's SOTU], none of those people were chosen. This was an effort on leadership not to put their hand on the scale either way for anyone who is in the presidential race," says @jeneps.
"How much anti-Trump is too much? How do you at once stand up for your values… while also pushing back on Trump’s falsehoods? It’s the inherent challenge that every Democrat faces," says @jeneps.

"One thing I find particularly offensive is that the [@NYCHA/@HUDNY_NJ] agreement allows NYCHA 20 years to abate all lead in public housing. By the time NYCHA is done with lead abatement, I will have an AARP card. That’s ridiculous," says @RitchieTorres.
"I’m a skeptic about the deal. NYCHA is in a state of emergency and yet the agreement contains no new emergency funding from the government… there’s not clear mechanism for enforcement but the worst feature is that there’s no court supervision," says @RitchieTorres.
"The episode at the detention center… I commend the Mayor for sending an emergency response team with blankets, with hand warmers, with generators. I thought this moment demonstrated the best in city government and city grassroots activism," says @RitchieTorres.
NOW: Councilmember @RitchieTorres argues the HUD/NYC agreement on NYCHA is not sufficient to solve the problems there and talks about the Brooklyn jail that went without heat and power during the polar vortex last week. https://t.co/JE6GnVgu5p

"Cory Booker is sometimes like a freestyle rapper who quotes other freestyle rappers… it’s unclear what Cory Booker is actually for other than citing other people’s speeches. Voters are going to wait and see what he’s actually about," says @_waleedshahid.
"[Dem politicians] want to have it both ways; they want to endorse Medicare for All or the Green New Deal but then they either struggle to explain the policy or aren’t actually not in favor of the policy. They just want the benefits of being part of the movement," @_waleedshahid.

"It’s really good that Democrats are holding their own accountable... this makes the Democratic party much, much stronger and committed to fighting for people of color… I think letting Northam stay would sell those people out," @_waleedshahid.

"Impeaching [Trump] now is a favor to him, it focuses attention on House Dems who are never going to be popular with Republicans and instead gives the GOP reasons for unity. I think Democrats should be strategic about this and peel off Republican support," says @DLeonhardt.
"I don’t think there’s any question that [Trump] deserves to be impeached… I think the better thing for Democrats to do, and Republicans who are horrified about this, is to call attention to the things he has done and wait for the Mueller report," says @DLeonhardt.
"While I agree that there is a risk that a female candidate is damaged by sexism… the mere notion of having a female nominee will play some role in curing that sexism. It’ll then be the second time in a row and it won’t be one of the Clintons who come with baggage," @DLeonhardt.
"As the summer of 2016 came around, it became clear that Hillary Clinton had a lot of weaknesses as a candidate, but it was too late, Democrats really hadn’t run a full campaign.... Democrats shouldn’t try eliminating candidates at this stage," says @DLeonhardt.

"There’s an idea that we have about what a professor and a scholar does and it’s work that is separate from the work of the community… the thing that matters most, the gold standard is still peer reviewed research," says @triciamatthew.

"We went to Sinaloa where El Chapo is from and spoke with impoverished farmers who used to make a living growing marijuana and selling to the cartel. After the drug started becoming legal in the United States… the value of their crop plummeted," says @keegan_hamilton.

"It is smart to postpone the State of the Union when the government isn't open…. The real action has to be in the Senate and it requires Republicans to come forward… and say to their President 'the game is up here... we’ll deal with the border issue later,’” says @NYCMayor.
"They’ve got to come up with a third way because having filled with people’s residential garbage doesn’t help us, and not having the public trash cans doesn’t help us," says @NYCMayor, and adds he is waiting for a solution from the Sanitation Department as early as next week.

@politico @joshgerstein @WNYC Remember, Trump asked Comey to go easy on Michael Flynn. Flynn was at core of Robert Mueller's appointment and obstruction of justice investigation.		@joshgerstein adds: WH effort to defend Flynn continued thru yesterday. Why r they so eager to defend him even at this late date?
@politico @joshgerstein @WNYC @joshgerstein: Flynn was never grilled about question: why did he lie to FBI agents? If the situation was so casual, why didn't he just tell the truth to them? It seems strange to reflexively lie about fairly technical matters.
@politico @joshgerstein @WNYC @joshgerstein: Usually a lengthier statement of facts in addition to a guilty plea. In Flynn's case, said that he had submitted several inaccurate statements to DOJ. Basically suggested his work benefited Turkish gov, but he didn't think he was working for Turkish gov directly.
@politico @joshgerstein @WNYC Did Flynn's pro-Turkey op-ed put him on the DOJ's radar?		@joshgerstein: It certainly raised red flags. "It does have the odor...of something that was...planted by a foreign government and Flynn has essentially admitted that's...what went on."

@mockingbirdbway @WNYC Aaron Sorkin: Generally in popular culture, our elected leaders have been portrayed either as Machiavellian or dolts. On the West Wing, I wanted them to be hyper-competent people. 		Adds House of Cards is the best version of the Machiavellian role, and that's where we are today.
@mockingbirdbway @WNYC Any NYC public school student can see @mockingbirdbway for 10 dollars.
@mockingbirdbway @WNYC Roxane Gay wrote that the black characters Tom Robinson and Calpurnia were narrative devices rather than realized human beings. (https://t.co/8li94FNSE5)		Aaron Sorkin agrees, says when book was written, no one would have noticed. In 2018, it's wrong and a waste of opportunity.
@mockingbirdbway @WNYC Aaron Sorkin: There is a kind of maddening liberal habit to look inward and blame ourselves for stuff that's going on, and to tolerate racism, which is what we're doing when we say Trump tapped into economic anxiety.
@mockingbirdbway @WNYC Sorkin: There's no event that occurs in the play that doesn't occur in the book, nor is the play an attempt to correct mistakes that Harper Lee made. The play is simply a play, written by a different writer, trying to use the 50+ years of experience we have to examine Atticus.
@mockingbirdbway @WNYC When the Scott Rudin, producer of @mockingbirdbway, asked Aaron Sorkin to adapt the book, he had two thoughts. 		One, this is fantastic. 		Two, "I'm going to Google 'how to fake your own death'."

@JohnGPeet @WNYC @TheEconomist @JohnGPeet: [cont] Brexiteers being dishonest claiming they have a solution.
@JohnGPeet @WNYC @TheEconomist @JohnGPeet: Fair to say very few people thought about Ireland border before referendum. Problem is there are now no checkpoints bt N Ireland (UK) &amp; Republic of Ireland (EU), but with #Brexit need to address how movement across border would work. [cont]
@JohnGPeet @WNYC @TheEconomist If there were another referendum, might there be a large turnout from Remain contingent who didn't vote the first time?		@JohnGPeet: Possibly, considering young people (largely Remain) tend to turn out less than old (largely Leave). But also realize 2016 turnout was very high.
@JohnGPeet @WNYC @TheEconomist Is a Hard Brexit the same thing as a No Deal Brexit?		@JohnGPeet: No, in a No Deal Brexit, everything falls. Nobody knows what it would involve. Government has forecasted that it would be much more damaging than any other form.

"Because state legislatures in the 11 former slave holding states consistently allow public tax dollars to go to White parents to offset tuition costs to send them to these private schools, the impact of it was to create underfunded all-Black public schools," says @nrookie.
"Both that school and the school [Cindy Hyde-Smith] sent her daughter to… are what’s known as segregation academies. These were schools that were founded in the South in the decade following Brown v Board," says @nrookie.

"I offered to shake hands with anyone there, and there are people who refused to shake my hand, or say ‘I don’t think you’re a Christian but I’ll pray for you.’... It was rough in some spots," says @AriMelber re: antisemitism while reporting on the Florida midterm recount.

It would be hard for acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, to stuff the Mueller investigation without public knowledge. If he chose to overrule Mueller's indictments, Whitaker would have to notify Congress about what he overruled and why, says @PostRoz.
"This move was done primarily because the President did not like the fact that Jeff Sessions was not in charge of the investigation, wanted someone he felt was more of a loyalist, a pitbull for him, someone he perceived to be his own lawyer in charge of that investigation." 2/2 https://t.co/oFSKciRCMN
Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, was skipped over for acting AG. "As far as we can tell it’s because [Rosenstein has] allowed the Mueller probe a free hand and allowed it to move forward," says @PostRoz. https://t.co/JE6GnVgu5p 1/2

Trump has stopped talking about the "threat" of the caravan since the midterm, suggesting--as was suspected--that the image was a fear-mongering tactic used to get out the base, says @jbouie
The near win of Gillum and Abrams suggests, as a campaign strategy, Democrats should "directly confront" Trump's abject racism, says @jbouie. What do you think?

@HowieHawkins @LarrySharpe @MinerForNY @MinerForNY: We have to say to everybody, we believe public service means more than having a D or R in front of your name.
@HowieHawkins @LarrySharpe @MinerForNY @LarrySharpe: @HowieHawkins &amp; I agree on many things: better environment &amp; healthcare. But my ideas do not include more taxes.		On education, wants to get rid of standardized testing until high school &amp; make public education K-10.
@HowieHawkins @LarrySharpe @MinerForNY @HowieHawkins: I'm the only progressive option for liberals, progressives, &amp; socialists. Says Green New Deal, centerpiece of his candidacy, is to realize rights to job that pays living wage, a decent home, comprehensive healthcare, &amp; a good education. + 100% clean energy by 2030.

@SykesCharlie @esglaude @agrenell @WNYC @SykesCharlie says when you tell an unemployed blue collar worker in his 50s that he's privileged, it's not going to play the way you think. 		@agrenell agrees, language is important.
@SykesCharlie @esglaude @agrenell @WNYC @agrenell: The priority placed on understanding aggrieved white men feels misplaced, since white men are not entitled to unearned privilege.
@SykesCharlie @esglaude @agrenell @WNYC @esglaude: "Aggrieved whiteness is dangerous...I come out of a tradition where folks have been put into the ground because of aggrieved whiteness." But I don't know what the difference is when you talk about "white" workers who are catching hell, compared to other races.
@SykesCharlie @esglaude @agrenell @WNYC @SykesCharlie: Racism particularly on the part of the Republican party has always been there, but until Trump it's been a "recessive gene." There were people who tried to turn the party into more inclusive, aspirational movement. Seeing Trump as organic product normalizes him.

@BobHugin Would you vote to repeal the rest of Obamacare?		@BobHugin: "I would not vote to repeal anything unless there's adequate reforms" and "substantive changes."
@BobHugin @BobHugin further claims that the Star-Ledger has "extremist views on these kinds of issues."		"You're repeating things that are not true and you're acting like because they're reported someplace they're facts." Connects it to distrust in media.
@BobHugin Why should voters trust healthcare policy to former pharmaceutical CEO with track record that includes raising drug prices after approval, then cutting in Russia &amp; raising in US (acc to Star Ledger reporting)?		@BobHugin says Brian is repeating things that are not true.

@DeanBaker13 @ceprdc @StephenMoore @Heritage @WNYC @DeanBaker13 says he is one of few economists who was yelling about housing bubble back in 2004, and he's not that worried about "scare stories" that we might be in a new one.		@StephenMoore agrees mostly, but is concerned that banks are back to "their old devious behavior."
@DeanBaker13 @ceprdc @StephenMoore @Heritage @WNYC Plus, @DeanBaker13 says these things are cyclical. Trump had a good second quarter, but it slowed third quarter, and it will continue to slow in the fourth.
@DeanBaker13 @ceprdc @StephenMoore @Heritage @WNYC @DeanBaker13 argues Trump's tax cut did spur growth, but when Obama wanted to put money into the economy, Republicans yelled, 'Deficits, deficits, deficits!'
@DeanBaker13 @ceprdc @StephenMoore @Heritage @WNYC @StephenMoore says we've reversed everything Obama did, so how could he take credit for economy growth now? Says we did have a recovery under Obama, but "there's a big difference between a recovery and a boom, and we're in a boom right now."
@DeanBaker13 @ceprdc @StephenMoore @Heritage @WNYC @DeanBaker13 says this economy has been growing and creating jobs since Obama turned it around. Adds, "Give President Trump credit: he didn't totally blow it."

@JayWebberNJ @MikieSherrill @WNYC @MikieSherrill: "I certainly do" support federal funding for Planned Parenthood.
@JayWebberNJ @MikieSherrill @WNYC @JayWebberNJ said he voted against an equal pay bill bc it was for "substantially similar work" --too broad a term that would just make work for lawyers.		@MikieSherrill: We know jobs can vary slightly. We're trying to accomplish women competing on level playing field.
@JayWebberNJ @MikieSherrill @WNYC @MikieSherrill: @JayWebberNJ "has no history of being somebody other than an ideological politician that puts his own agenda first."
@JayWebberNJ @MikieSherrill @WNYC Turning now to @MikieSherrill.
@JayWebberNJ @MikieSherrill @WNYC @JayWebberNJ: I would have voted for the tax cut bill because we needed to get this economy jump-started, and we have. I'm concerned about deficit and debt, but not as concerned in context of a good economy.
@JayWebberNJ @MikieSherrill @WNYC "Planned Parenthood can still raise money. Nobody's trying to ban Planned Parenthood...but in terms of taxpayer dollars, they should be repurposed and sent to federally qualified health centers," says @JayWebberNJ.
@JayWebberNJ @MikieSherrill @WNYC @JayWebberNJ says the funding for Planned Parenthood should be "repurposed to organizations that provide more and better services to women in America."
@JayWebberNJ @MikieSherrill @WNYC @JayWebberNJ: "I like a lot of what the president does. I don't like everything he says or tweets."

@NRDC @karen_yi @NRDC's Erik Olson: They're not exactly the same, but there are echoes of Flint. You've got a situation where the city was not being straight with people. When the water gets to people's taps, bc the city is not properly treating it, lead leaches, just like in Flint.
@NRDC @karen_yi Is referring to Flint sensationalizing Newark's situation?		@NRDC's Erik Olson: Not at all... [cont'd]
@NRDC @karen_yi @NRDC's Erik Olson: The city should be using corrosion inhibitors. That should have been done decades ago. The rule requiring that was issued in 1991.
@NRDC @karen_yi Lead service lines are privately owned and connect the water main to your home, explains @karen_yi. Newark had said that the high lead levels were due to these lines, but this month they acknowledged that there's also a problem with the way the city treats the water.

@agounardes @agounardes: "I think that anytime that Marty Golden talks about property taxes, it's really, really, laughable."
@agounardes Marty Golden says birth certificates should specify male or female, can change it later on.		@agounardes says Golden is focused on denigrating and taking away people's ability to be themselves. Says it's part of a pattern that includes leading the opposition to marriage equality.
Now: @agounardes, candidate for state senate in District 22, joins to make his case.
@liuba4congress A spate of new Trump-funded ads argue, it's about the economy, vote Republican. 		@liuba4congress: It is about the economy. There are a lot of people who are hurting. The Republicans are still trying to say trickle down economics works when we know it doesn't work.
@liuba4congress @liuba4congress: The Kavanaugh hearings were a job interview to determine whether he was the best candidate. "He clearly proved himself not to be the best candidate."
@liuba4congress Brian asks, You're betting that the people of the south shore of Long Island are ready for #MedicareForAll?		@liuba4congress argues the amount of money they would save not paying premiums, copays, &amp; deductibles would offset taxes.
@liuba4congress Her central issues? 		"The economy, healthcare, taxes, environment, education."
@liuba4congress @liuba4congress: "A wall is not going to do anything...it's a waste of money."		Says we need to invest in "modern security" at borders, but that immigration is not a central issue in her compaign.
On now: @liuba4congress, congressional candidate for NY 2, makes her case.
@TanyaGold1 @splcenter @Hatewatch @WNYC @TanyaGold1 says Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the UK's Labour Party, which sits center-left, is an anti-Semite. (Points to his attempt to rename Holocaust Memorial Day to Genocide Memorial Day, among other things.) Says fact that he doesn't know he's anti-Semitic is immaterial.
@TanyaGold1 @splcenter @Hatewatch @WNYC During the civil rights movement, racism was so deep that people believed black activists could not organize themselves, that Jews were orchestrating them, explains Heidi Beirich.		Beirich: "Anti-Semitism sits behind all of these kinds of racism and ugliness."
@TanyaGold1 @splcenter @Hatewatch @WNYC But Heidi Beirich notes, whether Trump knows what he's talking about or not, when White Supremacists hear the words globalism and nationalism, they do have a particular idea in mind. "You can't hear nationalism coming out of his mouth and not think about all this."
@TanyaGold1 @splcenter @Hatewatch @WNYC Trump said on Fox last night that he looks "at two things: globalists and nationalists."		"I'm sorry, but that just sounded like babble to me," says @TanyaGold1. 		And she's not surprised he quickly becomes vague on the subject: "I think he doesn't really know what he believes."
@TanyaGold1 @splcenter @Hatewatch @WNYC Listeners call in with questions about hate and anti-Semitism for @TanyaGold1 &amp; Heidi Beirich of @splcenter. 212-433-9692.
@TanyaGold1 @splcenter @Hatewatch @WNYC New technology has allowed people to send out hateful propaganda in ways they could not before, says Heidi Beirich. It's not the kind of thing you might see in a public park.		Robert Bowers was on Gab. "Dylan Roof learned how to hate through Google searches," says Beirich.

@ReconJudaism @WNYC Rabbi Waxman: I think that the Reconstructionist response to rising anti-semitism--along with Islamophobia and racism--is to double down on our commitments. We have an incredible opportunity in America to put forward what a non-fundamentalist expression of religion can look like.
@ReconJudaism @WNYC Many Reconstructionist synagogues have active social justice committees, says Rabbi Deborah Waxman. 		Rabbi Waxman: We understand as Jews that a society is only as healthy as the well-being of the most vulnerable within it.

@RepLanceNJ7 @Malinowski @Malinowski: I do not support #MedicareForAll. I support giving everybody the freedom to buy into a public option.
@RepLanceNJ7 @Malinowski @Malinowski: I want to return to assault weapons ban we had in the 1990s.
@RepLanceNJ7 @Malinowski @Malinowski: I think corporate taxes needed to be lowered, but in a way that was fiscally responsible. 		Says we need to replace the current bill and replace with something that sparks investment, not incentivizes buybacks
@RepLanceNJ7 @Malinowski @Malinowski: I grew up in NJ, graduated from high school in the 7th congressional district. I left home to serve my country in the State Department. I live 10 minutes from where I grew up.		Adds that deep roots in NJ don't entitle anyone us to serve; must earn it.
@RepLanceNJ7 @Malinowski @Malinowski: It's a crazy and dangerous world out there and we have to control our borders. At the same time, this caravan is 1500 miles away from US, and if they reach American borders we have systems in place to hear out their asylum claims.
@RepLanceNJ7 @Malinowski @Malinowski says @RepLanceNJ7, contrary to Lance's claim, did not support Obama-era refugee admission when Obama was president.
@RepLanceNJ7 @Malinowski @RepLanceNJ7 calls @Malinowski a "carpetbagger" whose more liberal views do not represent those of the district.
@RepLanceNJ7 @Malinowski @RepLanceNJ7: I did not support Obamacare, although I favored some of its provisions, and I did not support the Republican proposal last year. 		Clarifies that what was advanced out of committee was a portion of the bill, and he voted against the bill on the floor.
@RepLanceNJ7 @Malinowski @RepLanceNJ7 says border security is not a matter for the American military.
@RepLanceNJ7 @Malinowski @RepLanceNJ7 says he would favor the refugee admission levels of the Obama administration, compared to Trump-era policy. "I think we should welcome refugees. I think that has been in the tradition of the United States and should continue in the tradition of the United States."

@WNYC @NPR @MaraLiasson @MaraLiasson: "If it's about border security, that's a good issue for him. If it's about how the president is failing in his job to be consoler-in-chief, that's a bad narrative for him. And this is a president who lives and dies by dominating the media narrative."
@WNYC @NPR @MaraLiasson @MaraLiasson: "This is something that's easy to find on right-wing media, that somehow Jews are responsible for illegal immigration."
@WNYC @NPR @MaraLiasson @MaraLiasson: It sounds like the pipe bomber was pretty typical--posting pictures of food, women, bodybuilding--but then all of a sudden in 2016, he starts to get political.
@WNYC @NPR @MaraLiasson We talk a lot about radicalization when we have a kind of lone-wolf Muslim shooter. Now we're going to talk about how right-wing shooters are radicalized, says @MaraLiasson.
@WNYC @NPR @MaraLiasson @MaraLiasson: "No, there's not going to be any kind of gun control measures coming out of this administration."
@WNYC @NPR @MaraLiasson Some in WH are frustrated that Trump doesn't want to play consoler-in-chief, others think he doesn't get enough credit for the unifying remarks he does make. Notes @MaraLiasson: because he often follows them up with jokes about being presidential or attacking political opponents.
Up now @WNYC, @NPR's @MaraLiasson reports on the latest national political news, including Pittsburgh synagogue attack, the investigation into the person suspected of mailing bombs to prominent Trump critics, and surveys the campaign landscape ahead of the midterm elections.

@WNYC @washingtonpost @NickMiroff @nytimes @anniecorreal Why travel in a massive group?		@anniecorreal: Sense that if you're part of such a large group, you're safer from gangs and protected from Mexican immigration authorities. Also avoids high cost of paying smuggler.

@marcmolinaro @WNYC .@marcmolinaro, on Reproductive Health Act: I do not believe there is consensus on late-term abortion.

@marcmolinaro @WNYC .@marcmolinaro adds that we should rely on law enforcement.		But, when pressed by Brian on equivalency bt Trump and Cuomo, Molinaro says there's a difference bt anger and being indignant.
@marcmolinaro @WNYC In light of explosives, how would you handle Trump's calls to violence?		@marcmolinaro: Leaders have to tone down the anger and make clear that we don't accept violence, hate, acts of terror.

Trump's biggest ethics breach? 		"The original sin of this Administration was that he did not divest his conflicting financial interest,"says @waltshaub "But I don't think people have a full appreciation for how dangerous that actually is."

@WhitfordBradley @letamericavote @WNYC (^speaking about the West Wing)
@WhitfordBradley @letamericavote @WNYC Does @WhitfordBradley worry that people will scoff at a bunch of Hollywood liberals telling voters what to do?		Yes, "but these are things that I believe in." Plus, he says, "we're not advocating for anything that will help us"; ie, their causes are not out of self-interest.
@WhitfordBradley @letamericavote @WNYC "The fakest thing about this show was that we had totally rational Republicans," says @WhitfordBradley.
@WhitfordBradley @letamericavote @WNYC .@WhitfordBradley says it's kind of a coincidence that he ends up in so many socially conscious projects (West Wing, Get Out, Handmaid's Tale).		"I'm proud of the fact that they're able to say something culturally important at the moment, but honestly I think it's just luck."
@WhitfordBradley @letamericavote @WNYC .@WhitfordBradley: "We have to hold two opposing thoughts. We must fight against this disenfranchisement, and we must get people out to vote and not lose faith in the system."
@WhitfordBradley @letamericavote @WNYC .@WhitfordBradley highlights disenfranchisement as an important issue facing us, but adds that we must acknowledge that it wasn't just voter disenfranchisement that made the left not show up in 2014.		"We must not despair and dissolve into 'the system is corrupt'."

@sarqari @Radiolab @WNYC A lot of people were upset during the Vietnam War that they could be drafted to fight, but not allowed to vote. It led to the slogan "Old enough to fight, old enough to vote," says @sarqari. The 26th Amendment was ratified as a result of that political pressure.

@katierogers @nytimes @WNYC .@katierogers: For all the goodwill work Melania Trump did on her Africa trip, her comments (including about Trump's reported s-hole countries statement) show that she's much more in line with him than people tend to want to believe. "She is no resistance figure."
@katierogers @nytimes @WNYC John Bolton and John Kelly reportedly had a screaming match yesterday.		@katierogers frames it within competing ideological forces within the WH and says the president is frustrated with his zero-tolerance policies not curbing border-crossing.
@katierogers @nytimes @WNYC Is "Mad Dog" Mattis on the ropes?		@katierogers says he has no detectable intention of leaving, but like many around POTUS has to walk a fine line. He's no dove, but he's also tried to take politics out of his job.

Joining now: @BorowitzReport on today's news.
@RBReich @WNYC .@RBReich: The old Republican party has been the party of capital, the old Democratic party--esp since the 1930s--has been the party of average workers. Trump has added more authoritarianism (vs democracy). That's the major split now, rather than capital vs labor.
@DGerowPR @RBReich @WNYC Check back here later! https://t.co/PBP04wlJUJ
@RBReich @WNYC .@RBReich: If we had a federal jobs program for people who couldn't otherwise find work, that would set a minimum standard with regard to private sector jobs. Says a job is an organizing principle; gives structure and meaning.
@RBReich @WNYC Labor unions used to be very powerful in this country, but now in the private sector fewer than 7% of private workers are unionized--a big reason the middle class has shrunk, says @RBReich.
@waltshaub Hi - we'd love to have you on for an interview. How can we connect?
@RBReich @WNYC .@RBReich: "A ban on stock buybacks makes a lot of sense."		Says buybacks hurt workers bc employers choose to raise stock value instead of worker pay, and most workers don't have much by way of stock. Says 80% of stock market is owned by richest 10% of Americans.
#30Issues continues! @RBReich joins to talk about the future of labor, should Democrats take the House. Tune in @WNYC.
@NYCMayor .@NYCMayor, on letters about voter status, some of which were sent in error: "There's no question that this was a good idea, whether there was a problem with the execution."		Says statistics he's seen show 8% of names should not have been on list, which means 92% should have.
@NYCMayor Under-the-weather @NYCMayor: "I'm your spokesmodel today that you've gotta take care of yourself...It's a good time to get ahead of the flu."

@SenSanders “I look to the states to play a leadership role” on single-payer, @SenSanders says. But, he continues, ultimately we need to pass that legislation in Washington and elect progressives to the House, Senate, and White House.
@SenSanders .@SenSanders: “We have more than enough money to pay for #MedicareForAll because we’re spending so much right now.”
@SenSanders Sen Claire McCaskill is running heavily on healthcare, preexisting conditions coverage, but she does not support #MedicareForAll.		@SenSanders: “I hope very much that she wins because I’d like to see Democrats regain control.” Says she'll run on what she thinks works in Missouri.
@SenSanders “The idea that we would threaten hospitals is absurd,” says @SenSanders. Under current system, he says, you already see a great deal of stress on hospitals in rural areas. Says a #MedicareForAll system would be about “rational expenditures.”
@SenSanders .@SenSanders: “The current system is incredibly bureaucratic, incredibly wasteful.” He cites billing, exorbitant profits in the insurance and pharmaceutical industries.
@SenSanders .@SenSanders says his opponents always claim that he wants to raise your taxes but they seem to forget, he says, “Bernie Sanders wants to do away with all of the private health insurance premiums that you are paying, do away with the deductibles and copayments you are paying.”
@SenSanders @SenSanders says, despite the fact that so many people are uninsured or under-insured, despite the fact that we pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, we spend twice as much per capita on healthcare as people of any other nation.
@SenSanders .@SenSanders: "There are millions of people in this country...who are at their jobs, not because they enjoy their jobs, but because their employer is providing decent quality health insurance."

@washingtonpost @MaxBoot @WNYC .@MaxBoot: Nobody is suggesting we have to abandon Saudi Arabia. But we need to hold MBS accountable for this monstrous crime.
@washingtonpost @MaxBoot @WNYC .@MaxBoot calls Trump's reaction to the Jamal Khashoggi news "appalling." He gets worked up about Canadian milk, but he doesn't seem to give a damn about our allies apparently torturing, murdering, and dismembering an American resident.

@WNYC @lizzwinstead @LadyPJustice .@lizzwinstead: Basically we live in a country where bad politicians happen to good people. We have to remember there's a line between the people there and the creeps who get elected because people don't show up.
@WNYC @lizzwinstead .@lizzwinstead says The Golden Probes, from @LadyPJustice, highlights those politicians who have dedicated their careers to eroding the reproductive rights of women.		For more about "sexism's most glamorous night":	https://t.co/JqkFkkGu3l
Now @WNYC: @lizzwinstead with a comedic take on the news and talks about her upcoming satirical awards show, The Golden Probes.
@WNYC @zchace @ThisAmerLife .@zchace: Is there a constituency of voters who would want to see someone like a big Trump critic but still has conservative views? "I don't know if there is, just from looking at Flake."
@WNYC @zchace @ThisAmerLife .@zchace on Jeff Flake: "Even though he talks like someone who's mad at, Trump because he is, he votes like someone who's a longtime, lifelong conservative Republican, which he is."
@WNYC @zchace @ThisAmerLife .@zchace: It's odd that a lot of Democrats think that, just because Jeff Flake is calling for a pause in intense fighting over rhetoric in our politics, that he is also gonna vote with them--because he definitely isn't.
@WNYC @zchace @ThisAmerLife .@zchace says Jeff Flake was truly undecided about Kavanaugh and made up his mind in front of the whole country.
@WNYC @zchace @ThisAmerLife .@zchace thought she was done with her story on Jeff Flake, but as the Kavanaugh hearing was heating up and Flake was "torturedly ambivalent", she called him up and said, can I hang out with you while you figure this out
Up now @WNYC! @zchace, producer @ThisAmerLife, talks about her experience following and reporting on Senator Jeff Flake, and what she learned about partisan politics and celebrity.
@BenSasse .@BenSasse: Right vs Left is important right now, but much more important is "past vs future". Neither party has a long-term plan.
@BenSasse .@BenSasse: Whether people like Sean Hannity or not, they need to realize that he's really good at "nut-picking", finding "some jerk somewhere on the political spectrum doing something crazy" and portraying them as representative of the opposing party.
@BenSasse .@BenSasse: "Knowing the person who lives two doors down is correlated with happiness. More social media friends isn't."
@BenSasse .@BenSasse: Technological advances allow us to become rootless. People are happier when they're rooted.
@BenSasse .@BenSasse: "We need to distinguish between good tribes and bad tribes." Political tribalism is a bad thing. Need to use tribe to talk about family, friendship, shared  vocation, &amp; worship communities.
And now... @BenSasse argues that loneliness is the underlying cause of America's extreme polarization and the solution lies in finding deepening rootedness in his new book, "Them".
@RepJerryNadler @WNYC .@RepJerryNadler: Police are effective when they work with the communities they are policing. If they are seen as a "foreign occupied army", you get more hostility and friction, and probably more people killed. We should curtail military equip for police.
@RepJerryNadler @WNYC .@RepJerryNadler: The criminal justice reform bill will "hopefully" allow for rehabilitated prisoners to earn much more time off, provide proper training to prepare prisoners to reenter society, &amp; allow retroactive sentencing reform.
@RepJerryNadler @WNYC Mass incarceration is largely a state problem, but @RepJerryNadler says the federal government can lead the way, by changing laws and allowing states to liberalize their laws.
@RepJerryNadler @WNYC .@RepJerryNadler: "The major effect of the war on drugs has been to fill our prisons with huge numbers of people to no great effect except to waste money and to ruin lives."

@kalhartp @TheDemocrats Listeners, do you care about infrastructure? (note: if you complain about subways, you're talking about infrastructure) 		What plan do you want to see? Would this be a voting issue for you? Call 212-433-WNYC.
@kalhartp @TheDemocrats .@kalhartp: The plan Schumer put forward would pay for $1 trillion investment by repealing the biggest tax cuts Republicans passed on wealthiest Americans and corporations
Now for #30Issues: Infrastructure, one of Trump's few claims to bipartisanship... which has now fallen off the map. 		So if Democrats take the House, what's their plan?		@kalhartp, policy director for @TheDemocrats, joins.
@wendyzuk @MerylEHorn @sciencevs @WNYC .@MerylEHorn: Because we found that these calls (Cornerstore Caroline, et al) are rising more in gentrifying neighborhoods, it does suggest that there's some phenomenon underlying them.

@wendyzuk @MerylEHorn @sciencevs @WNYC .@MerylEHorn says longtime residents seem more likely to work things out on their own, rather than call cops
@wendyzuk @MerylEHorn @sciencevs @WNYC .@wendyzuk says we don't have data to show that rich people are generally quieter, but does seem that they have better relationships with law enforcement and are more comfortable calling on all sorts of things
@wendyzuk @MerylEHorn @sciencevs @WNYC The @sciencevs team says research shows that, yes, neighborhoods are changing, but it's more due to people new coming in rather than a forced mass exodus.
Now: @wendyzuk (left) &amp; @MerylEHorn (right) of @sciencevs talk about the 311 data they analyzed to find out whether increased noise complaints really do go hand-in-hand with rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods. Tune in @WNYC https://t.co/7BiKiDwUha
@peterbakernyt @WNYC .@peterbakernyt says #MeToo is tribal: nearly as many Republican women believed Kavanaugh as R men, and nearly as many Democratic men believe Blasey Ford as D women. "The divide among men and women wasn't really a divide among men and women," except in case of Independents.
@peterbakernyt @WNYC .@peterbakernyt: There hasn't been much enthusiasm on the part of either party, except for making political points, for taking a serious audit of the system and protecting it from domestic or foreign interference.
@peterbakernyt @WNYC Caller says she's fearful of Democrats jumping straight into impeachment because it would play to Trump's strength of portraying himself as victim.

@RepEspaillat @WNYC Caller calls #AbolishICE "political lunacy," implores different, safer tactic.		@RepEspaillat: Our message should be that DREAMERS who are doctors, members of armed forces should be given shot to stay in nation. Our message should be that families should not be separated.
@RepEspaillat @WNYC Are Democrats for open borders, as opponents claim?		@RepEspaillat: Our nation has a long-standing tradition of welcoming people seeking asylum, w due process, and we should not change that tradition. In favor of strengthening ports of entry.
@RepEspaillat @WNYC .@RepEspaillat expresses support for #AbolishIce: "We should have a law enforcement agency" that enforces immigration laws "with heart." Not concerned that it is a losing position for Democrats, though depends on how issue is framed.

@jangelooff @WNYC Caller Dan, retired from NYPD, says NYPD is told not to take individual action at demonstrations unless necessary, bc of right to assembly, &amp; scene developed rapidly. Mentions Antifa is not labelled "left-wing" group, and claims spray-painting protesters were looking for trouble.
@jangelooff @WNYC Caller JD claims he witnessed the fight, calls event and police response "so bizarre." Says he spoke to the police on-scene and called their handling "embarrassing." But did not suggest, as others are, that NYPD officers were sympathetic to Proud Boy ideology.
@jangelooff @WNYC Listeners, were you near Friday's incident? Did you witness--or participate in?--any of this? Call 212-433-9692.
@jangelooff @WNYC In video, you can hear "Western chauvinist" Proud Boys chanting "I like beer" in apparent reference to Brett Kavanaugh. McInnes has said before that women should not hold jobs, should be child-rearing and stay in the kitchen, says @jangelooff.
@jangelooff @WNYC We don't know who started the fight on Friday, but it is clear from video that it's something like a "30 on 2" mob, with protesters outnumbered, says @jangelooff.
@jangelooff @WNYC Why was Gavin McInnes, Proud Boys founder, even featured at the seemingly staid Metropolitan Republic Club?		Board Chairman said he is part of the right, and they have all sorts of speakers there.

@pbump @WNYC @washingtonpost .@pbump: There is a long tradition of using war, boxing, violence analogies in politics. Important to realize now though that there is mostly bad-faith effort to promote violent Democratic "mob" idea &amp; reinforce Trump's 2016 promises to push back on crime and violence.
@pbump @WNYC @washingtonpost [cont] @pbump framed this within the various standards of proof that Trump demands: Warren, his political opponent, must take a DNA test to prove her ancestry; meanwhile, this morning, he broadcasts Saudi King Salman's denials of culpability in Jamal Khashoggi's disappearance
@pbump @WNYC @washingtonpost Elizabeth Warren--after Trump offered that "if you take the test and it shows you’re an Indian" he would donate $1 million to her favorite charity--has taken a DNA test which provides evidence of her Native American heritage.
@pbump @WNYC @washingtonpost .@pbump says he's impressed by the ability of his colleagues @washingtonpost to compartmentalize emotions about Jamal Khashoggi and continue to look and write objectively about what happened to him.
@pbump @WNYC @washingtonpost .@pbump: Presidential approval is based on a lot more than economic success, though Trump would like to tie the two of them together.

@noamscheiber @nytimes @WNYC Caller David in Stamford, current DOJ employee, says with Trump campaigning on 'Drain the Swamp' foregoing pay raises comes off as victory for him, even among recipients of financial consequences.
@noamscheiber @nytimes @WNYC Interesting about Trump's executive orders limiting job security protection &amp; union power is that they're written in a "clever way" that avoids mandating any changes. So difficult to prove whether agency management are making changes bc POTUS told them to, or bc they want to.
@noamscheiber @nytimes @WNYC What's behind Trump's move to forego pay raises?		It can dovetail with long-term Trump and Trump-ally goals, such as the privatization of social security, while also sticking it to bureaucratic opponents in short term.

@WNYC @CoralMDavenport If we warm past 2.7 degrees, we are going to see an unlocking of methane, which @CoralMDavenport says will lead to a "feedback loop": warming releases methane, increases warming, releases more methane, etc.

Question from audience member on Canadian healthcare ... Harper points out: "One of the strengths of the American system that should never be forgotten is virtually all health innovation occurs in this country."
Brian asks Harper to react to Trump policy to cut cap on refugees. Harper: "Where illegal or irregular immigration comes to dominate, public support for all types of immigration ... falls dramatically." He suggests America and others should tackle illegal immigration.
Harper answers this question: "That was far from being my policy ... We ran the largest per capita immigration program in the world." https://t.co/VfJCR7j5OW
On Canadian refugee policy: "Canada accepts tens of thousands of refugees a year, and that's, you know, I think that's generous ... it's still a small number compared to the refugee problem."
Though he is a free-market person, Harper adds that he is "a strong believer that you need sound financial regulation for the long-term viability of the economy."
On financial regulation, Harper says there are only about five or six large banks in Canada. "Frankly, the execution of the regulatory environment is a much simpler process in Canada than it is in the United States."
Now on air: We continue our conversation with former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen J. Harper. https://t.co/ck1BwiMTcT
On the question of "jihadist terrorism," @DMiliband says: "It's a terrible mistake of foreign policy to blame a population for their own government or the rebel group that's incubated in their own country."
Caller Linda talks to recent Russian immigrants in her own community who are anti-immigrant. "They just got here! It boggles my mind!" she says. "Can that be explained in any way?"
Caller Anthony sees unfairness in watching refugees and immigrants building new lives in America while he sees black Americans suffering (turned down for loans in his own family, for example). But he still doesn't want to bar refugees from the country.
.@DMiliband: Turkey, Jordan, Bangladesh "Those countries don't know whether to laugh or cry when they hear Americans saying, 'Oh, it's a crisis to have 10 or 20,000 people arrive' because these are countries that have hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people arriving."

"One of the hallmarks of the Trump era," Kai Wright says, is "it sort of began with people who were terrified of his presidency saying 'Our institutions will save us' ... and it's arrived at a place where people are like, 'Well maybe our institutions are the problem.'"
In New Jersey congressional races, @NancySolomon2 says: "The level of engagement and activism among middle-aged, middle class, educated white women in these two districts, the 7th and the 11th, is like nothing I have ever seen in my career as a reporter in 30 years."
.@kai_wright: in blaming Democrats for the leak, Republicans had a lot of "success in creating a villain that was not Christine Blasey Ford."
First comment and question from guest at the Greene Space on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford ... "Somebody in the Democrat party decided her privacy wasn't worth it and they leaked it to the press." How did that happen?

Polling in NJ's 11th District suggests that Kavanaugh is "just shoring up the base," Solomon says.		"If you were full-on Republican, you think it was right to confirm Kavanaugh. If you're full-on Democrat, you think it was a huge mistake and a travesty."
"He may be the last man standing of the moderate wing of the Republican party ... in the state," @NancySolomon2 says of Rep. Leonard Lance
Nancy Solomon now explaining how the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh has seeped into the race in New Jersey's 7th District.

.@BeschlossDC: Though president's will have policy not everyone likes, "Every president from George Washington through Donald Trump's predecessor has known that an equally important part of the president's job is to keep this fractious nation mended together to try to unite us."
@BeschlossDC .@BeschlossDC adds that if Trump wanted to declare war tomorrow, there would be very little to stop him, especially now with a 5-4 Supreme Court majority.
.@BeschlossDC reminds how rare it is for an American president to ask Congress for permission to declare war, even though that power of Congress is constitutional: 		"When was the last time Congress declared war? It was 1942, if you can believe it." https://t.co/phyMGb1J8S
Now: @BeschlossDC talks about his new book, "Presidents of War"
@MortonAKlein7 Mouin Rabbani: Haley proved to be "extraordinarily vulgar" on Israel &amp; Palestine; was a faithful representative for Trump administration		.@Jane_Eisner: She has been the "darling" of those who agree with Trump's strategy
.@MortonAKlein7 says Nikki Haley's resignation is a great loss for strong US-Israel relations. "She has told the whole truth, no matter what the truth was, with tremendous courage."
@Jane_Eisner .@MortonAKlein7 (pictured): premise is that Israelis refuse to make peace and Arabs want peace, but Arabs are the ones who won't negotiate and promote violence https://t.co/CtTlEqReSS
On BDS:		.@Jane_Eisner (pictured): not a supporter, not in favor of academic boycotts &amp; goal is fuzzy, but it's a nonviolent attempt we need to engage		Rabbani: demonstrably peaceful form of resistance; interesting that people want to criminalize it https://t.co/zoCXukSgGI
Mouin Rabbani: Trump administration has gone begone traditional embrace to "uncritical and unconditional embrace of the extreme Israeli right" and conform to idea that Palestinian rights don't exist. What's being proposed to Palestinians: "submit or starve"
There's a Betsy DeVos angle to the Kavanaugh story: When the alleged assault happened he was the same age as the YAs who will be affected by Devos' new policies on how schools should handle sexual misconduct. 	https://t.co/ubNdmFpl1M
.@Jane_Eisner: "I don't know what the Trump administration policy is. I'm not sure that [Trump] does... We are no closer to any peace deal than we are to a deal with North Korea or the Mexican wall." +White Christian evangelicals are the ones pushing policy to move embassy.
.@MortonAKlein7: For 25 years America has ignored that "the Palestinian authority is promoting hatred and violence in every aspect of their culture... so finally this administration is saying, enough is enough...hopeful" that this will move Palestinian authority to peace.
Now #30Issues continues @WNYC... Today: the Trump administration's policy changes regarding Israel and Palestine. @Jane_Eisner of @jdforward, @MortonAKlein7 of @ZOA_National, &amp; Mouin Rabbani of @PalStudies debate.
"Many people have come to the conclusion that democracy is a synonym for weakness." -- @BrazilBrian
Bolsonaro has not moderated his rhetoric; said criminals are not human beings, a policeman who doesn't kill is not a policeman. Brazilians know what they're voting for and you can't overstate the support Bolsonaro has, says @BrazilBrian.
.@BrazilBrian says Bolsonaro notoriously said certain Afro-Brazilian communities 'aren't even good for breeding anymore.' Winter notes that in Brazil, people who identify as of African descent account for &gt;50% of population.

.@emilybazelon: Collins made a big deal about condemning the person who leaked Blasey Ford's letter. Blasey Ford herself has never condemned the leaking. All of Collins' finger pointing... it seems like she was the one who didn't want letter to become public.
Caller says he did not use to be Trump supporter but is now. "If he gets nothing accomplished, he prevented Hillary Clinton from getting into office and making the composition of the Supreme Court even farther left."

.@emilybazelon: "I think that Blasey Ford is telling the truth." None of the risk factors for a false accusation were in play here. To me that mattered quite a lot. Obviously it did not to Susan Collins.

From today's show, here's Tracy K Smith reading a poem from her new collection, "American Journal." https://t.co/ll2w2bCINT
@WNYC Tracy K Smith: Poems that may not have been written in this moment can be useful for crossing divides, talking about love, loss, fear, and family.
@WNYC Tracy K Smith explains that she chose to do a collection of work from other poets because when she's on the road, she likes to be able to celebrate and experience a poem from the perspective of a reader, along with the audience.
Up now: US Poet Laureate Tracy K Smith talks about her new collection of poetry "American Journal: Fifty Poems for Our Time." Listen @WNYC.
@WNYC @AnnaMKaplan Michele Sterlace-Accorsi: We see abortion as a tool of oppression rather than empowerment. 		Brian: The law giving the choice to women is a form of oppression?		Sterlace-Accorsi: To think women need opportunity to discard life as they sit fit as form of equality is misplaced.
@WNYC @AnnaMKaplan .@AnnaMKaplan tells the story of a woman who had to leave the state to abort her child, whose life she knew would not be viable. 		Says opponents of Reproductive Health Act are reading bill incorrectly and putting fear in people.
@WNYC @AnnaMKaplan Michele Sterlace-Accorsi: NYS has highest abortion rate of any state. Reproductive Health Act is not s simple codification of Roe. Not only about removing abortion from penal code. Re-victimizes victims of sex trafficking and domestic violence. Disregards unborn human life.
@WNYC @AnnaMKaplan .@AnnaMKaplan: This bill codifies Roe, removes abortion from criminal code, and allows the administration of non-surgery abortion, and abortions after 24 weeks if pregnancy is non-viable or mother's health is at risk.
30 Issues time! On @WNYC, @AnnaMKaplan &amp; Michele Sterlace-Accorsi (Executive Director of Feminists Choosing Life of New York) debate whether New York should pass the Reproductive Health Act, a measure that would allow for late term abortion in the state.
@annehelen @WNYC .@annehelen: (cont'd) No matter what, there's going to be dissatisfaction with the process, and a feeling that Republicans do not take sexual assault seriously.
@annehelen @WNYC .@annehelen: It's significant that they're not taking testimony from Deborah Ramirez. Whatever the Senate Republicans are considering, it's not going to be the full picture of the allegations against Kavanaugh.
@annehelen @WNYC .@annehelen calls feminism "the radical idea that women are people and thus deserves the rights that accompany personhood"
@annehelen @WNYC .@annehelen: The work of #metoo is delving into some of these more complex questions, going into the grey areas and talking about it. That shows we are moving forward, not that #metoo is failing.

@PeteforNy .@CPopeHC: Healthcare is a right, but the question is who pays for it and how much does everyone pay? Would likely cost more than Rand study suggests.
.@PeteforNy: Cuomo said single player should at least be explored, but that Republicans won't take up issue for debate is "unconscionable." Plus, if we want to get serious about mental health and substance abuse, we need better coverage.

Jill Lepore pegs the 1930s as the first time "Fake News" was used: Joseph Goebbels used the radio to tell the German people what to think and sent out richly produced false news reports. Newspapers in England and US called it fake news.
Throughout history, new technology has always introduced equilibrium and required adjustment. But today, new technology has automated partisanship and we can't figure out to fix it. -- Jill Lepore

What did the founding fathers mean by "happiness"?		Jill Lepore: Happiness wasn't exactly an emotional state in the 18th century--it was almost religious. It's not what we would think of as attending to personal needs or having the new iPhone. It's more about the commonweal. https://t.co/dfQdXvc9ph

Caller Q: Will you raise the number of affordable housing units for homeless people?		@NYCMayor: The issue of homelessness is not as simple of moving the homeless into homes. The best approach moving forward is preventative measures, like raising the minimum wage.
Spoken like a true politician and a New Yorker on the last day of Summer, @NYCMayor says he loves all four seasons, has no favorite, welcomes fall, and says a fond goodbye to Summer.

Brian points out for the record: A listener says earlier audio from Sen. Heflin (https://t.co/CmcYGDWrSo) was likely sarcastic; Heflin was an Alabama Democrat and on Hill's side.
Brian asks: Would you expect questioning of Kavanaugh's legal opinion - on Roe v. Wade particularly - in light of this accusation?		@kzernike: Yes and "I think it goes beyond abortion to a woman's autonomy over her own body."
Listener John in Monroe, NY: "Why would anybody go through what she's going through, to lie? What would be her motive?" 		Kate Zernike: There have been some cases of false accusations (at Duke, for example) "There's still this notion that women are crazy and can't be trusted."
Question from listener Peter in Walden, NY: Why do they need the extra time [to investigate]? I don't get it. 		Kate Zernike: Seems logical that the FBI should look into it, but "time is huge here" with the midterms looming.
Question from listener Juliet from Yorktown Heights: How is the young man who was present with Kavanaugh during the alleged assault "getting away" with not testifying?
"There is still a sense of the burden of proof being on the accuser as opposed to the accused ... That's something that has not changed since Anita Hill." -@kzernike		Tune in on 93.9 FM or here: https://t.co/iIaEjwzK5y
"This is all being done against the backdrop of the midterms," Kate Zernike says of the Kavanaugh controversy. After the 1991 hearings, a record number of women ran for office.
Phones are open for questions and comments on the Kavanaugh hearing, or reflections on 1991: 212-433-9692 (or tweet at us!)
@kzernike Zernike: "Remember, it was — the questioning and the harsh questioning — was not just Republicans. It was Democrats casting doubt on her ... as well."
"Are you a scorned woman?"		— Sen. Howell Heflin questions Anita Hill in 1991. Archival audio on air now as conversation gets underway with New York Times political reporter Kate Zernike (@kzernike)

NYC supports worker cooperatives -- the first city across the country to do this, says @nycworker's Saduf Syal. These worker cooperatives are more likely to be led by women, people of color &amp; immigrant communities, who turn to it for collective ownership + generating jobs.
Listeners, do you have any co-op experience -- residential, business or another kind? If so, give us a call at 212-433-9692.
Cooperatives are actually everywhere, says @ntnsndr. More than one third of Americans are members of credit unions, for example. Land o' Lakes butter is a farmer cooperative. The Associated Press is a cooperative of news agencies. "This model is everywhere," says @ntnsndr.
Now: @Duartegeraldino talks to @ntnsndr + @nycworker's Saduf Syal as they make the case for cooperative businesses -- tune in now @WNYC.
@DrIbram says "in order to treat some people equally, we must treat them differently...it's hard to create equity without figuring out ways to repair the past."
Listeners, call with any questions for @DrIbram on racism, anti-racism and the historical context of America's racial divisions: 212-433-9692.
Now: @DrIbram makes a case that our nation is divided between racism and anti-racism. Tune in @WNYC.
@ClaraHemphill says one solution she'd like to see is more seats at the specialized high schools -- like at Queens High School for the Sciences -- which currently only has 500 students.
@madinatoure says after the November elections, there will be some new faces in the State Senate - so what does that mean for the mayor's specialized high school plan?

Yes, the podcast should be in your feed in a just a few minutes... https://t.co/5P04KWt9CQ
Coming up next: @ClaraHemphill + @madinatoure talk specialized high schools + the changes that may be coming to them. Tune in @WNYC.
@Kassandra_Fred: "Drug use is a part of our lives, it has always been a part of every society...we have to have a conversation, and take a responsibility for that. That means everyone should know how to reverse an overdose."
@Kassandra_Fred says rhetoric around the overdose crisis has emphasized a compassionate approach, but policy hasn't caught up -- people are still getting arrested, there's been a huge investment in narcotics policing.
As people in NYC talked about the overdose crisis and overdose deaths, people talked about Staten Island - but when you look at rate vs. number, we've known for a while the Bronx was always losing more people, says @Kassandra_Fred.
@Kassandra_Fred says the overdose rate went up 25% in the past year for people in the highest poverty neighborhoods; she says that means resource distribution is not as effective as it should be.
Now: @Duartegeraldino is in the host chair, with his first guest, @Kassandra_Fred from the @DrugPolicyOrg on rising overdoses in NYC (esp. in the South Bronx). Tune in @WNYC.
Morning all! @Duartegeraldino hosts today -- joining him will be @DrugPolicyOrg's @Kassandra_Fred; then @madinatoure + @ClaraHemphill talk SHSAT; @DrIbram; @ntnsndr + @nycworker's Saduf Syal on worker coops. Tune in at 10 @WNYC.

@brakktonbooker says in some parts of NC they've gotten more than 2 feet of rain (!). In Wilmington, there is one singular road in and out of the city, but it's not quite secure. So folks who have evacuated should stay away so emergency vehicles can use it.
Now: @brakktonbooker updates us on Hurricane Florence and its disastrous aftermath in North Carolina -- listeners with connections to the area, give us a call and tell us how you or your friends/family are faring: 212-433-9692.
@DorisKGoodwin reminds us how much of a master LBJ was at working with the Congress to pass legislation (esp. the Civil Rights Act) - she doesn't think JFK could have gotten this done (or anyone else, really).
A caller says he heard back in Teddy Roosevelt's day, you used to have to pay the political boss to get a promotion within the NYPD. @DorisKGoodwin says the caller is right; Roosevelt changed it to make promotions merit-based.
@DorisKGoodwin says leaders like FDR, Lincoln and LBJ were able to use divisions and ferment, to pull us together and come out stronger.
Next: @DorisKGoodwin draws on her deep knowledge of presidents to talk about what makes a good leader in a crisis. Tune in @WNYC.
@A_W_Gordon says he doesn't think Cuomo or Nixon really had a good plan to fix the MTA, but Molinaro, the Rep candidate for gov, has a decent plan + he says he actually does try to wrestle with the elements that make the MTA the "bureaucratic nightmare" that it is.
Listeners who voted in the NYS primary last week, how much was transit on your mind when you voted?
@A_W_Gordon says a lot of ppl are looking forward to this NYS budgetary season as the first time there's a comprehensive picture (and the aforementioned Byford plan) - so the question is, what will Cuomo do?
John Raskin says there is no substitute for a long-term solution that involves investment in infrastructure. Andy Byford's plan has this -- "the question is whether money will be there to make the plan possible." @RidersNY
Now: @RidersNY exec director John Raskin (l) &amp; @A_W_Gordon (r) talk subway problems (there were issues EVERY DAY in August except ONE). https://t.co/QWMDiHFXLe
@eschor: "It is interesting to me that we may finally be seeing the left awakening to why they should fight about judicial openings."
@eschor says it's is definitely a McConnell priority to remake the federal judiciary, and he is very good at it. But one of the bigger narratives is the absolute politicization of the independent judiciary.
@eschor says to most Senators, what matters is Kavanaugh is denying he did this right now. But she does believe that if a significant number of moderate Republicans wind up believing Dr. Ford, "his nomination is done for."
@eschor points out that Dr. Ford, the woman who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, hasn't yet agreed to testify on Monday.
Listeners: call with your question for @eschor on what's happening with the Kavanaugh nomination: 212-433-9692.

Peter Wallison acknowledges that a lot of people LIKE what our administrative agencies, like the EPA, are doing -but that's not democratic. He points out the employees there are not elected.
The problem with authorization to the EPA is that it's "extremely open-ended." It means regulators have all the power to decide who pays, who bears the burdens - Congress should decide this, says Peter Wallison. https://t.co/EhGLsPEChc
Peter Wallison: "We have to preserve our democracy, where the rules are made by Congress...it's not an anti-regulation position." But "we should not consider regulation to be an unalloyed good."
Now: @AEIecon senior fellow Peter Wallison argues that the executive branch has encroached on Congressional powers -- leading to  "the administrative state." Tune in @WNYC.
@DLeonhardt says what we have is: stagnant or slow-growing incomes for the majority and rapidly growing incomes for the small subset at the top. Call to share your story or questions: 212-433-9692.
We see all kinds of ways the aftereffects of the financial crisis are still with us - leading @DLeonhardt to question our economic indicators.

Our @jamifloyd commenting on one reason she believes the accusation against Kavanaugh is credible: the women told her therapist + husband about it years ago, well before Judge Kavanaugh was a Supreme Court nominee.
"It's so incredibly hard to vote in New York...people magically fall off the roles all the time," says @GloriaPazmino.
Susan Lerner says if anyone had issues voting last week, to please email nyoffice@commoncause.org and they will try to get to the bottom of it.
@GloriaPazmino argues the Felder race mostly flew under the radar. "He has a lot of support, and his supporters are willing to vote for him almost no matter what." This means it was a v. different race than the other challenged State Senate seats.
Give us a call with any questions for our guests on reforms to our voting system, + more analysis of last week's NYS primary, with @commoncauseny's Susan Lerner + @GloriaPazmino -- 212-433-9692.
Polling places on primary day upstate don't open until NOON, says Susan Lerner. Why is that, Brian asks? "Oh it's the legislature." It's the political parties and the incumbents against the voters.
"We are the only state in the union that cannot get our act together to hold one primary" - for state and federal elections, says Susan Lerner of @commoncauseny. https://t.co/Ym0CYlJzyH
Susan Lerner reminds us that "New York's election laws make it unusually difficult for eligible voters to get to the polls and cast a ballot that will count." Says @commoncauseny got reports of problems voting.
On Cuomo downplaying the anti-IDC winners in last week's primary, @GloriaPazmino says he's not wrong -- for Dems to take power in the State Senate, they really need to flip some Republican seats to Dem in November. Notes "Simcha Felder factor..."
Now: Susan Lerner, exec director of @commoncauseny + @GloriaPazmino talk about needed reforms to NYS elections + now that the primary is done, they'll discuss who will actually be on your ballots in November (+ how that'll affect the balance of power in the NYS Senate).
@SusanPage on this accusation against Kavanaugh: his nomination is now in some peril; there's already talk in GOP circles that he may be forced to withdraw his name.
@SusanPage says the Senate Judiciary Committee vote on Kavanaugh, scheduled for Thursday, is still on as of now, but she says it now seems unlikely that it's going to happen.
