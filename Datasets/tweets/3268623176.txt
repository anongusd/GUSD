@mookiemueller @Dax_x98 @GoldenRule617 Thank you. Although I believe in him as my savior many do not. I'm okay with that. What I'm not okay with is the fact that there is proof he was a real man. People just forget about facts can you serve their own purpose.

At the same when you start having a honest conversation about how you grew up and how ugly racism occurred around it. We were just fortunate enough to grow up in a family that taught us how ugly it was. Shame people start telling you how you feel and what your experiences were.
I never once said what she accused me of saying. If I offended you my apologies. We were all having a great conversation about how about racism in our lives has shown its ugly face. And we were fortunate enough to be brought up in families that taught us how ugly it really was.

@madnessIImethod Then that's when it's going to be subpoenaed. And unless you've been through this before you have no idea what you're about to go through. If you think the investigation was hard wait. I live through Watergate and everything that they got they had to fight for.
@madnessIImethod No no, I'm going by what he said. If you go back to his testimony during his confirmation he said that little or no information is normally the way the FBI deals with things. And if he only allows part of the report in instead of just redacting National Security secrets and names

@LibertyPhysics @EdKrassen By the way I guess I should tell you, I worked for national stillbirth Society
@LibertyPhysics @EdKrassen According to studies between 2003 and 2005,¬†20¬†to 35 % of babies born at¬†23 weeks¬†of gestation survive, while 50 to 70% of babies born at¬†24¬†to¬†25 weeks, and more than 90 % born at¬†26¬†to¬†27 weeks, survive. It is rare for a baby weighing less than 500g  to survive
You are incorrect. Death of mothers and babies are higher in this country than other developed countries. You should check your statistics and babies do not survive. Only 20 to 30% of babies born at 23 weeks will even survive. Ask my sister! 22 weeks and we buried the little girl https://t.co/nyoU4Pro5Y
The only thing that bothers me about the other countries trusting China or Russia, what happened to over three-quarters of the century that we were leaders and this is only temporary with Trump, just like all of our other presidents are only temporary.	#TrumpIsTemporary

@EdKrassen I can guarantee that some babies born at full-term don't survive. We are one of the worst of mother and infant deaths in the world. And considering men have not worked hard enough to even saw that. Why in the hell would I want them to make a medical decision over my body.
@Bornabrit1 I agree with you 100%. We have three credible lifetime Republicans that have look into Donald Trump working on behalf of. Russia and Putin. I'll take these three lifetime law enforcement agents over Aline piece of shit like Trump. Trump is worse than Nixon and all of his schemes.
McCabe had every right to do what he did. Watergate took over 2 years to investigate and get the report. You and your dealings with Russia or much worse. And no matter how long it takes, we The People will find out, and make sure you pay for your crimes.	#YoureACrook https://t.co/fjU4qB7FSi

@realDonaldTrump @NBCNews Stop your bitching. You dumb f*** if you knew anything you'd know that Watergate took over 2 years. And yours is a hell of a lot worse than Watergate. Which I never thought I would have to say. When Watergate having it was the worst thing to this country that we what would happen
@realDonaldTrump Then if that is the case I want to fire you. Because you do nothing but lie constantly and we have proof. You're also a dumbass and deserve to be removed.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends No it wasn't. You need to read our Constitution and know that what they did was legal and needed. We all know that your loyalties lot with Putin and you have been trying to obstruct this investigation since day one.
We got through Nixon and now we're getting through Trump. What's going to happen 20 years from now? Well that president be even worse than Trump. Seems like we have to keep learning the same lessons over and over again.	#StopCorruption 	#BeenHereBefore

Again, your rights which are Liberties that you are given. Can be taken away and given back to you. If a person goes to jail they lose their rights.

Let's be honest when it comes down to it if no one had guns no, no one would need them. And is much as I love to go out and shoot guns with the best of them. But unless it's for hunting it's just not necessary. I rather give up my guns so someone else could live. https://t.co/o2YEwkubrr
@thunderman115 And can't always track down the people. Sometimes they're just hard to find. And he should have had a probation or parole officer that also should have been notified. A lot of people messed up but what it comes down to is they didn't pull the trigger.
@thunderman115 You're blaming everyone but the criminal. And he should have never been sold it in the first place I agree there. When it comes to the police confiscating it I think you need to find out what the policies are once they're reported on the list. Most police are underfunded.

And if you listen to Trump and Pence when Obama did try to do something regarding the Border as a national emergency oh, it was turned down and they made speeches against it.
@SenSchumer @funder @realDonaldTrump These things have got to stop. His over-reach is getting out of hand and his ignorance of the Constitution is inexcusable.

@KamalaHarris Everyone should be a against him declaring a National Emergency when they're really isn't.
@SenKamalaHarris Just reminded me of Schoolhouse Rock. And how a bill is made.
To those Federal contractors that are going without pay. You can all think Trump. They put it in the bill but Trump blocked it. Make sure you remember that during the 2020 election.
@SheilaGinHB @Kokomothegreat The answers are hilarious.

What is wrong with our government we've had two people in Congress get shot Gabby Gifford in the head and Steve Scalise in the hip and we still have those in Congress that will not go for Universal background checks. God forbid anything happened to them or their families.

@AOC @sunrisemvmt You people that complain about this deal, must not care if they live or die, or their family does. I want to do every single thing I have to. Arizona needs to go 100% solar. There is no excuse. Big business is stopping this state from having free electricity.
@Bestearthpic1 @AntoniaSchmitt4 It's our only Earth and we're treating it like we have a spare.
@KamalaHarris As soon as you figure out a way for that to happen let me know. Being on disability Social Security, you don't make enough to even live. All those wonderful entitlement programs that the wealthy want to cut. Those programs make up less than 2% of our national budget.

@KamalaHarris I grew up in Illinois, knowing what knee high by the 4th of July meant. And now live in Arizona. I support you and the policies you support. Not all midwestern's go for a candidate from the Midwest.
I grew up understanding what socialism really meant in this country, it means are roads are taken care of, schools, Medicare, Social Security, and our military are all socialist programs. Not all socialist programs are bad. We just associate the word two negative connotations.
If you honestly believed you were getting more in taxes, welcome to reality. Those that have been scammed before by Trump already know that he's in it for nothing more than himself. He's like King Midas. He's despicable, and a pathetic racist.	#TaxScam

President Trump made false claims about "late-term abortion." Here are the facts https://t.co/LlA3j9jVKU
@realDonaldTrump That means nothing. They don't have the information Mueller has and it's his report that will show if there is or is not any collusion. Which if you don't realize is another word for conspiracy. And that is definitely against the law.
At least that is my take away from our conversations together. He and I have always left the conversation on a good note. https://t.co/LsnSRuBfI8
Pete if you're talkin about the comment that one of us made. It was not my intention if that was the impression I gave you. I was agreeing with you. And after many times talking with Bruce oh, he is not trolling he really does believe what he state, but is a good guy. https://t.co/LsnSRujEQA
@Acosta If I'm not mistaken if he declares a National Emergency Congress done can say no you can't.
@Acosta Overturned. He has no legal grounds to stand on. If he tries to call a national emergency it will absolutely be turned down.
@CBSThisMorning when it comes to mold and it can actually do permanent damage. It is nothing to mess. In Arizona there are laws to protect the renter. I did this job for over 20 yrs. and managed over 100 properties. The management company has absolutely no excuse#MilitaryHousing
@Acosta Sarah, please do not think we believe you. Trump himself during one of his rallies said that he wanted to punch the shit out of someone. So don't try to tell me he's not pro violent. He's a deceitful and despicable human being.

The reason in my opinion that Democrats have been so quiet regarding the Lt. Governor, and spoke up during Kavanaugh has to do with Kavanaugh being appointed to a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court. But just like Kavanaugh he should be given the chance to an investigation.
When it comes to Virginia. You have 2 men who have said they're guilty and 1 who said he's not. When a person admits to a crime there is a punishment. When a someone says they're innocent yeah, they get a trial. I think being that I'm a Democrat these standards should be used.
