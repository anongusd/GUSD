Why aren't you upset about your tax dollars use?
@RealCandaceO But, by our own laws, what he is saying is illegal? Are we not a nation of laws and order and helping our neighbor? All of these people who are afraid of a walking band of poverty really should be ashamed of themselves.
@LukNubs @KarlaAshenhurs2 wasn't me trying to persuade you buddy-o, it was me shaming you, and I know it will have no effect, the same it has been since that orange embarrassment took the oath if office.
@LukNubs @KarlaAshenhurs2 piece of information presented to you that is anti-trump and lap up anything good from whatever source, that is, you eat propoganda up.		Trump supporters and hitler supporters are cut from the same scared, guillible, sensationalizable cloth. 		Oh, and me calling you an idiot
@LukNubs @KarlaAshenhurs2 Hiw are you any different? You are xenophobic (Central/South Americans/brown people in life of Jewish people), you support nationalist ideas, have little care for the rule of law or the way things are supposed to be done because of your daddy Trump, you refuse to believe any
@LukNubs @KarlaAshenhurs2 I'm not comparing trump toHitler, I'm comparing hitler supporters to trump supporters, i.e. comparing idiots who blindly support someone to idiot's who blindly support someone, i.e. a standard analogy
@LukNubs @KarlaAshenhurs2 @upixmusic No, trying to win people over happened for the first two years of his presidency, at this point, they are just a lost cause. Hitler still had a decent amount of support at the end of WWII, so, not everyone is worth debating with.

@POTUS could end homelessness for veterans and provide the care they need for the next ~17 years continuously.		Instead of creating more veterans, how about we take care of those that already exist.	#spaceforce #Veterans	#budget #homelessness #actuallyMakeAmericaGreatAgain
(job consulting, additions services, mental health, etc) = $12k/year	40,000x12,000= $480 million per year to house and provide for all homeless veterans	8b/480m= 16.67
The proposed budget for the creation of the "Space Force" is $8b over the next 5 years.		There are ~40,000 homeless veterans in the US.	Rent+utilities in cheap environment cost about $500/month plus throw in an additional $500/month for necessary services

And they did this season by saying the players are allowed to stay in the locker rooms as they did pre 9/11 if they don't want to stand
@twin2388 @cosmos2114 @Tara_Sandback @Jeremyricker3 @realBillBean @realDonaldTrump @thewealthystep Most of us are on the same side here, we can let a loud minority overcome progress.
@cosmos2114 @twin2388 @Tara_Sandback @Jeremyricker3 @realBillBean @realDonaldTrump @thewealthystep There's a huge difference between me disobeying an order and a private citizen expressing their constitutional right.

@kenretired2015 @USATODAY And the OFF DUTY officer moonlighting as a security guard had a chance to do that, right up to the point when he tased her in the back at a grocery store.
@USATODAY Jesus, the first comment is about race, the others are mocking a kid for getting tased. I'm sooo proud of the adults on here for knowing that stealing is wrong, but do you think the cop could have maybe caught her? She's 11, if a cop can't outrun them then they shouldn't be a cop
@starwarsmommyx3 @MattRoden13 @JACKCincyCasino @CincyProblems @WLWT @WCPO I understand compassion, but people who carelessly call people soulless dicks on the internet without any knowledge of who they are, are anything but, maybe take some time to self reflect on that today.

@ChadHutch09 @Wayne_Swiss @kort_rob @BeaverGustavo @CarlCvitanza @FoxNews Okay then, I served, so let's talk. I can only assume you're an armchair play caller, not a service member, so FYI, this is actually respectful.

@JSx1994x @Tetley55 @FoxNews And while we should 100% be concerned about the overzealous nature of police officers trigger fingers, we should also be concerned about why 12% of the population accounts for 1/4 of police killings.
@JSx1994x @Tetley55 @FoxNews We're going to visit a 4 letter word you failed in middle school, math. Specifically propprtions. The US population is ~12.1-14% AA and the % of AA killed by police by your data are ~26%, so while fewer AA were killed, they were killed at a much higher rate, per capita.
