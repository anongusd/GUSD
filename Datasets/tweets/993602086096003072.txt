Money, resources, lower incarceration rates, higher amounts of people getting treatment.		Do your research before you spread falsehoods.
@leahmcelrath @TeamTrump I am informed enough to understand the issues that the left mention they are scared for. And I choose to disagree with the majority of what they are worried about because they have been told to be scared. We absolutely live in troubling times. There is hatred and violence. Sadly
