Downside of the #Hanoi summit: No deal, photo ops have the effect of legitimizing an evil dictator. 		Upside: President Trump walked away from a bad deal, and Americans sleep a little better at night knowing we’re not on the brink of nuclear war.

SCREENSHOT. https://t.co/sroVGxnaFB
"Mentally ill individuals intent on committing violence frequently find ways to commit mass killings in countries with even the most restrictive gun control laws." (Lots of examples in paper.) So how do we address?
Despite connection btwn mental illness and mass violence, "it is a mistake to focus on the means of violence employed instead of focusing on the underlying untreated serious mental illness that led the individual to violent actions in the first place."
"By focusing on intervention and treatment for individuals exhibiting clear signs of serious mental illness that heightens their risk of danger to self or others, we can lower the risk of mass public violence w/o imposing broad restrictions on the rights of law-abiding citizens."
"Although most individuals suffering from a mental illness do not and will never pose a heightened risk of danger to the general public, there is a strong connection between mass public violence and mental illness that cannot be ignored."
So what next? "Untreated serious mental illness is associated with a higher likelihood of violent behavior."		"Many mass public killings—including mass public shootings—are committed by individuals with untreated mental illness."
"IN SUM, policies designed to reduce suicide rates by limiting firearm access for mentally ill persons may be an important step in the right direction for reducing state and national suicide rates, but they are not comprehensive solutions to a much more complex problem."
"While individuals with serious mental illness may have an increased risk for committing suicide when they have ready access to firearms, they may also be generally less likely to commit suicide with firearms." Why? Because "they often have greater barriers to firearm access."
BUT "When individuals have serious mental illness, firearm access may increase their risk of committing suicide."
"[In the U.S.] since 1999, while the number of privately owned firearms has increased by more than 100 million, the percentage of suicides committed with firearms has actually decreased." In sum, more guns ≠ more suicides.
"At the same time, a number of countries with severely restrictive gun control laws have significantly higher rates of suicide than the United States, including France, Finland, Belgium, Russia, Japan, and South Korea."
Few points: "Our national suicide rate stands roughly at the world average and is comparable to the rate experienced by many European countries—despite their significantly lower rates of private firearm ownership."

The Left's crusade against faith-based adoption agencies is heartless and cruel. The Trump administration made the right decision in granting a waiver to Miracle Hill Ministries in SC today. Anyone who puts the well-being of children over politics should agree.

I still don't understand how you're more concerned w/the harassment of journalists than the harassment of teenage boys, caused by journalists.		The teenage boys got threatening emails, Facebook messages etc., too. In fact, they couldn't even go to school. https://t.co/GEKDm3Ucvt

2/2- Even if Sandman exemplified any of these, which he does ***NOT***, it would be wrong to use him in this way. Nick Sandman is a CHILD, and the media and the Left are supposed to be the “adults.” What they are doing to him is disgusting and a complete abuse of their power.
1/2- The media and the Left (two of the same) are using Nick Sandman and #CovingtonCatholic as a PROP to peddle their most cherished ideas of racism, white privileged, toxic masculinity, and Trump supporters.

@inihelene LOL. Asking Brett Kavanaugh to resign from the Supreme Court based on uncorroborated and false allegations is definitely a "reasonable request."

And if you don't want to take it from me since I'm a conservative and conservatives couldn't possibly(!) be right, perhaps you'll take it from the founder of #MeToo, who wrote "the movement has lost its way." https://t.co/kBFxVqyzk2
@inihelene Agreed—it's an unacceptable "solution." So let's address why they're doing that. Could it be the #MeToo movement has gone too far? Could it be the movement has lost its way? https://t.co/kBFxVqyzk2
The #MeToo movement identified a problem, and radical feminists have offered their solution. To deny their solution has wound up hurting women is denying a sad reality. The pendulum has swung too far in the opposite direction and your inability to acknowledge this makes it worse. https://t.co/eKm2Oc28i4
@inihelene I'm not "blaming a movement of equality" for violence against women. If you knew anything about my work, you'd know I was a strong supporter of #MeToo. But to deny that feminists' radical solutions have ended up hurting women along the way is denying a sad reality women now face.

2/4 That same attorney later requested that Phillips create a cake celebrating Satan. I'd like to remind people that Jack is from a small town outside Denver, and never asked to be involved in ANY of this. HE was sued, not the other way around.

@ErickaAndersen @mikiebarb Agreed.
(2/2) There are plenty of well-spoken conservative women who are rightly concerned about sexual harassment/assault, sympathetic towards Ford, &amp; want to support #MeToo but think the movement’s getting out of hand. Biased &amp; unfair, IMO. The MSNBC ad at the end was perfect, though.

YES LINDSEY GRAHAM, YES. HELL YES.
If Kavanaugh is denied a seat on the Supreme Court with this little evidence, the country will have a new, dangerous precedent when it comes to sexual assault.		This is about so much more than politics. This is about ruining peoples' lives.
Kavanaugh's testimony was real, raw, and full of emotion. But he also offered facts. As many facts as he could to prove his innocence against an allegation dating back 30+ years. Says he "never sexually assaulted anyone.” “Not ever.”
I held off tweeting for most of the day because I wanted to watch Ford's testimony with an open mind. She appeared sympathetic and I believe something traumatic happened to her. But she not only didn't offer new evidence, she undermined much of the evidence she already offered.

Here is a text from one of the #SantaFe shooting survivors I interviewed. She gave me permission to share it. Whether you agree or disagree w/their opinions, these students deserve to be heard. They went through the same thing as Parkland. They just came to a different conclusion https://t.co/oAd3uh7Vnk
One of the first things I learned as a journalist is there are three sides to every story. But when it comes to student survivors of school shootings, you only hear from one.
That's right, the MSM doesn't care about reporting on all the amazing things students from #SantaFe are doing because they don't think banning guns will solve school shootings. This is worse than a double standard—it's media malpractice.

@dontmindifidrew I have been in TX interviewing Santa Fe students for the past 3 days &amp; haven’t been able to closely follow the crisis. I don’t publicly comment on things until I feel I have a full grasp of the policy &amp; proposed solutions. Sometimes I wish more people would do the same.
@dontmindifidrew I wasn’t commenting on the policy. I was commenting on the state of our political discourse,which is also, beneath America.
@dontmindifidrew It’s not an either or. If you want to solve the current crisis, the country needs to be able to have a rational conversation about it. This behavior is below that.

So what is it—do we want to be *equal* to men, or do we want to be given *extra* compared to men? Because given that women "are more likely to reduce their work hours, take time off, turn down a promotion or quit their jobs to care for family," we can't have it both ways.
Because from ages 25-35, women *choose* to work less. If our incomes were perfectly equal to men during this time, we wouldn't be paid equal—we would be paid EXTRA.
The big takeaway from this @nytimes piece is that if women want equal pay for equal work, then we've achieved that. 		https://t.co/8DfeixHpia

@lyndseyfifield It’s an idea he publicly voiced support for so I think it’s fair to point out he didn’t address it in front of a gun-friendly audience @ CPAC. As for the terminology, sorry I didn’t get it exact on twitter but you know what I meant.
@lyndseyfifield https://t.co/RGpcHMLT6d
Notably, however, he didn’t mention his idea to raise age limit for assault rifles to 21. Would that have gotten him booed?
It required a lot of bravery for Trump to call for increased background checks &amp; stricter policies for mental illness in front of #CPAC2018 audience, very pro #2A. His remarks were met with applause.

UPDATE: Women can NOT unite around the United leggings scandal! We're doomed.
@crousselle @united what other company regulates what children wear?
@crousselle @united you really think United should be in the business of regulating what 10 and 11 year olds wear?
@crousselle I just don't think @united should be in the business of regulating what children wear, leggings or no leggings.
@JoeC1776 Yes, and I'm saying @united should consider changing what's on the books bc they shouldn't be regulating what teenage girls wear.
@DLoesch @united yes, they have a right to make this policy but that doesn't mean I can't (or won't) criticize it💁
@JoeC1776 what's silly to me is the fact that teens were banned from flying bc they wore leggings, no matter who their parents are.
@JoeC1776 yes &amp; I think after banning teens wearing leggings from flying would be a good time to reevaluate (If that's really what happened)
@JoeC1776 what's the issue then?
@crousselle teens are supposed to dress business casual and leggings don't count? What counts for men (or boys)? I'd be curious.
@JoeC1776 Companies can have their own rules but that doesn't mean those rules aren't stupid (or sexist).
@kelseyjharkness @mkhammer good thing you don't work for United. You and your girls would be in trouble. 😂
@DLoesch asking @United. I think in the world of "athleisure," women (and girls) can look very put together in leggings.
@DLoesch Also, what's so inappropriate about leggings?
@DLoesch But was the employee on duty or in uniform? If not why does their (and more importantly, their child's) attire matter?
@kelseyjharkness Or, alternatively, #UnitedforLeggings. So many options! #United
