It’s becoming increasingly clear Trump faces a three-pronged legal threat: Mueller’s collusion/obstruction cases, SDNY’s financial investigations big and small, and the House’s continued effort to understand potential crimes he committed as president. Pls join us @OutFrontCNN
Regardless of what Mueller finds, Cohen made it clear that there are plenty of issues with Trump’s finances and his organization’s finances that SDNY and Congress will likely investigate. Trump must now realize that Mueller is not the end to his legal problems. Pls join @AC360

Alex Cora is not just the first Puerto Rican baseball manager to reach a World Series &amp; 1st rookie manager to win it all.  He is also a class act: in negotiating his contract, he insisted Red Sox provide a plane full of supplies to his home town after devastating hurricanes.

As I said last night on @AC360, Trump has unleashed dogs of hatred - and subsequent snarling and barking - in such a way that threats of violence were inevitable. The president may not be directly responsible for yesterday, but he creates the climate of hatred that led us here.
Since the beginning of his campaign, Donald Trump has unloosed the dogs of hatred in our country. Days like today are reminders of how dangerous that can be. Jeff Zucker was right: the White House needs to take at least some responsibility for what has happened.
.@JeffFlake was right today - we have too many enemies to try to terrorize one another. We need all of our officials to condemn today’s attempted attacks explicitly and unconditionally. Pls join us from outside the @CNN studio to discuss what has been an eye-opening day @AC360.
Trump may have meant something more benign last night in Texas. But it felt as though he was intending to imply the word “white” before nationalist.
When one thinks about the leaders who have celebrated nationalism throughout history, it’s saddening to hear the President of the United States describe himself as a nationalist proudly. Pls join as we discuss Trump’s alarming rhetoric next @OutFrontCNN @jaketapper

The awful killing of Jamaal Khashoggi and its aftermath are growing into Trump’s first international crisis. The investigation is being slow walked—and Trump appears willing to defer to a monarch. It’s time for Trump and the Saudis to show their cards and tell us what they know.
The details coming from the @nytimes and @washingtonpost about how Jamaal Khashoggi was killed and who killed him are deeply disturbing. We need our leaders to seek the truth about what happened—for journalists and democracy around the world. Pls join us @BrookeBCNN @CNNnewsroom
Has Trump met a strongman he doesn’t like?  He’s favoring one again in the Khashoggi case—and again at the expense of democratic values. The Saudis have been an American ally but an honest accounting of Jamaal's death is needed to preserve the relationship. Pls join @CNNnewsroom
Especially looking forward to being in conversation with @KirstenPowers on this topic. It’s always a pleasure to be on with her.

To give the full numbers from just now: National @CNN poll on Kavanaugh shows 49% of Independents disapprove of his confirmation versus only 37% approving. Among very enthusaistic voters, 58% disapprove and only 40% approve. https://t.co/0wikq4Eass
While the GOP may get a Kav. bump in some red states, @CNN poll shows that his approval is the lowest for a nominee since Bork. With Trump’s words today as fuel, it seems that this confirmation will more likely drive Democrats (especially women) to the polls. Pls join next @AC360

The past week was a tragic one—for the Senate, the Supreme Court, and our body politic (especially women). Pls join us at 7pm as we discuss what happened and what is to come. @lynnsweet @CNNnewsroom
With Kavanaugh confirmed, all three branches of our federal gov’t - Congress, White House and Supreme Court - are now defined by partisan politics. Our long, often inspiring tradition of bipartisanship is all but dead. Full thoughts here. @CNNOpinion https://t.co/ekbL3Knjzc
Kavanaugh’s victory will leave millions of women angry and disgusted; political parties more bitterly divided than in decades; and the Court safely in the hands of conservatives for a generation or more. A key - and sad - moment in our history. Pls join as we discuss @OutFrontCNN
Will 3pm bring Susan Collins’ Profile in Courage moment? She may still embody her hero Margaret Chase Smith and stand up to her party. If she doesn’t, one wonders about how many millions of women will think about the legitimacy of the court.
As uncertainty grows over the Kavanaugh vote, there’s even less clarity regarding the controversy’s impact on midterms. Probably the case that the losing side on Kavanaugh will be highly energized in November. Pls join as we discuss this process and its consequences next @AC360

Jamie Roche’s interview with @AC360 suggests that the FBI should look at Kavanaugh’s drinking - not because it was wrong, but because he may have lied about it and it likely had a role in the events Dr. Ford and Deborah Ramirez describe. Will join @donlemon at 11pm to discuss.
Jamie Roche, Kavanaugh’s freshman roommate, just said Judge Kavanaugh drank much more than Kavanaugh said he did to the committee. His interview raises questions about Kavanaugh’s honesty - and whether the FBI performed a thorough search for truth. Pls join as we discuss @AC360

Admirable leadership today by Jeff Flake and Chris Coons to bring the Senate back from the brink of one of the most divisive votes in modern Congressional history. Pls join as we discuss what happened today and what’s ahead @AC360 @JeffreyToobin @DanaBashCNN
The Senate and President would be wise to embrace a one week delay (and questioning of Mark Judge).  It’s the right thing to do judicially, and it would show a measure of respect to millions of women assaulted in the past.
A pivotal day for the country is ahead. Will Jeff Flake - or two other Republicans - listen to the guidance of the American Bar Association? Americans need more time and information. It’s the Senate’s duty to provide both. Pls join as we discuss the Committee vote @CNNnewsroom
Republicans will rush this process - and that is a mistake. Waiting, gathering more information, and listening to the voices of women across the country would be wise and, more importantly, the right thing to do. Pls join us @CNNTonight
Ford and Kavanaugh are both saying that 100%, they are telling the truth. An FBI investigation — and a conversation with Mark Judge — are the key to finding truth and rebuilding trust. Pls join as we discuss now @OutFrontCNN @KateBolduan

After Dr. Ford rallied many to her side, Brett Kavanaugh is now inspiring conservatives — tough, defiant, emotionally moving.  Question: Will his virulent attacks against Dems create fear that if confirmed, he will seek revenge against the left?
Two big surprises so far in hearing:  Dr. Ford is stunningly effective — smart, vulnerable, human, someone you would like to have as a friend or neighbor.  At same time, GOP questioner is stunningly ineffective.  In fairness, we still need to hear from Judge Kavanaugh.
Too early to make final judgments about hearing but one thing is clear: Dr Ford in her opening gave the country a powerful, compelling understanding of the horrors for a woman to be sexually abused.  Haunting.  @CNN
For those convinced Dr. Blasey Ford’s allegations are a con job, it’s essential to remember Neil Gorsuch went to the same school and was also a staunch conservative, and no one questioned his character or actions — and 3 D’s voted for him. Today is about more than politics.
At this pivotal moment for our nation, I wonder how Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins want to be remembered. Do they want to be seen as the champions of women they’ve long been, or as senators who stood with Trump to confirm his justice accused of assault? Pls join at 8pm @AC360
Warmest congratulations to @SashaChanoff and @AmyGSlaughter on winning the #SEOY2018 award from @schwabfound. We need more young innovators and leaders like them. https://t.co/eCa96iem77
Since this second story of alleged conduct by Brett Kavanaugh is so serious, we must proceed with caution and care. The country - and the Senate - desperately need as many facts as possible and, therefore, there must be at least one independent investigation into his conduct.
Misspoke on air tonight: @NBCNews /@WSJ poll shows women favor Dems for Congress 58/33. I had said that was Kavanaugh’s approval. Instead, 31% of people support his confirmation, the lowest since Bork.
Republican Senators must be thoughtful this week. Kavanaugh is already the least popular Supreme Court nominee since Bork - and @NBCNews/@WSJ have Democrats up 25 with women. But the question is, will they be? Pls join as we discuss @CNNnewsroom @AnaCabrera
Trump’s attack on the judicial system should worry us all - and now, he could have an excuse to finally get rid of Rosenstein. Pls join as we discuss what today’s @nytimes story could mean for the Mueller probe.
If Dr. Blasey Ford speaks, it’s essential to be mindful of and sensitive to the power imbalance between her and Justice Kavanaugh. He is a Supreme Court nominee with the president and Senate majority fully in his corner. She’s a private citizen, with the support of Dem minority.
Our country undoubtedly needs leaders who put country over party, and the veterans @WithHonorFund and others support can and will do just that. They deserve our support come November 6th. https://t.co/XaVUKinAUy

Is it somehow possible that Anita Hill, whose hearing was horribly disrespectful toward her, received more due process than Dr. Ford is? When Anita Hill came forward, George H.W. Bush called for an FBI investigation. Will President Trump at least do that for Dr. Ford? https://t.co/rQQlgoCXn7

Much internet praise for #CarlyFiorina. She not only won on GOP stage but now in social media.
Did anyone "win" GOP 2nd string debate?  For my money, Carly Fiorina -- substantive, wide bandwidth, passion.  Hope she gets into top 10
GOP debate bringing out black and white arguments... nuance, complexity disappear again and again
4th Qtr debate:  While I disagree on substance, Carly Fiorina on foreign policy made most sophisticated arguments of night.
3rd Qtr debate 2nd string: econ arguments strong but rooted in past.... where is understanding of power of innovation,  technology??
2nd Qtr GOP debate for 2nd string: Santorum connective, Perry strong on borders... but where is their respect &amp; compassion for Hispanics?
Snarky point:  who advised Carly Fiorina -- a person of substance -- to wear orange/red against orange/red background?
After 1st Qtr of GOP debate w/ 2nd stringers, looks like long nite.  They are tight and too scripted.  Need to get deeper, tangier

How much longer will the world permit the brutality of ISIS?  Why can't we go after them harder?

Correction: Chirac was President, not PM, when he was first international leader to come to WH in support of US after 9/11.  @CNN
Finally: US often asks French, others to stand with us when we are struck by terrorist forces; now we need to stand with them. @CNN
Remember: after 9/11, French rallied behind US and French PM Chirac first foreign leader to come to WH after -- a week later  @CNN
Still, am mystified why WH didn't ask Vice President Biden to join the march.  He would have been perfect.  @CNN
I am sympathetic to Obama in not joining March -- wd have added big security concerns for French govt.
Jane Hartley, excellent US ambassador to France, represented US in Paris march.  But many ask whether US shd have had stronger rep. @CNN
40 world leaders marched in solidarity with French, showing they stand in unity, too.  Also powerful message.
The big, welcome news fm France today is that 3.7 million marched in unity, sending powerful message of unity ag terrorists.  @CNN

May the spirit of Christmas be with you and your loved ones tonight!
Mark me down as naive but on Christmas Eve 100 years later, I would like to think miracles are still possible.
Is it possible for us to crawl out of our trenches and seek our own truce?
Isn't there a message here for us in America and in so many other countries where internal battles rage?
Cynics today like to minimize what happened but for years after, the troops who were there called it a miracle.
That day, they played football together and exchanged cigarettes, chocolates while showing pictures of girlfriends back home.
The next morning, the troops gingerly raised their heads above the trench lines and crawled out to meet each other.
It was Christmas Eve &amp; they began singing carols to each other.  Silent Night echoed across No Man's land in German and English.
On this night exactly 100 years ago, a small miracle in WW I: British &amp; German troops living in trenches, killing each other, remembered.

After Cantor, Hillary can now assert w/ greater credibility that she--not the GOP--represents sensibility &amp;moderation http://t.co/xRtlp2A9Xh
Is Cantor's loss prompting 2nd thoughts by Jeb Bush &amp; his admirers re: whether '16 is the right year for him to run? http://t.co/wZtYBCieVQ
Fewer than 8,000 voters in a suburb of Richmond, VA substantially altered the national narrative. My take: http://t.co/dD1wUU3IRW #Cantor
Rarely has a GOP congressional primary had such wide repercussions. For Hillary, they almost all run in her favor: http://t.co/dD1wUU3IRW

The VA desperately needs a leader who can overhaul an agency notoriously resistant to change. My recommendations: http://t.co/zYRqq3sNdv
1st fix at the VA? Appoint world-class leader to run the place &amp; a squad of talented vets as a personal support team http://t.co/zYRqq3sNdv
Iraq &amp; Afgh veterans have had too little voice in the VA. It's time to call on the best to serve their country again. http://t.co/B9x3oApzqs
Unfortunately, the best person in the country to run the VA is the least available: Robert Gates. My take: http://t.co/B9x3oApzqs
To fix VA, call on the best: talented Iraq-Afgh vets. Have taught stars like @maurasullivan who can make VA hum again http://t.co/B9x3oApzqs
How to fix VA fast: call to the rescue @EricGreitens of @missioncontinue &amp; other talented Iraq-Afghan vets. My take: http://t.co/i9SgoLMmmp

Details of new GOP House plan are coming out now. Join us now on @CNNnewsroom as we parse through the dealmaking. Are we close to a deal?
My hunch: Boehner falls on his sword for the sake of the country. After fiascos of past w/ GOP extremists, honorable way out. @AC360
DC key may be Boehner: will he go along w hardliners &amp; default OR defy them, prevent default and endanger his job? Your view? @AC360
Awful process but think chances of avoiding default remain above 50%. May be a cliffhanger.  @AC360 CNN
Here comes Red Sox Nation!  Boston strong again!
Scary thought fm Dem leader: only way to break DC impasse may be Asian mkt crash Monday, US market crash. Knock sense. @CNN @AC360

If you listened closely today, you heard Obama offering the GOP a wise way out.  Why aren't they taking it?  Why, why, why?  @AC360
Janet Yellen the right choice now for Fed, but my thoughts tonight w/ @LarrySummers -- he was treated very wrongly.  @AC360 @CNN

To me, GOP extremists deserve most blame for shutdown but Dem ldrs not blameless. Both must work to re-open, avoid default  @AC360
Freezing Congressional salaries -- while 800,000 furloughed -- sounds good way to keep pressure on. And fair!  @AC360 CNN @CNN

A salute to Prez Obama for calling in Congr leaders.  If he brings constructive ideas, perhaps he can get us out of ditch. @AC360 CNN
In congressional leadership meeting today, Obama should, in LBJ fashion, keep 'em talking till they get a big deal http://t.co/GU8ocDeARr
Biggest reason Dem leaders taking hard line becuz fed up with GOP.  But clearly they also see chance to re-capture the House.  @AC360
Join us now @AC360 CNN. Does Obama have his eye on 2014 elections?  Could Dems take back the House?
Seasoned GOP leaders know that if the shutdown does serious damage, they risk losing big in 2014 and 2016. http://t.co/3WF4vGDsyr
Obama needs to seize the mantle of leadership &amp; get us out of this mess.Call in leaders of both parties &amp; strike deal http://t.co/3WF4vGDsyr
Prez takes tough stance on shutdown. In effect demands GOP surrender.  Will it work?  Probably ...over time. Your view? @AC360
If enough Americans rise up &amp; pressure D.C. to call off this circus, we could end this foolishness AND avoid default http://t.co/3WF4vGDsyr
Obama should call in the leaders of both parties and in Lyndon Johnson fashion, keep 'em talking till they get a deal http://t.co/3WF4vGDsyr

Last round up for the nite. Pls join us now at @piersmorgan @CNN. Strong paneling Washington circus.
The government is now shut down. But could this have a silver lining? Could the backlash help to prevent default? http://t.co/3WF4vGDsyr
The shutdown pales in comparison with the danger posed by a second, lurking threat: a default on our public finances. http://t.co/3WF4vGDsyr
Big question tonite is whether doing something stupid (shutdown) will help us avoid truly dangerous (default in mid October). @AC360
Where do we go from here on shutdown, now inevitable?  Pls join us momentarily on @AC360 @CNN
Once the shutdown occurs, Obama has fresh responsibility to seize the mantle of leadership &amp; get us out of this mess http://t.co/aKyPkchcAU
Faction of only 10% of House --hard line conservatives-- driving us toward shutdown. Does that make sense?  Seems crazy.  @AC360
Can GOP moderates eventually round up enuf votes to get a clean bill in House tonight &amp; end this madness? Key question now. @AC360
@amyjccuddy wowed students at Kennedy School today -- no wonder her TED talk on persuasion &amp; influence has had 20 million viewers.
Glad to see so many of you angry w/ shutdown. The more you make 'em feel the heat, the faster circus will end. @AC360 tonite @CNN
GOP rightly hit for shutdown but Dems shd not be cocky. @CNN poll: 69% say GOP like spoiled kids. 58% say same of Dems  @AC360
With shutdown imminent, Prez talking w Congress ldrs tonite. Could be a hopeful sign.  Pls join us 8 pm @AC360 @CNN.
(2/2) Yes, GOP hard-liners have chosen the wrong place to fight. But Dems can ill afford to continue rejecting talks http://t.co/aKyPkchcAU
The harsh rhetoric from Obama to GOP suggests he's less interested in settlement than unconditional surrender. http://t.co/aKyPkchcAU
Seasoned GOP leaders know that a shutdown could evaportate Republican chances at retaking the Senate &amp; White House http://t.co/aKyPkchcAU
The #governmentshutdown could have a silver lining: an electric shock to the political system. My thoughts: http://t.co/aKyPkchcAU @CNN
So far, your reactions tonite to strong likelihood of govt shutdown are running roughly 8-2 against GOP.
On govt shutdown: Do u think GOP arguments persuading more of public?  Or is this as self destructive as it has seemed?
Govt shutdown 90% likely aft House vote.  Could shock DC out of craziness, into agreement before default. But terrible way to govern.
@DanielJHatfield @AC360 let's be clear here too: as I said last night at Purdue, GOP will bear most blame for a shutdown. @AC360
Let's be clear: Have said &amp; still say Obama handling Iran pretty darn well.  Sanctions brought Iran to table. @AC360
Govt shutdown could be good shock therapy -- awaken US to how dangerous this game is -- force DC to avoid horrendous default. @AC360

Not all is lost for Obama on Tuesday night. Big speeches can reframe issues. But the public terrain is rough. http://t.co/3PaDKg2Ie1 #Syria
Perhaps he will persuade a skeptical public, but it is surely the toughest speaking assignment of Obama's presidency: http://t.co/3PaDKg2Ie1
A dramatic media blitz for Obama. But if he has new arrows in his quiver, he likely would have shot them by now: http://t.co/3PaDKg2Ie1 #CNN
If Obama fails this week, he will have turned a problem in #Syria into a crisis in his presidency: http://t.co/3PaDKg2Ie1 @DanJKatz

Thanks for watching @OurNixon @CNN tonite. Saw bright side of RN -- and the dark side that brought him down. Stuff of Shakespeare.
Why do I say RN a good strategist, many ask @OurNixon @CNN.  Start with trip to China-- brilliant, successful splitting China-Soviet axis.
RN-Haldeman convo fascinating @OurNixon @CNN.  Bob and Dwight continued to believe in the best of Nixon. Ehrlichman felt betrayed
We will never know if RN ordered Watergate @OurNixon @CNN. But I bet  plumbers thought he would be pleased if they broke in.
Some saying tonite @OurNixon @CNN RN was liberal. He WAS domestically. Friend Mark Shields calls him our last liberal Prez. Insightful.
How one wishes Nixon might have exorcised his demons, to put down that shadow side so that his bright side could emerge triumphant #ournixon
Nixon was convinced that only by being tough and often mean could he survive. It amounted to a political suicide. #OurNixon
In truth, Nixon was the best strategist I have seen in the presidency -- someone able to look 30 years into the future #ournixon
Nixon thought of himself as a better person than he was commonly understood, which added to his frustration #ounixon
Nixon thought he had to control events, not be controlled by them. So he started bugging phones of reporters &amp; his own appointees #ournixon
Nixon came to power not only w/ insecurities but w/ a bitterly divisive war on his hands that threatened to tear the country apart #ournixon
Worth remembering @OurNixon CNN how big RN was in our politics in 20th century: he made cover of Time 56 times!
Big question @OurNixon @CNN right now: why do smart leaders like Nixon do really dumb things?  Question arises again and again.
Glad you are seeing Dwight Chapin @OurNixon @CNN. He was young, talented ... And went to jail because he carried out orders. Huge tragedy
Only a select few knew of the taping system; learning of it was a shock to all the rest of us on staff. #ournixon @cnn
Emotionally, I was drawn more to Chapin: he was young and relatively innocent #OurNixon @CNN
Fascinating footage being shown on @CNN's #OurNixon right now. Chapin was one of the most creative advisers I have seen in the White House.

Tonight at 9pET on @CNN: @OurNixon. Nixon was the best strategist I have seen in the presidency. But he lost it all: http://t.co/HYIiFgpirn
Tonight at 9pET on @CNN: @OurNixon. This film offers a first-hand look at parts of the man rarely seen. My thoughts: http://t.co/HYIiFgpirn
I'll always believe Nixon had elements of greatness in him, but he was ultimately the architect of his own downfall: http://t.co/HYIiFgpirn
Nixon came to believe that politics is a jungle. To survive, one must observe the law: Either eat or be eaten. http://t.co/HYIiFgpirn #CNN
Nixon thought he had to control events, not be controlled by them. So, he started bugging the phones. http://t.co/HYIiFgpirn @OurNixon #CNN
Nixon almost had it all -- and then he lost it. Why? Why do colossally powerful men make a colossal hash of things? http://t.co/XWNITIPVPt
It's hard for younger generations to grasp just how dominant a figure Nixon was for over 4 decades in American life: http://t.co/XWNITIPVPt

Looking frwrd to discussing IRS mess on @AC360 tonite @ 8ET. Scandals may cost Obama precious asset of his presidency: the moral high ground
Is Obamacare heading for possible train wreck (Baucus) or bumps in road (White House)?  I find hospitals across US worry wreck ahead.
If health care costs go up, not only will premiums spar but new chunks will come out of hospitals -- and many already hard pressed.
In fascinating talks, hospital leaders of Southern CA say they still like Obamacare but worry costs will be far higher than forecast.

Those who ask how sequester hurting poor as well as travelers are right to ask.  We need to cut spending but do it smartly.
With snafu's in the sky, ppl flocking to Amtrak. Train fm NY to Boston packed this am.
3 days of flying, 3 days of nasty delays.	Recalls how British army saw word "snafu" as acronym for .....
Another flight delay yesterday fm Atlanta.  Friends report same elsewhere. Ridiculous way to carry out modest budget cuts.

Relieved in Boston by lifting lockdown.  Ppl were already on streets but this lowers anxiety, ends cabin fever. Pls here impressed by cops
Even though we are locked down in Cambridge, a feeling of calm -- police are excellent, brave and everywhere.
Sirens blazing away as police cars everywhere near MIT and beyond. Sounds are scary but reassuring so many cops on the case.
Almost incomprehensible here in Boston --the shooting at MIT just after bombings.  But spirits of the people will not be broken.

Is that the legacy that Obama really wants to leave? Lincoln, King, FDR -- all rolled into one? My take here: http://t.co/7EVRF6vi #CNN
Scholar @ianbremmer captured Republicans' view of Obama's message to the GOP: "Together, we shall pursue my objectives"	http://t.co/7EVRF6vi
Gone were the third way of Clinton &amp; the centrism of Carter. Pres. Obama emerged as an unapologetic, unabashed liberal http://t.co/KRh4cuDk
The president looked west toward the monuments of Lincoln and King and his address artfully tied him to their legacy. http://t.co/KRh4cuDk

Incredulous that fiscal cliff talks so unproductive. When will games stop and serious negotiations begin?  Both sides owe it to country
Susan Rice made smart, generous move. Next NSC adviser? Donilon To WH Chief of Staff?  Big announcements coming soon.
Coming to DC, stunned to find how many talking as if it might be okay to go over fiscal cliff.
WSJ, pg 1: Sr admin official says White House will make no new offer on fiscal cliff until GOP caves on tax rates.  Strap on a parachute
Let's agree: affluent should pay more in taxes. But will Dems push too far, trying to humiliate GOP and killing a deal? http://t.co/QhyAeRSn
Earlier we could blame GOP for stalemate in DC. Are Obama &amp; Dems now overplaying their hands on the fiscal cliff? http://t.co/QhyAeRSn #CNN
Why has a grand bargain on the Fiscal Cliff become so much harder than it should be? My take on the negotiations: http://t.co/xU8buJge #CNN
Forgive me, but haven't we seen this movie before in the aftermath of national elections? Usually, it doesn't end well. http://t.co/xU8buJge
Yes, legitimate concern for Dems if Kerry is SecState, Scott Brown strong to win his MA seat. But Dem Sen way ahead &amp; State Dept key
Ash Carter for DOD -- he has been excellent deputy sec, knows policy and budget cutting. Former colleague Kennedy School.  Fine choice.
Credit Joe Klein w/ 3 good recommendations for Obama cabinet: Kerry, State; Susan Rice, Homeland; Ash Carter, Defense.
We especially need more political leaders with the guts to work across the aisles, build bridges
Both parties need more people with diverse views, willing to break with ideological conformity, courage to be different.
Folks: my point is that yes, Lieberman rankles many but one day, w/ so many pols marching in lockstep, we will value independent voices

Deeply saddened by news of Gen Petraeus &amp; Paula Broadwell. Both have given long service to us &amp; they &amp; their families deserve our prayers
Whatever may be said about his behavior, I believe Gen Petraeus responded admirably and with courage -- the hallmark of a true leader.
Deeply distressed by news of Gen Petraeus.  We don't know details --happy if we never do -- but he deserves our respect and gratitude.

Good point. Thanks! “@bryanmathew2189: @David_Gergen Re Obama has smaller win, remember he is only 3rd Dem to win +50% of nat'l vote 2X.”

To be clear: I think O gets more votes than R nationally. Late exits say O wins 51-47. But key remains we are very divided.#CNNElections
Great pageant of democracy today.  Let us all wish President Obama a successful second term!  #CNNElections
Women are 54% of voters nationally, go O by 55-43 per exits.  They bring Obama back to White House. #CNNElections

@SarahKSilverman.  Turtle?
CNN projects GOP keeping House.  Senate will be Dem  Can u believe $6 billion spent and we may have nothing change! #CNNElections
O win in Mich reinforces sense that his firewall holding in Midwest. R has to take states here. #CNNElections
Agree outrageous voters have to stand in line for 4-5 hrs to vote. Thought we solved this after Bush-Gore. #CNNElections
With NC and Va trending toward R, Fla becomes all important. O up slightly w/ 60% in but waiting for Panhandle. #CNNElections
2nd round exits show Fla move fm R up 1 to O plus 1.  PA has O moving up fm plus 3 to plus 5. More welcome news for Prez #CNNElections
So far, exit poll results closely mirroring public polls heading into today -- that is good omen for the President. #CNNElections
With NC andVa both tied in early exits, Obama getting leg up in electorally --even as overall vote very divided.  #CNNElections
Early exits have Obama up 3 in Ohio. Key.  Keep your eye here. #CNNElections
Remember early exits often wrong but so far, news from Va not encouraging for Mitt. He needs Va big time -- exit says tied. #CNNElections
Big question for whoever wins tonite “@DavidSay2: @David_Gergen How does a President govern in such a climate?”
CNN reports on early exits show deeply divided nation -- some good signs for O, a few for R.  NB: early exits often wrong. #CNNElections
10 states show mixed results over past 5 elections -- they are the basic swing states.  Why O favored: he is ahead in most of 10. #ac360
By comparison, GOP prez candidates have won 22 states in past 5 elections -- but worth only 180 electoral votes. #ac360
Why the Dems have structural advantage: 19 states have voted D in 5 straight elections -- worth 243 electoral votes. #ac360

Obama coming off good week politically: public giving high marks on Sandy, wet kisses from Christie &amp; Bloomberg, decent job #s. Could lift
On trip to Ohio this wk, I sensed Obama ahead. Still, as John King reports, GOP much more confident than 4 years ago. #CNNElections
If new polls right, Obama slightly ahead in 9 of 12 battleground states.  So he remains fav.  But can GOP enthusiasm reverse? #CNNElections
Have to admire the gutsiness of New Yorkers.  Showing it again tonite.  So far, we here in Boston seem mostly spared.
Sandy impact elections, Ppl ask.  A wash so far. Dems GOTV disrupted, but O has stage &amp; R momentum story fades. http://t.co/LchFlPCP
To ponder as Sandy hits: prez debates this year apparently 1st in 28 yrs when climate change not discussed.

Possible explanation: leak to NYT came before US told Israel, allies of Iran talks &amp; admin had to publicly deny to protect relations#CNN
Let's be clear: if Iran is coming to table because of sanctions, Obama &amp; Co deserve credit, a breakthru.  Important to get full story #CNN
GOP will be highly cynical of Iran stories -- will think both were planned to bolster Prez in last debate, distract fm Benghazi. #CNN
But denial by NSC on Iran story makes things murky. We need now for NYT to double back, find out what is really going on. #CNN
On its face, NYT story looks like intentional leak -- an October surprise to help Prez in debate Monday night #CNN
Direct US-Iranian talks wd be big, big deal.  Success wd head off conflict, failure wd hasten it.  Obama team has long wanted talks. #CNN

As many kindly point out, Nate 538 -- highly regarded -- is cautioning not to read too much into Gallup O vs R.  Polls of next few days key
Obama team has been smart on women's issues. Gallup in swing states finds women listing abortion, gender equity as very important. #CNN
Surprised not to see uptick yet for President in tracking polls since 2nd debate. Gallup 7 day tracking up again for Romney. Next days key
Given composition of poll, fair to say Obama had solid win overall but Romney won on economy  &amp; race likely to go down to wire #cnndebate
To those who ? CNN poll: CNN has repeatedly pointed out sample has 8% more GOP voices than in polls of likely voters. Honest. #cnndebate

Watch for Janine Turner in future. Young, black, Mormon mayor in Utah -- candidate for Congress -- brought fire to GOP convention. #CNN
Flap over Ron Paul at convention seems ridiculous.  Why didn't the two sides work this out amicably?  Esp with extra day to plan. #CNN
A great symbol of Americana, the convention roll call, now underway in Tampa. No suspense but lots of fun.  Join us #CNN?

With Isaac barreling toward NewOrleans, what should GOP do?  Go ahead Tues nite?  With changed tone?  Or cancel a 2nd nite out of respect?
Gloria Borger's documentary on Romney won raves.  If you missed, join us tonite #CNNElections 7, doc re-run 8 ...plus full Isaac story
If political conventions can be compressed from 4 nites to 3, why not explore more radical reform? My modest proposal: http://t.co/ixMQkczo
Good point. “@90bristolcourt: @David_Gergen @CNN  David: no one "heals" from MS by riding a horse. It's a chronic condition that's managed.”

Looking forward.  Thanks!“@sandrafairbank: @David_Gergen @mlzuckerman 	At Spectacle island with AG.	Will send pix.”

Sad end to Lance Armstrong saga.  Too many heroes falling -- Bonds, Tiger, Paterno, Armstrong, etc.  Wonder why.
Re Todd Aiken on rape -- perfect illustration why women who are raped should be the ones to decide whether to have the child.
Re Tommy Thompson: I am mostly rooting for a young, new generation to take power.  But Thompson one of those exceptions we shd welcome
Tommy Thompson one of nation's best reform governors on education &amp; welfare to work. Gratified to see him win Wisc Senate primary.
One opening for Obama with Ryan:  can focus debate more on budget issues, not solely on jobs. #CNN
My sense is that Ryan will wear well personally -- likable,serious, listens.  Big question is how well his ideas will wear.  Join us #CNN
What did u think of Ryan speech?  Thought his beginning ok but end was very strong -- at young 42, he seemed like adult. Join us #CNN
Will be interesting to see, starting today, if Ryan can sell his plan to America as well as he did to GOP.  #CNN
What to watch after Ryan:  how do voters 50 and older respond?  Romney needs those voters -- will they embrace GOP Medicare reform?  #CNN
Join us on #CNN to watch and analyze most important decision Romney has ever made.  In next few minutes
Romney will fire up his conservative base with Ryan.  But will it play well over time?  Will be fascinating to watch.
Mean campaigns get meaner.  Ads by Romney &amp; Obama teams each get 4 Pinocchios fm Wash Post.  Where is their leadership? @AC360

As we decry religious intolerance after Sikh shooting, hope we don't forget other question: why do so many madmen have so many guns?
To know military and leadership writing at its best, read The Face of Battle by John Keegan, British historian who has just died.
Sad to to lose military historian John Keegan. How he loved US.  And how he helped Bill Clinton celebrate 50th anniversary of Normandy.
Anderson asks right Q tonite: where is evidence for Harry Reid's charge that Romney paid no taxes for 10 yrs?  #ac360
Karl Rove writes that Team O ad blitz hasn't moved his #s. But polls all over place: Pew has O up 10, Rasrpts down by 2. Go figure.
On surface, Boehner-Reid deal to extend fed spending commitments 6 months into 2013 seems smart. Helps in avoiding fiscal cliff.
Gore Vidal had a lacerating voice that always challenged conventional wisdom. We will miss him.
Yes, have argued before: he should release more “@mms5048: RT @jeremyjewitt: So u're gonna call for Romney to release tax returns, right?
Romney's biggest mistake overseas was to stiff traveling US reporters.  The modern presidency depends on openness.

Hey folks, Obama jobs "plan" plays on edges &amp; Romney "plan" is a grab bag. Neither is serious, bold path back to growth, less debt.
When will Obama &amp; Romney offer serious, bold plans to create jobs, get us out of economic doldrums?  Need less talk, more action!

Dick Lugar was punished by Indiana voters not only for age but for willingness to reach across aisle. Extremely disappointing.  #CNN
Saddened as well to see voters in my home state of NC insert ban on gay marriage in constitution.  One day we will reverse.  #CNN
Sad day: Dick Lugar's defeat means Senate loses one of its classiest members, partisanship likely to get even worse.  #CNNElections
