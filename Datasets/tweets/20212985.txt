Really disappointed to see @cge_psu did not win its fight to unionize grad students @penn_state. Hopeful the tide will change. #UnionPower https://t.co/ID9c5zQqRy
And of course there are definitely amazing examples of comms of faith already doing this, and of housing justice folk tapping comms of faith to do so! Curious about the broader questions and how they might look in our different contexts. #OnRace
5. Basically: How can comms of faith tap their naturally created community networks/neighborhood links to show up their neighbors around evictions/housing harassment/etc? #OnRace
4. Our "moral" imperactive for housing justice: How might the secular activist rhetoric of "loving your neighbor" + taking care of one another as the base from which this work must be done be aided by connex to faith comms? From a place of religious pluralism #OnRace
3. Can comms of faith go further with notions of #sanctuary? What would it mean for every house of worship to commit to being physical sanctuary for its neighbors? #OnRace
2. Houses or worship own lots of land and built structures -- some of which are growing vacant or falling into disrepair. How can comms of faith be the solution in leveraging this for their neighbors? Their neighbors who ARE their congregations/shuls/places of worship. #OnRace
#OnRace workshop this morning on housing justice got me wondering what the role of communities of faith are in these conversations. 1. Lots of talk of trauma-informed activism, premature death and self care. How does/can spiritual practice, shared healing impact/elevate this?
