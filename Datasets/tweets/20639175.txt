@PatrickHilsman @MazMHussain I can't go to bat on that op-ed but I can on your other allegations about standards of the Middle East coverage. We're going round in circles. I look forward to you publishing the guidelines and showing how balanced we tried to be on a daily basis.
@PatrickHilsman @MazMHussain The guidelines were for reporters, not op-ed editors. Hate on the piece, not our ME coverage as a whole.
@PatrickHilsman @MazMHussain Well, check my pinned tweet. All the best to you for whatever you do next. But if you publish them let me know so I can challenge you on this again.
@PatrickHilsman @MazMHussain Good luck referring to the region as Palestine wherever you go next. You'll probably be gone on day one too.
@PatrickHilsman @MazMHussain Look, you can change the subject. You're wrong about the guidelines. Publish them &amp; see if people agree with you. I think you'll be surprised. It's called trying to be accurate &amp; precise in reporting, &amp; treating a delicate subject carefully.
@PatrickHilsman @MazMHussain How many times do I have to explain it? It says call it a wall where it is a wall, call it a fence where it is a fence, collectively, a barrier. Have you ever been to the region and seen it? It's not all a wall. Jesus.
@PatrickHilsman @MazMHussain That is the op section. I would never have run this. You are making sweeping statements about our ME coverage though &amp; I can't allow it. You are smearing the ME team in London's work by alleging we propagate the Israeli govt. The Israeli watchdogs would disagree with you too.

@PatrickHilsman @MazMHussain I see them as balanced. Israelis would disagree with some aspects. Palestinians would disagree with some aspects. But, if followed, they have kept us from getting bashed by all sides, from retractions and from firings, which is their purpose.
@PatrickHilsman @MazMHussain I'm not challenging you on that stuff.
@PatrickHilsman @MazMHussain These guidelines weren't made by the regime you are railing against. They were made by Matt McAllester who was a bureau chief &amp; corro in the region for years, with more experience than you and I put together. I've stayed quiet too but I had to challenge you on this.
@PatrickHilsman @MazMHussain Yes please do. You quit on day one because you care about facts. These guidelines aim for the reporting to be as factual as possible, but you're annoyed with them? It's good you have your own worldview, but don't shit on a place and reporters for trying to be balanced.
@PatrickHilsman @MazMHussain Please publish them. I was ME reporter for over two years &amp; take offence at what you are saying. You're questioning my integrity as a reporter. Our coverage was its worst when these were not followed and writer's bias crept in. You wouldn't know because you were here for...a day.
@PatrickHilsman @MazMHussain Show me a reputable publication that calls Gaza occupied? By definition it is not. On the WB, you're omitting whole chunks of text to make your point. It says we can call WB "occupied" but not the whole of it because of Area A. Read the Oslo Accords.
@PatrickHilsman @MazMHussain It says to refer to the structure collectively as a barrier. Then to call sections of wall exactly that, to call sections of fence a fence, ie precise reporting. Say what you want about other stuff, but you're totally wrong on this and should delete this tweet.
@PatrickHilsman @MazMHussain Sorry but this is just a complete lie that has to be challenged. The guidelines literally state do not call Israel the Jewish State, do not call Pal attackers 'terrorists' and do not call Jerusalem Israel's capital, ALL govt positions. What bloody guidelines were your reading?

Pence tells the Israeli parliament that the U.S. embassy will move to Jerusalem "before the end of next year." (2019)
Arab lawmakers, who said they would boycott Pence's speech, waved placards and were ejected from the parliament.
Netanyahu tells Pence that Trump's Jerusalem embassy move is one of most momentous decisions in the history of Zionism.
Netanyahu compares Trump's decision to relocate the U.S. embassy to the Balfour Declaration, the British document that pledged support for a homeland of the Jewish people.
Netanyahu tells Pence: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fitting that you are the first American Vice President to speak at the Knesset in Jerusalem, fitting because no American Vice President has had a greater commitment to Israel and its people.‚Äù

Kerry: YADA YADA YADA YADA YADA YADA YADA YADA YADA YADA
Kerry says Jerusalem should be the capital for both states in any final agreement.
Kerry has almost spoken for an hour and we're just reaching what he wants both sides to do. Mammoth speech.
Kerry says US will not push for UN resolution on parameters for Israeli-Palestinian peace or recognition of Palestine before Obama leaves.
Kerry: The attacks by the Israeli government on the US distracts attention from what this resolution is all about: the settlements.
Kerry: The US was not behind the UN resolution on settlements. It was drafted and promoted by Egypt and the Palestinians
Kerry: It's not this resolution isolating Israel, it's the permanent policy of settlement construction that makes peace impossible.
Kerry: What happens if that agenda succeeds? Where does that lead? There are millions of Palestinians living under occupation.
Kerry: Ministers who oppose a Palestinian state are "increasingly getting their way."
Kerry: The settler agenda is defining the future of Israel. They believe in one state: Greater Israel.
Kerry: "The more outposts are built, the less possible it is to create a contiguous state."
Kerry: Outpost legalization bill is a "major step toward annexation."
Kerry: "Let's be clear: settlement expansion has nothing to do with Israel's security."
Kerry says current Israeli government most right-wing in Israeli history, directed by the most extreme elements in Israeli society.
Kerry: There is absolutely no justification for terrorism, and there never will be.
Kerry: "Trends on the ground" combining to destroy peace on both sides. Refers to Palestinian "incitement," Israeli "settlement-building."
Kerry says end to Israeli-Palestinian conflict still possible if "responsible parties are willing to act."
Kerry: The US did vote in accordance with our values (at the UN).
Kerry warns that the future of the two-state solution is "now in jeopardy."
Kerry says two-state solution is the only way to achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians.

Samantha Power, US rep at UN, says "one cannot champion both settlements and the two-state solution."

Trump on ISIS: "I will secretly sneak attack and grab them bigly by the p**** in Mosul sniff sniff Islamic terror sniff."
There is nothing new about Clinton's strategy against ISIS. Everything she says is already happening. #debate
Clinton calls for the arming of the Kurdish Peshmerga in northern Iraq. The U.S. is already arming them and has been for a year. #debate
