If you'd like to support Neubauer, you can give to her campaign today: https://t.co/YJCznEzN1I
Meanwhile, her opponent, conservative Judge Brian Hagedorn, is an extremist who authored Wisconsin's infamout "Act 10" that gutted public sector unions. He's also a hatemonger who despises gay people https://t.co/gZn0yk11jC
That's why we're endorsing Neubauer now. She's served on the Wisconsin Court of Appeals with distinction for over a decade and will be just as fair-minded on the Supreme Court
It's a two-step process: This year, progressives need to defend the seat held by retiring Justice Shirley Abrahamson, a revered liberal figure who was the first woman on the court. Then, a year from now, they need to unseat conservative justice Dan Kelly, a Scott Walker appointee
Currently, conservatives hold a 4-3 majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. But progressives can flip that around ahead of the next round of redistricting that will follow the 2020 census. That'll be crucial to help thwart future Republican gerrymandering

A special thanks to whoever RT’d this thread into MAGA-land. Our mentions are filled with tweets like this now https://t.co/srF2gpIoSc
But while this ruling may not stand up on appeal, it points the way to holding lawmakers accountable for illegal gerrymanders and making them pay a price for denying voters their constitutional rights
Republicans across the country have willfully passed gerrymanders they know will be struck down because there's no price to pay: They win majorities, pass whatever laws they like, and then, at worst, have to run under new maps at some distant point in the future
This ruling is extraordinary but not without precedent: In 1964, a federal court in Connecticut enjoined the state legislature, which had been elected using unconstitutional districts, from passing any laws until it had reconstituted itself under new maps https://t.co/VVTuFlGtI0
The court said that because of this gerrymander (which was struck down in a separate case), the legislature had "lost its claim to popular sovereignty" and therefore could not place amendments to the state constitution on the ballot https://t.co/5swRKkL6gZ

One final note: We give open seats a "House margin" of 0, to reflect the loss of incumbency advantages. So every time there's a retirement, we adjust the HVI accordingly to see how a seat moves up the index. Bookmark our spreadsheet and you'll always be up to date!
You can find our full spreadsheet for 2020 here, with all members of both parties ranked from most to least vulnerable: https://t.co/xOWtIEdZdJ
We've updated the 2018 version of our spreadsheet to denote all the seats that changed hands. Almost all of them are at the top of the HVI https://t.co/oX9YibYfSb https://t.co/oCyXwiikIF
In 2018, it worked very well! And not just because of the Dem wave: It accurately forecast which seats the GOP was likeliest to pick up, too https://t.co/KEIcOpnBI7
Importantly, the HVI doesn’t predict how many seats will be lost in the next election, and it doesn’t predict whether or not a particular seat will be lost. What it does, though, is predict the order in which seats will fall.
And despite getting blasted last year, there are still some vulnerable Republicans out there, meaning the Democratic majority could grow in 2020 with another decent year https://t.co/PDm6eqVpqS
Here's what the top 10 (incl. ties) look like for Democrats. Unsurprisingly, it's largely freshman in seats that had previously tilted GOP https://t.co/h2QwXKFivE
The HVI is very simple. It looks at just two things: the presidential lean of a district, and the results of the last House election. It ranks both of these then combines them into a single score, which we then re-rank to give us the vulnerability rating of each district https://t.co/TABgj9Qoa3

Since Mississippi Republicans aren’t in any hurry to repeal this racist relic of the Jim Crow era, the only way for voting rights advocates to defang it is to challenge it in court now—before it’s too late.
And don't think this law is just dead letter. It was enforced as recently as the 1999 #MSGOV race. https://t.co/QHu52y0TYH
If a Dem #MSGOV candidate wins the most votes but fails to win a majority of the vote AND a majority of the 122 state House seats, don't expect GOP-dominated House not to make a Republican governor. In 2016 they seated a Republican who had LOST a tiebreaking vote https://t.co/JYSlhcnSEA

And don't expect GOP state House to just do the right thing and pick whoever won most votes to be #MSGOV. In 2016, they ignored own tiebreaking procedure and installed a GOP state rep who had lost by drawing the short straw. Court did NOT intervene https://t.co/2kFnZCFGRd
Some have argued this Jim Crow law can't be enforced, but that's hardly clear. Only way to find out is if matter went to court. But voting rights advocates can't just sit by and hope this law will just get struck down or not enforced in first place: Risk just too great
This law stacks the deck against Democrats, but just how badly? As Dem AG Jim Hood's 2015 re-election shows, very badly. Hood is running for #MSGOV now https://t.co/cCMnAtBxtn
Mississippi has a Jim Crow law that requires candidates for statewide office win a majority of the vote AND a majority of the 122 state House seats. If they don't hit BOTH goals, GOP-led state House gets to pick governor https://t.co/JFleY15vcW
A Jim Crow law requires #MSGOV nominees to win both a majority of the statewide vote and a majority of the 122 districts that make up the state House. If no one hits BOTH goals, GOP-led state House picks governor https://t.co/h0XZhuM64l
It may not be too late for voting rights advocates to go to court to remove this ugly remnant of the Jim Crow era from the books. But Election Day is Nov. 5, so the clock is ticking loudly. https://t.co/JFleY15vcW
This Jim Crow law was put on the books in 1890 to hurt black voters, and that's exactly what it would do this very year if a Dem won the most votes statewide but failed to become governor. #MSGOV https://t.co/JFleY15vcW
In 2015, the median seat favored #MSGOV Phil Bryant 74-25, which is about 16 points to the right of the state as a whole. That makes it very tough for Dems to win a majority of the state House unless they're already winning the popular vote by a landslide https://t.co/JFleY15vcW
In Dem AG Jim Hood's 2015 re-election campaign, he won 55-45 and carried 66/122 House seats. Seems fine ... until you see the median seat backed Hood just 51.6-48.4, about 7.5 points to the right of his statewide win. https://t.co/JFleY15vcW
A Jim Crow law requires a #MSGOV candidate to win a majority of the vote AND a majority of the state House districts, or else the legislature chooses the new governor. That's a big hurdle for Dems, but just HOW big? https://t.co/JFleY15vcW

@KeithGiesler The largest number of House seats picked up by Democrats in a single election since 1974 https://t.co/9uxBka5R1K
What Kihuen calls “immaturity and overconfidence” includes suggesting to a firm’s employee that he would help advance her career if they were in a relationship, touching a campaign staffer’s thigh, and telling a lobbyist that they should make a sex tape. https://t.co/3ws5cJKoni

Florida giving Dems a familiar case of deju vu. Republicans narrowly up and more of South Florida isn't closing the gap.

NBC calls #IN02 for GOP Rep. Jacky Walorski. Always a longshot Dem target at 59% Trump, never got much national attention

The AP has called #FL07 for Dem Rep. Stephanie Murphy. GOP talked about targeting her early in cycle in 51-44 Clinton seat, but they had other problems.
On the other hand, early votes in Duval (Jacksonville) look beyond awesome for Dems. Nelson 53-47, Gillum 54-45. Trump won entire county 48-47, which was in itself a weak result for the GOP.
Polls have closed in North Carolina, Ohio, and West Virginia.
Early Miami-Dade votes so far aren't as rosy for Dems. Clinton won county 62-34, earlies have Nelson 60-40, Gillum 59-38. #FLGOV #FLSEN
Early voting in Seminole (Orlando burbs) gives both Nelson and Gillum about 4-5% lead: Trump won it by 1.5%. But again, very little Election Day vote in there

John Liu hanging onto 52-48 lead over Tony Avella (IDC) with 89% in
State Sen. David Carlucci (IDC) looking in far better shape than most of his compatriots. Leads Julie Goldberg 56-44 with 34% in
NY LG Kathy Hochul has pulled ahead 51-49 with 56% reporting. She's been gaining ground as more of upstate comes in, and it makes up most of what's left unreported

Some things never change. Polls closed nearly an hour and not a vote from Nassau County.
Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul may not be done yet. Trails Jumaane Williams 52-48 with 37% in and a lot of upstate left to go, while most of NYC is in.

So much for that. 71% in and Simcha Felder leads 63-37 in his Dem primary. Felder, who caucuses with GOP, also unopposed in GOP primary
69% in, and Jessica Ramos leads state Sen. and former IDC member Jose Peralta 54-46 in Dem primary

Julia Salazar, who has attracted more media attention than perhaps any state legislative candidate in American history, leads 55-45 in her Dem state Senate primary with 48% in
IDC chief Jeff Klein has dropped a lot in his primary. 51% in and he leads Dem primary challenger Alessandra Biaggi 52-48
State Sen. Simcha Felder's position has stabilized a bit. 43% in and Felder, a Dem who caucuses with GOP, leads primary 54-46
4 members of the IDC, a group of Dems who kept GOP in charge of state Senate, currently trail their Dem primaries. But leader Jeff Klein up 56-44 with 22% in
In Dem primary, state Sen. Simcha Felder (caucuses with GOP) up just 52-48 with 28% in. This would be a huge wow moment if he lost

Want something really crazy, though? Republicans haven't won a downballot statewide race in Maryland since *1918*, when Alexander Armstrong won a term as attorney general
Texas hasn't elected *any* Dem statewide since 1994, the longest streak in the nation, when Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock was re-elected (along with a few other Dems)
But, because this is DKE, we get way further down into the weeds. What if you want to know the last time a D/R was elected to some other statewide office, like Lt. Gov., AG, or SoS? We've got you covered. (Note that we only list the "highest" office if there's a tie)
For governors, South Dakota hasn't elected a Dem since 1974, while Washington holds the opposite record: It hasn't elected a Republican governor since 1980
Hawaii's on the longest "no Republican senators" streak (1970), with New Jersey close behind (1972)
Some interesting data pops out. The longest Republican winning streak for the Senate is in Kansas, which hasn't elected a Democrat since 1932! The next-longest streaks are in Utah and Wyoming (both 1970)
So you can see the last time major-party candidates were elected senator, governor, or to statewide partisan office in all 50 states
Introducing our newest data set—and our newest member of the @DKElections team: @Matt_DKE! Matt and @hellofasandwich have put together this chart showing the last time a Democrat or Republican was elected statewide in each state: https://t.co/v95wpRtigB

The USPS also asked for the information to be returned, but not only is it already out there, the Congressional Leadership Fund eagerly made use of material hacked by Russians last cycle, so they won't have any problem using an improperly disclosed security application

GOP primary for #FL15 suddenly got a LOT closer. With about half of election day votes in, Spano leads Combee 40-37. For Dems its still Carlson 55-31
@jeremybowers Is it possible to obtain House results by county on your site?
Election Day voting is helping Gillum close the gap some. With 931,000 votes in (early votes from most counties plus 41% of precincts), it's Graham 34-30,
Dem #FLGOV primary suddenly got a bit closer. With 866,000 votes in, Graham leads Gillum 34-29.
Safely red #FL17 looking like a landslide for NRA and Club for Growth-backed state Sen. Greg Steube. 44,000 votes in and he's up 61-21
Things pretty lopsided for both sides in open #FL15 with over 20,000 counted in each primary. For GOP state Rep. Ross Spano up 54-24. For Dems, attorney Kristen Carlson up 56-30
17,000 votes counted in #FL07 GOP primary, and state Rep. Mike Miller up 59-27. Winner faces freshman Dem Stephanie Murphy in competitive seat

767,000 Dem #FLGOV votes in (a lot of early votes, plus 23% of Election Say precincts), and its Graham 35, Gillum 27. Gillum has made up a little ground, but nothing dramatic.
About 15,000 mostly early votes in #FL18 Dem primary, and national party fav Lauren Baer up 66-34. GOP Rep. Brian Mast awaits
With about 17,000 early votes counted in #FL27 Dem primary, Donna Shalala leads state Rep. David Richardson 32-27. So far, closer than Richardson's own poll showed.
675,000 Dem votes for #FLGOV primary, and Graham maintains 36-26 lead over Gillum. Early votes in Leon, where they're both from, favoring Graham 45-37.
About 31,000 votes counted in Dem primary for safe #FL05, and Rep. Al Lawson leads former Jacksonville Mayor Alvin Brown 57-43.
Alan Grayson's second comeback flaming out. With 27,000 votes in (including a third of Election Day precincts), Rep. Soto's beating him 67-33 in Dem primary #FL09
About 580,000 Dem #FLGOV votes in (well over half 2014 Dem primary total) and its Graham over Gillum 35-26. Still mostly early votes: Gillum depending on strong Election Day showing.
For all the Twitter buzz Rep. Stephanie Murphy's Dem primary got in #FL07, she's up 87-13 with 21,000 votes in
20,000 votes counted in GOP primary for #FL015, and it's state Rep. Ross Spano 55-25. May be best known for sponsoring resolution calling porn a "public health risk" and expressing "the need for education, prevention, research and policy change to protect citizens of this state."
GOP primary in safely red #FL17 looking very good for Club For Growth-backed Greg Steube. With 18,000 votes in, he leads Rubio-endorsed Julio Gonzalez 60-23.
GOP #FLGOV continues to look like a blowout for Trump-backed Ron DeSantis. With close to 500,000 votes in, he's up 57-36
A lot of Hillsborough (Tampa), Orange (Orlando), and Palm Beach early vote just came in. With 382,000 votes in for #FLGOV Dems statewide, its Graham 36, now Gillum 24
Florida is counting fast. About 190,000 Dem votes in for #FLGOV, (still almost all early votes) and Graham leads Levine 39-23. But still don't have much from big counties, including South Florida where Levine needs to do well
116,000 mostly early votes in for #FLGOV Dem primary and Gwen Graham leading Philip Levine 39-22, Andrew Gillum at 19. But not much from most of the big counties.
Over 23,000 early votes counted in each of #FL06 primaries. For GOP, former Dick Cheney advisor Michael Waltz up 42-31 on ex-Rep. Fred Costello. For Dems, national fav Nancy Soderberg up 55-24.
Early votes in #FL09 Dem primary very good for Rep. Darren Soto. Leading ex-Rep. Alan Grayson 66-34 with 13,000 votes (half of total for 2014 primary) in
106,000 votes counted for #FLGOV GOP primary, almost all early votes. Ron DeSantis up 61-32
Today in the AP counts election results in a weird way: 62,000 votes in for GOP's #FLSEN primary, just 1,700 votes in for GOP's #FLGOV primary.
Getting our first votes in #FLGOV. Remember: Friends don't let friends overreact to really small vote totals
Unlike many other states, Florida tends to count quickly, especially the early vote. In the 2016 primary, we had EVs from Pinellas County by 7:10 PM ET and from Miami-Dade (the biggest county) by 7:20

Others come up less often but are still quite important. For instance, did a pollster allow respondents to say they were undecided? Did they identify candidates with their party ID? Were they in the field too long? These are all things we consider, and much more.
Some are pretty basic, like do we know the pollster's name? A lot of publications will describe polls without that key detail, though. We won't. Pollster transparency and reputation is more important than secret polls.

Stat: There are just *three* GOP-held House seats that Dems aren't contesting this year (vs. 39 Dem seats the GOP has left uncontested). That's the lowest for any party in over a decade, and perhaps longer (compiled by @DonnerMaps) https://t.co/SgjWyxchwQ

Morning Digest: Tim Pawlenty's comeback bid for Minnesota governor fizzles in GOP primary #MNGOV https://t.co/F9bpbo3dhc
For all the trolling emails @The_RGA puts out whenever a Dem frontrunner so much as sneezes, nothing out yet even mentioning Jeff Johnson now that he's beaten their favored candidate
Rocky De La Fuente was on the ballot in GOP primaries for both #MNSEN and #VTSEN tonight; he got over 5,000 more votes losing in MN than the guy who bet him got in VT
Daily Kos Congratulates Dick Uihlein for Lighting $11 Million on Fire #WISen #pressrelease
To think, if Tim Pawlenty had just run for #MNSEN special, he'd put off losing by almost 3 months! #MNGOV
The AP has called #MN01 for Jim Hagedorn, who was Team Red's nominee in 2014 and 2016. Will take on Dem Dan Feehan in seat that swung from 50-48 Obama to 53-39 Trump
This is Jim Hagedorn, the GOP's (again) nominee in competitive #MN01 https://t.co/DfdhduZHyP https://t.co/iYR10uoce6
Still no AP call in #MN01 GOP primary, but the writing is on the wall and reaching the ceiling. 2014/2016 nominee Jim Hagedorn up 60-33 with 83% in
The AP has called #MN08 Dem primary for former state Rep. Joe Radinovich. Will face challenging race for ancestrally Dem Iron Range seat that swung from 52-46 Obama to 54-39 Trump
Paul Nehlen, who is the one guy who found out how to get Nazis banned on Twitter, taking third place in #WI01 GOP primary with 11% of the vote.
Pawlenty outraised Jeff Johnson $2.1 million to $300,000 during first 7 months of 2017, had $1 million to $193,000 cash-on-hand edge in late July, and still went badly lost #MNGOV primary https://t.co/CruSWCyNvP
So ... your move, @The_RGA https://t.co/HYxMLjYw4X https://t.co/EiwjRehYxD
The AP calls #MNGOV Dem primary for Tim Walz. Looks like the early favorite against surprise GOP nominee Jeff Johnson
Tim Pawlenty has now lost two high profile races this decade. The second one probably mattered a whole lot more. #MNGOV https://t.co/spRrwx6icC
The AP has called #MNGOV GOP for Jeff Johnson, putting a surprising end to Tim Pawlenty's comeback bid.
AP calls #CTGOV GOP primary for Bob Stefanowski. Will face Ned Lamont in November in competitive contest
Now 60% reporting in #MNGOV and Walz lead up to 43-33 for Dems, Jeff Johnson still leads T-Paw 53-44.
RT @ArjunJaikumar: Looks like Minnesota voters decided two terms was Pawlenty.
51% reporting in #MNGOV primaries. For GOP, still Jeff Johnson 53-44 over T-Paw. For Dems Walz leads Murphy 42-34, Swanson 23
72% reporting in #CTGOV GOP primary and wealthy businessman Bob Stefanowski up 30-22 in 5-way contest.
The AP calls #WISEN GOP primary for state Sen. Leah Vukmir, the party establishment's preferred candidate. GOP groups have already spent heavily against Tammy Baldwin, but this isn't looking like a great target for them this cycle
30% in for GOP in competitive #MN01 and Team Red seems to have Jim Hagedorn as nominee for third time. Up 62-30
25% in Dem primary for competitive #MN08 and its still former state Rep. Joe Radinovich 48-22
Now up to 41% reporting in #MNGOV. For GOP its Jeff Johnson 53-44; not getting THAT much closer for T-Paw so far. For Dems its Walz over Murphy 42-35, about where its been most of the night; Swanson 22
AP calls #CT05 GOP primary for Manny Santos. Team Red tried hard to find a strong candidate for 50-46 Clinton seat, but Santos has raised just $25,000 for his whole campaign.

AP calls #MNAG Dem primary for Keith Ellison. His ex-girlfriend publicly accused him of physical abuse days before Election Day, which he denied.
43% in for #WISEN GOP primary and establishment-backed Leah Vukmir leads Kevin Nicholson 56-39. Nicholson got $10 mil in spending from groups backed by megadonor Richard Uihlein, but had trouble accounting for long past as a Democrat
60% reporting in #CTGOV and rich guy Bob Stefanowski leads Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton 30-22, a bit larger than what he's had for a while.
31% reporting for #MNGOV primaries. For GOP its Jeff Johnson 53-44 over Pawlenty. For Dems its still Walz 41-35 over Murphy, Swanson at 22
13% reporting from GOP #MN01 primary, and 2014/2016 nominee Jim Hagedorn leads state Sen. Carla Nelson 66-25
AP calls #WI01 Dem primary for Randy Bryce. Will take on Paul Ryan ally Bryan Steil for speaker's open seat.
26% in #MNGOV and GOP primary still stands at Johnson leading T-Paw 54-43.
RT @ForecasterEnten: At least Evan Bayh made it to the general election #timpawlenty
The AP has called #WIGOV Dem primary for Tony Evers. Will face off against the well-funded GOP Gov. Scott Walker in what will be a very closely-watched race.
11% reporting in #MN08 Dem primary and former state Rep. Joe Radinovich up 49-21
The AP has called  Dem primary for safely blue #MN05 Ilhan Omar. Will be first Somali-American member of Congress, as well as first Muslim woman along with #MI13's Rashida Tlaib
Say what you will about Tim Pawlenty's comeback campaign, but he very much did take Jeff Johnson seriously. T-Paw's very first TV ad was an attack on Johnson https://t.co/dzhEfRiLnD
22% in #MNAG DEM primary and Keith Ellison up 54-16. His old seat makes up big share of results, but it seems unlikely he'll lose in 5-way race.
#WIGOV Dem primary has 23% reporting and frontrunner Tony Evers is frontrunning his way to a 42-19 lead. In #WISEN GOP primary, Leah Vukmir up 56-38 in what would be an upset.
21% in #MNGOV GOP primary and Jeff Johnson leads Tim Pawlenty 55-43. Most of Johnson's Hennepin base is in, but this is looking serious. For Dems, Tim Walz leads Erin Murphy 41-36.
84% in #MN05 Dem primary, and Omar coming. State Rep. Ilhan Omar leads 48-31 in safely blue Minneapolis seat.
43% in #CTGOV GOP primary and Bob Stefanowski maintains the 28-24 lead he's held over Mark Boughton for a while.
RT @dwbeard: Trying to filter every single Dem primary into a Bernie vs establishment frame is dumb
The AP has called special #MNSEN Dem primary for Tina Smith. Richard Painter got a lot of attention for tweets, trailing 76-14 with 14% in.
30% reporting in Dem primary for #WI01, and Randy Bryce leads Cathy Myers 58-42
The AP has called #CT05 Dem primary for Jahana Hayes, the 2016 National Teacher of the Year. Strong favorite in November, and would be first black woman to represent the state in Congress.
10% in #WIGOV Dem primary, and Tony Evers leading Mahlon Mitchell 37-26. In GOP #WISEN primary Leah Vukmir leads Kevin Nicholson 58-38
We're already at 58% reporting in #MN05 Dem primary! Ilhan Omar	leads 47-32 for safely blue seat
10% reporting in #MNGOV primaries. For Dems, Walz leads Murphy 41-36. For GOP, Jeff Johnson leads Tim Pawlenty 55-42. It's really early, but a Johnson win would be HUGE upset
31% reporting in #CTGOV GOP primary, and rich guy Bob Stefanowski still has small 28-25 lead over Danbury Mayor Boughton, the state party endorsed candidate
12% reporting in #MN05 Dem primary, and Ilhan Omar up 46-32 over former state House Speaker Margaret Anderson Kelliher
3% in for #MNGOV GOP primary and Jeff Johnson leads Pawlenty. Remember, Phil Scott was down in #VTGOV after 3% in, so be cautious.
AP calls #VTGOV Dem primary for Christine Hallquist. First trans nominee for governor in any state, though very uphill battle in November.
AP calls #VTGOV GOP primary for Gov. Phil Scott. Leads 66-34 with almost half of precincts in.
23% reporting in #CT05 Dem primary and 2016 National Teacher of the Year Jahana Hayes still up 65-35. Would be first black woman to represent the state.

Boughton's big jump was from his Danbury base, which is now 100% in. Probably not a good sign for him that he's still trailing though #CTGOV
Now 20% reporting in #CTGOV GOP primary and rich guy Bob Stefanowski leads Danbury Mayor and state party endorsed candidate Mark Boughton just 28-25
As a certain unmissed former Connecticut senator might put it, we currently have a 3-way split decision for second place! #CTGOV https://t.co/mKw4dtxeLw
10% reporting in #CT05 Dem primary and 2016 Teacher of the Year Jahana Hayes leads ex-Simsbury First Selectwoman Mary Glassman 66-34. For GOP, very underfunded former Meridian Mayor Manny Santos up 42-33.
Meanwhile in #KSGOV, GOP GOv. Jeff Colyer has just conceded ultra-tight primary to Secretary of State Kris Kobach rather than go through recount.
11% reporting in #CTGOV GOP primary and very rich guy Bob Stefanowski leads ultra rich guy David Stemerman 31-19.
AP has already called #CTGOV Dem primary for Ned Lamont. Let's just say this Dem primary victory was a lot less dramatic than his one 12 years ago.
And once again, only one of them is actually running as a Dem. Bernie Sanders will, for the third time, decline the Dem nod and stay an indy https://t.co/17AAB24nnd https://t.co/ShTpBxkg40
Now we're at 20% reporting in #VTGOV GOP primary and incumbent Phil Scott up 62-38. That was a fun few minutes when ultra-early results showed him trailing, wasn't it?
The AP has called the #VTSEN Dem primary for Bernie Sanders, the father of #NH01 Dem candidate Levi Sanders.
Getting our first few precincts in #CTGOV, 2% reporting. If #VTGOV has taught us nothing, and it hasn't, it's to wait for a lot more before trying to analyze the results
10% of precincts reporting in #VTGOV GOP primary and Phil Scott up 63-37. He had an early scare when there were only a few hundred votes in, but looking a lot more secure now that we have close to 4,800 counted.
#VTGOV Phil Scott went from narrowly trailing with 3% of precincts in to ahead 62-38 with 8% of precincts in, another reminder for why everyone should just wait for plenty of votes (we recommend at least 10% of precincts) to come in before getting excited

32% in #KSGOV, and Colyer back to 41.2-39.5 lead over Kobach. Kobach seemed to have momentum even before Trump endorsed him, so a loss would be a real surprise
95% in #OH12 and Balderson back on top by 741 votes. Almost all of what's left is Delaware, which has been helping him make up ground.
We're tracking the winners in tonight's big races in our handy cheat sheet https://t.co/a53lFQamAC
The AP has called #MIGOV Dem primary for former state Senate Minority Leader Gretchen Whitmer. Will take on Attorney General Bill Schuette in a top Dem pickup opportunity
91% in #OH12 and O'Connor up 201 votes as all but one Franklin precinct comes in. Now needs to hope whats left of Delaware ok or a lot of Dem friendly provisionals out there
20% reporting in Missouri, and the anti-labor "right to work" law going down 63-37
25% in #KSGOV GOP and Kobach now leads incumbent Colyer 41.5-39.0. For Dems, state Sen. Laura Kelly up 53-24
89% in and more of Delaware gets Balderson to a 50.0-49.4 lead, margin of 1,031 votes. Delaware still most of whats left #OH12
32% in #KS02 GOP primary and Steve Watkins, whom one rival called "a charlatan, a fraud and an opportunist," up 28-21
The AP just fixed a big error in #OH12. Now 85% in #OH12, O'Connor up just 155 votes, seems more Delaware hurt him a lot. 77 precincts remain in Delaware, 13 in Franklin.
RT @kkondik: yup https://t.co/zq6PbxCs0A
81% reporting in #OH12 and O'Connor up 50.1-49.3, margin of 1,433. Of remaining 114 precincts, 97 in Delaware.
11% reporting in #KSGOV GOP primary and Jeff Colyer holding 40-39 lead over Kris Kobach, whom Trump endorsed yesterday.
The AP has called #MIGOV GOP primary for Attorney General Bill Schuette, aka the guy whose name Trump misspelled in endorsement tweet
74% in #OH12 and O'Connor retakes lead at 50-49 thanks to more Franklin votes. Of 154 precincts left, 121 are in Delaware
11% in for each party's primaries in open #MI11. For Dems its Stevens 27, Gupta 22, Greimel 21. For GOP it's Epstein 30, Rocky 24, Kowall 20.
13% of #KS02 GOP primary in and Steve Watkins, whose dad self-funded a super PAC for him, up 29-20
Of remaining 200 precincts, 121 in Delaware, 69 in Franklin. O'Connor better hope that the Delaware areas that just came in were from really red portions. #OH12
66% reporting in #OH12 and Balderson has taken a 50-49 lead for first time. More Delaware County pushed him ahead, which is NOT a good sign for O'Connor.
54% in #OH12 and O'Connor lead down to 51-48. A batch of Delaware County pushed him down, which seems like an ominous sign in a county he's hoping to do well in
44% in #MI06 Dem primary to take on entrenched GOP Rep. Fred Upton, and former YMCA health guru Matt Longjohn up 40-25
294 precincts, about half of total, remain uncounted in #OH12. Of uncounted ones, 69 in O'Connor's Franklin, 59 in red counties, 156 in wildcard Delaware.
We've hit 50% of precincts in #OH12, O'Connor's lead unchanged at 52-47. The bad news for him was a large chuck of Franklin came in and didn't change his margin. The good news for him is almost all of Balderson's Muskingum in
11% of precincts reporting in #MIGOV, and looks very one-sided for frontrunners. For Dems, Whitmer 50-34. For GOP, Schuette 51-23.
With 36% of precincts in #OH12, O’Connor up 52-47, margin of 4,330 votes. More of Licking came in and helped Balderson. About 2/3 of Licking is in now and O'Connor trails 59-41 there; we think he can lose it about 56-39 to win districtwide.
With 31% of precincts reporting (plus early votes) in all of #OH12, O'Connor holds 53-46 lead. A good chunk of conservative Licking County came in, which gave Balderson a big boost.
About two-thirds of Morrow is in, and O'Connor down 69-30 there. We think he needs to keep his loss to 67-29 there. so a good sign for him #OH12
All of Marion County is in, and GOP's 67-32 lead is a little better for O'Connor than the 66-30 we think he can lose it by. But it's just 1% of the district, so \0/
Gotta ask: Do people in Delaware County, OH call it DelCo, or is that just a Pennsylvania thing?
Now 9% of #OH12 Election Day precincts plus early votes in, and its O'Connor 57-43. The good news for him is about 1/3 of precincts in Balderson's Muskingum base are already in. But no E-Day from Critical Delaware County (TM)
1% of precincts reporting in #MIGOV Dem primary, and Too Little Data leads Just Wait For More Votes 49-43, Excitement Over a Few Precincts takes 8 (some rounding)
Early votes are in, but only 4% of Election Day precincts. O’Connor up 61-38, but there's still far more we don't know out of #OH12 than what we do know.
For those keeping score at home, we're getting our first handful of votes out of Missouri and Michigan too.
Finally getting election day votes our of #OH12. Only about 10/591 precincts, far too little to know anything
We got 102 votes counted in #KSGOV. As they say, as one precinct in Geary County goes, so goes the nation. Actually, no one said that until now.
Polls have closed in Missouri and in most of #KSGOV and #MIGOV. Parts of those two states stay open till 9 ET, so no statewide calls at least until then.
RT @kkondik: About 8700 total votes. For reference, county cast about 59k in 2014. So still a LOT of votes left in that county, even if spe…
One good sign for O'Connor is that so far, his Franklin County base makes up more than 1/3 of early votes counted. We estimated it will be about 32% of TOTAL vote, so if it's turning out in bigger numbers, Dems will be happy #OH12 https://t.co/eZ9ByI2M8F
Now 36,000 early votes from across #OH12 and O'Connor up 63-37. No Election Day voting in yet.
Now up to 27,000 early votes counted, and O'Connor leads 64-35. Still far too early to know much, though: GOP will do considerably better for Election Day votes, which will be the bulk of total vote #OH12
RT @Nate_Cohn: After careful analysis of the early vote, the needle is not budging https://t.co/epUu5Vbs10
About 6,600 early votes counted in conservative Licking, and Balderson leads 50-48 there. But as many have said, Dems will do well in early votes, so too early to read into this #OH12
About 14,000 early votes quickly counted in Franklin, and O'Connor leads 80-14 there. We were expecting him to dominate early voting there, but this is still a big margin. But of course it's reaaallllyyyy early #OH2 https://t.co/qKbhrKIIKj
You'll want to have our #OH12 county benchmarks handy to get a sense for whether or not O'Connor is doing what he needs to do in each of the seven counties to win https://t.co/eZ9ByI2M8F https://t.co/DLP05HymGt

RT @michaelschwab13: A look at the Diane Black watch party. She is current trailing Bill Lee by 16 points https://t.co/iAm0Tt670S
#TN02 has gotten a bit closer. 60,000 votes in and Knox County Mayor Tim Burchett leads state Rep. Jimmy Matlock 46-38
Tennessee seems to be taking their ganja break, or rather, Jack Daniels break, now. Been a while since we got new votes.
Mike Pence picked an interesting GOP primary to stick his neck out for. He backed Rep. Diane Black on Friday, she's a distant third with 21% now #TNGOV
AP calls #TNGOV Dem primary for former Nashville Mayor Karl Dean. Will face uphill race in the fall, but could make things interesting.
GOP primary for #TN02 (hasn't elected a Dem since before Civil War) still looking like a landslide for Knox County Mayor Tim Burchett. Up 48-37 with 53,000 votes in.
About 275,000 votes counted in #TNGOV GOP primary and still Lee 36-27. That's about a third of 2010 total even though AP says just 1% of precincts reporting.
Don't liveblog the Tennessee GOP primary, they said. Nothing interesting will happen, they said. https://t.co/RlloZR646C https://t.co/yCVNTI1ZnT

Now 200,000 #TNGOV GOP votes in (STILL almost all early votes) and its Bill Lee 36-27 over Randy Boyd. Getting a little closer, but not tight.
#TNGOV GOP leader Bill Lee benefited from some unusual form of advertising. While he was running for governor, his company aired commercials staring ... Bill Lee https://t.co/Rr39n99Uyh
11,000 early votes in #TN08 GOP primary, and Rep. David Kustoff leads rich perennial candidate George Flinn by meh 53-42. Trump's endorsement may have ended up saving him.
122,000 votes in for #TNGOV GOP primary (still almost all early votes) and Lee up 37-26 over Boyd. A little closer than before, but not looking like a cliffhanger
#TNGOV Dem primary looking very lopsided. 59,000 votes in and former Nashville Mayor Karl Dean leads state House Minority Leader Craig Fitzhugh 81-16.
We've hit 100,000 votes in #TNGOV GOP primary (while only 1% of precincts in, this is a lot of early votes) and Bill Lee up 38-25. He'd led in exactly one released poll https://t.co/nNnTYym53w
11,000 votes counted in #TN06 GOP primary (mostly early votes) and former state Agriculture Commissioner John Rose leads former Judge Bob Corlew 49-32 in safely red seat.
88,000 votes counted for #TNGOV GOP (mostly early votes, not much election day) and Bill Lee leads fellow businessman Randy Boyd 39-23. Mike-Pence backed Diane Black at 20.
Today in the AP is weird: 46,000 votes counted in Dem #TNSEN primary, just 8,000 counted for Dem #TNGOV primary, GOP races about even.

Marist finds all three #MNGOV Dems beating Tim Pawlenty by 8-11 points, but we still don't have much data from this race https://t.co/7BlPbzQbzp
Is #MIGOV GOP primary close or a blowout? Marist has Schuette leading Calley just 33-26, EPIC-MRA has him up 42-24 https://t.co/PYfJD7jWl8
Marist and EPIC-MRA have VERY different reads on #MIGOV primaries. For Dems, Marist has Whitmer leading Thanedar 31-27, El-Sayed 22. EPIC-MRA has Whitmer beating Thanedar 49-22, though didn't poll cell phones https://t.co/PYfJD7jWl8
Again, we HOPE Marist is on-target and Scott Walker is going down in flames. But we always caution that when a poll seems too good to be true, it probably is. This is no different https://t.co/WEcmkYE7cg
Last year, @DavidLJarman went into detail about what happened. It gives us good reason to be nervous about any poll that didn't weigh by education, especially after what happened in 2016 in ... Wisconsin https://t.co/WEcmkYE7cg
And as several have pointed out, Marist did not weigh by education. One of the big sources of 2016 polling disaster in Midwest was pollsters having too many college educated voters https://t.co/WEcmkYE7cg
Polling has been limited here, but no one else has found anything like a 13-point deficit for Walker. In May, Evers campaign released poll showing him up, but by only 4. Marquette in June gave Walker the 4-point lead https://t.co/WEcmkYE7cg

27% of precincts (plus many early votes) in, and Kemp's lead is now up to 68-32. Casey Cagle joining a long line of establishment GOP frontrunners who flamed out in primary #GAGOV

This did indeed happen to David Dewhurst in 2012 Texas Senate GOP primary. Led Ted Cruz 45-34 in round one, lost to him 57-43 in runoff. https://t.co/AaXPn2fA57
22% of precincts reporting plus many early votes, and Kemp now up 66-34. Cagle falling short of 39% he got in May; we're not sure the last time someone got a smaller % of the vote in a runoff than they got in primary
137,000 votes in (14% of precincts plus many early votes) and its Kemp 65-35.
104,000 votes counted in #GAGOV (about 1/6th of May total) and Kemp still is up 63-37. At this point, Cagle may just hope he breaks 39% he got in round one
85,000 votes in #GAGOV (5% of precincts plus many early votes) and its still Kemp 62-38.
Now up to 72,000 votes in #GAGOV and its still Kemp 63-37. Metro Atlanta may bring him down when it comes in, but this is looking like a bloodbath for once-frontrunner Cagle
Now 62,000 votes in #GAGOV (about 10% of total cast in May GOP primary), and Kemp up 62-38. So far, Cagle doing slightly worse than he did in May
52,000 votes counted in #GAGOV GOP runoff (total turnout in May for GOP was 607,000) and Kemp leads 61-39. Very little of metro Atlanta in so far
Getting first 2,000 votes from #GAGOV. Remember: Friends don't let friends over-examine very small pile of votes at the beginning of an election night.

AP calls #NY21 Dem primary for businesswoman Tedra Cobb. Will face tough race vs. Elise Stefanik in seat that went from 52-46 Obama to 54-40 Trump
AP calls #SC04 GOP primary for state Sen. William Timmons. Since it's apparently upside-down night, he somehow successfully argued his opponent was too extreme for GOP primary voters
There are election night surprises, and then there's this. https://t.co/cryD9A8DQk
#UT03 GOP Rep. John Curtis having no trouble. 60% in, winning rematch with Herrod 74-26

AP calls #NY25 Dem primary for Assembly Majority Leader Joseph Morelle, leading 43-21. Heavy favorite to succeed the late Louise Slaughter
AP calls #NY12 Dem primary for Carolyn Maloney, leading Suraj Patel 58-42. Hopefully, this is last we'll hear of Tinder Banking
No surprise, AP called Dem primary in safely blue #CO02 for Joe Neguse. On track to be Colorado's first black member of Congress, first Eritrean-American member from anywhere

21% in crowded #NY19 Dem primary to take on John Faso, and attorney Antonio Delgado up 29-17
62% in #NY01 Dem primary to face Lee Zeldin, and Perry Gershon leads Kate Browning 35-30. Gershon has lots of $, but his recent relocation from Manhattan could be a problem on eastern Long Island
In lead up to #NY14 primary, Joe Crowley outspent Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez $1.09 mil to $127,000. Just an amazing upset against incumbent who looked like he had all the advantages
Actually, Crowley spent $1.1 million. He was acting like he was worried when it didn't look like he was in real trouble https://t.co/U26fFqsrE6 https://t.co/0zQ8Cds9cp
Another NYC Dem is in real danger right now. With 88% in, Yvette Clarke up 50.5-49.5, a margin of about 250 votes #NY09

15% in #MDGOV Dem primary, and former NAACP head Ben Jealous leads Prince George's County Exec Rushern Baker 39-31
AP calls #CO01 Dem primary for longtime Rep. DeGette, taking 73% of vote. Unlike in NYC, a primary opponent trying to go after her from left didn't work so well
Dem establishment doing much better Upstate. 50% reporting in Dem primary to succeed late Louise Slaughter, and Assembly Majority Leader Joseph Morelle up 44-22 #NY25
One NYC Dem got by without much trouble. Eliot Engel taking 75% of vote against wealthy self-funder in safely blue #NY16
87% in #NY09 and it's gotten even tighter. Rep. Yvette Clarke leads Adem Bunkeddeko 50.6-49.4, margin of about 300 votes

The AP has called #NY11 GOP primary for Rep. Dan Donovan. Leads ex-Rep. Mike Grimm 64-36 with 92% in
The AP fixed what seems to have been an error in Lexington County, McMaster back to 54-46. https://t.co/4GlVmZvVOl
The AP has called #COGOV primary for state Treasurer and Bush cousin Walker Stapleton. Likely to face Rep. Jared Polis, who leads 43-26 with 69% in
This is odd: AP now has #SCGOV as just 52-48 McMaster. They called the race for him a few minutes ago.
AP calls safely red #MS03 for local DA Michael Guest. He's been mentioned as a GOP rising star for a while.
55% in #NY12 Dem primary, and Rep. Carolyn Maloney up 55.5-44.5 against Suraj Patel of Tinder banking infamy.
63% in #NY09 Dem primary, and Rep. Clarke leads just 52-48.

With 52% in, Rep. Yvette Clarke leads Adem Bunkeddeko 53-47 in safely blue #NY09. And surprisingly, this isn't nearly the worst showing for an NYC incumbent tonight.
Now at 51% reporting in #NY14 and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez up 58-42 over Rep. Crowley. You can't get more anti-establishment vs. establishment than this: 28-year-old Sanders organizer vs. Queens chair and possible future speaker.
AP has called #SCGOV for Trump-backed incumbent Henry McMaster. Favorite, but not sure thing, against Dem state Rep. and veteran James Smith
Whoa. With 31% in safely blue #NY14, Ocasio-Cortez leading longtime Rep. Joe Crowley 57-43. This would be a Cantor-sized upset over the chair of Queens machine
Now at 84% in #SCGOV and McMaster 54-46. Warren is narrowly ahead in Charleston, but nowhere else outside or very close to upstate
43% reporting in #NY11 GOP primary, and Rep. Dan Donovan leading ex-Rep. Mike Grimm 65-35. Trump endorsed Donovan over more Trumpish Grimm
62% reporting for Dems in swingy #CO06, and establishment fav Jason Crow up 68-32. Opponent Levi Tillemann made waves by secretly recording Hoyer and getting peppersprayed in face.
The #CO01 Dem primary is anticlimactic. 78% in and longtime Rep. Diana DeGette taking 72% against well-funded foe.
43% reporting in #COGOV Dem primary, and Polis leading Johnston 39-27, Kennedy also at 27. For GOP, Stapleton beating Mitchell 51-28. About what we'd expected if it holds up.
Markwayne Mullin seems to be feeling some pain for breaking term-limits pledge, but not quite enough to cost him #OK02 GOP primary. 22% in and leads 55.5-24.3; needs majority to avoid runoff
Polls are closed in Colorado and New York, and we're now at the mercy of the New York City Board of Elections

70% of #SCGOV GOP primary in, and McMaster up 56-44. Most of Warren's Greenville base out so this may narrow, but really tough to see him clawing his way back
About 40,000 votes counted in #OKGOV GOP primary (5% of election day precincts plus many early votes), and former OKC Mayor Mick Cornett first with 29. Lt. Gov. Todd Lamb leads rich guy Kevin Stitt 24.5-24.1 for 2nd spot in Aug runoff

50% of #SCGOV is in and McMaster up 57-43. Map remains the same: Warren's support in and just around upstate in northwest corner deep, but McMaster winning everywhere else
Because Maryland extended voting in three Baltimore precincts an hour, no results from state until 9 ET
35% in #SGOV and McMaster up 56-44. Warren still doing very well in northwest but winning nowhere else; hard to see him making up enough ground #SCGOV
22% reporting in #SC04 GOP primary, and William Timmons leading far-right Club for Growth backed Lee Bright 56-44. Seat safely red.
26% now reporting in #SCGOV GOP primary and McMaster up 54-46. Very little of Greenville, where Warren did well 2 weeks ago, in, but a lot of his other friendly northwestern counties are reporting
We're up to 20% reporting in #SCGOV GOP primary, and McMaster up 55-45. So far Warren is doing very well in northwest, McMaster ahead everywhere else

@CBC727 Something like this, you mean? https://t.co/QL9dI7Qg9a
In case anyone was wondering why we don't report results until about 10% of precincts are in: McMaster went from leading by 4 to trailing by 9, all thanks to a few extra precincts.
The polls closed less than half an hour ago &amp; we're still awaiting the first substantial results, so you know @PoliticsWolf has pivoted from voting rights &amp; redistricting Twitter into: https://t.co/JqCGitdhOg
@progressive_va Because it's a statewide poll. Asking about specific House candidates would require conducting multiple individual district-level polls
We have our first 77 votes out of #SCGOV. Remember: Friends don't let friends analyze 1 precinct's worth of returns
If you're awaiting #SCGOV and #SC04 results, get comfortable. Two weeks ago we didn't have 10% of precincts reporting statewide until 90 minutes after polls closed
