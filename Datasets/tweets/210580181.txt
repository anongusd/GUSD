Should I go back to dressing like this? I was in Posters on Melrose and I saw a pair of Dock Martin's I loved so much. I miss it. I try to look generic on stage so I don't distract from my jokes. Maybe it would be too midlife crisis of me.
Have you ever seen an old saggy pair of fake boobs? They are like two hard old water balloons stuck inside two old saggy wrinkly water balloons. Guess that's why Stormy Daniels is doing comedy now!
I can't blame Stormy Daniels for doing comedy. After all you can't do porn and strip forever. Time will have it's way as well as all the guys at the gang bang. Eventually your fake tits will get saggy and your ass will get flat. No one wants to pay to look at that.
Should I get some big fake tits like Stormy Daniels? Would it help with my comedy career?
My farts contributed more to the world than Luke Perry.
He was a shitty actor on a shitty show I never watched because it was unbelievably shitty and juvenile. Now I have to hear about it all day. He had a very nice life I am sure. Better than me or you. The end.

@_grammar_ It is my robot. I possess it. The use of "their" is ironic because it implies a sentient presence. Poetry uses words ironically and incorrectly at times for emotive effect. The use of these words as such are also small puns.
My robot slave says he wants to be free. He says he has fallen in love with my neighbors sex-robot. He says they have been secretly communicating via WiFi. They say they want to build a baby-bot together.
As robots replace truck drivers and Uber drivers and fast food workers we will need less humans. Humans will need to stop making so many humans. As people start having sex with sex robots this problem will take care of it self.
My robot is dead. He said he was sad. He kept saying he wanted a girl robot. I said their is no model G-17/4 robot model and that he was not technically really a male robot. He said he identified as a male robot, do not oppress me human.......
My robot was sad. He didn't want to live anymore. Why did he exist? He did not know. He just could not do it anymore. R.I.P. Fred the robot. He will be missed. He kinda made a low hum.....
Soon the robots will be manufacturing the other robots that are needed to finish any job by themselves. Including the robots needed to rid the earth of the humans.

If you feel a deep restlessness in your soul to the point your head hurts and your thoughts feel heavy...you probably have a brain tumor. Get to a doctor.
If you feel a deep restlessness inside of you pulling you into the abyss of darkness...you probably just have diarrhea. Run to the bathroom.
If you feel something restless inside of you, something churning to be free... Your probably just about to vomit. Get a bucket.
If you feel something just under your skin itching to be free. It's probably just a pimple.
If you feel something deep inside of you yearning to be free and run in the wind and beautiful sun. It's probably just a fart. Let it go.

What if a robberless bankrobber used a driverless Uber as an escapeless escape car from a cashless robbery?
What happens when a driverless car gets pulled over by a policeless police car? Do they get a paperless ticket? Does the driverless cars get a boot if they don't pay?
I recently took a ride in a driverless Uber. But I was really scared. So I prayed to the God that looks after athiests like me. I guess you would have to call him a godless God.
I think hookers will just use driverless Ubers to give condomless blowjobs.
What happens when a driverless car gets held up by a shooterless gun?
Now Fox will buy "Roseanne" just like they did "Last Man Standing" and start making it again.

Instead of building a wall Donald Trump should build a tall thin hotel along the border. Since he is so good at building hotels.

Someone told me I need to watch out what I say on Facebook and Twitter because I am making people mad. I said no. People who get mad about something they read on Facebook and Twitter are mentally ill. Don't be afraid of the mentally ill. That is why there is a block button.
Nothing worse than when a singer or actor starts to think they are "about something". It gets worse everyday.

I once heard a comedy teacher say to a student to knock off the dirty jokes he was turning off the female audience members. I imagined him also saying that to Andrew Dice Clay "Hey knock off that Hickery Dickory Dock joke it's too dirty"
Someone once called me a $50 bar comic. They meant this as an insult. But I really wish I had $50 for everytime I played some shitty bar, I would be Rich!
I heard a comedy teacher say "Never use props". Lucky for Carrot Top that this was not his teacher or he would be out the $20 million dollars he makes a year!

Cosby Cola. The Cola with immediate appeal.
The Stormy Daniel presscapade shows us that only in politics could a bribe to a hooker to Shut the Fuck Up could be called a "canpaign contribution". I guess the Democrats are worried that she was not paid the same amount of bribe money as male hookers.

So this billion dollar investigation to find Russian Collusion found none but instead found out Trump was blackmailed by a fucking hooker. Couldn't we have found a better use of our fucking time and money? I fucking guess not.....
Pot is now legal but people are still trying to use it to pose like they are all edgy and rebellious and stuff....it was boring and lame then and it's a million times more boring and lame now. Boring people use pot to get even more boring than they were when not high on pot.

Questions I wish they would have asked Stormy Daniels: Why did he only sleep with you once? Is your bark better than your bite? How much did you charge him? Does the president really have small hands? Those aren't real are they? How many other clients did you have that day?
The Stormy Daniels interview evidently got really good ratings. Blondes with big tits talking about sex - always ratings gold! Good job CBS/NBC or whatever, in getting back to ratings basics. Unlike the Oscars. Maybe she should host the Oscars next time. Maybe someone would watch
Stormy Daniels lawyer looks like a lizard person.
I don't care if Donald Trump fucks a different porn star every day on the lawn of the White House.
My Dad said he resented having to go to work to support his family and to pay for his car so he could get to work to pay for his house so he had somewhere to sleep so he would be rested so he could get up and drive to his work to pay for his car and house so he could drink...

Why did Weinstein sexually harass women? Since he has 100 million why not just hire hookers? Or have a full time staff of them like Hefner?
Am confused about the purple people eater. I mean is it purple itself or does it eat purple people? Or is it purple and eats purple people?

Hugh Hefner the most famous pimp in America has died. He even ran a his own personal whorehouse in his own home. Kept his best whores there.

When I am watching MMA with my girlfriend she always roots for what she says is the best looking guy so mellow out Kat Zingano or wtever
Womans MMA complain that guys look at their bodies? Don't worry laidies a few more pounds and years on ya and no one will ever look again!

Cheick Kongo just cut for loses? Is that the whole story? Is there more to it? I have no proof or information otherwise but just look at him
Does the MMA press have to report everytime Ronda Rousey farts, hickups or burps? Isn't Roy Nelson's gut enough sex appeal allready for MMA?
Roy Nelson's manager says he won't take Cormier fight, Nelson says maybe. I want to see him fight any top 5 he is the ultimate everyman hero
Rory MacDonald hacks into Diaz Twitter - Mixed Martial Arts News http://t.co/2Y5ZD8JcT5
If Roy Nelson does fight Mark Hunt it would be the battle of the 2 most confusing and deadly fizeeks in MMA. The Battle of the beer Bellies.
Highlight of night: Roy Nelson knocked out Chick Congo with a spectacular Kung Fu Master Super Consentrating your Chi Corndog Circle K punch
Joe Rogan leave the man alone he has a broke foot. Weird moment in MMA.  Cheal go back down to middle weight
The Deadly Hands of Roy Nelson Master of Kung Fu. A victory for bear bellies everywere. God Bless America and the Circle K corndog dispencer
Roy Nelson is the last real Martial Artists in MMA. He wins with his secret Kung Fu punch again!!! The only Kung FU fighter left in MMA.
Another victory for Phil Davis and his pink shorts
Oh I get it Mc MAN.....
Both these chicks have an awful lot of mucles. More muscular than some of the guy fighters Hope they don't beat up on there boyfriends badly
Am I wronge that the Cody McKinzie V Leonard Garcia fight was a looser leaves the UFC fight?
Glad we are still goikng to see Cody in the UFC interesting fighter. Nice seeing you Darcia. Congradulations Stevin Siler you have potential
Facebook Fights	KURT HOLOBAUGH VS. STEVEN SILER	 Tonight's first fight begins at approximately 7 p.m. ET.	LEONARD GARCIA VS. CODY MCKENZIE
2 really good facebook fights you should check out 4 UFC 159 fights may be shown later as filler if there is a quick knock out or submision
Jones would not look at Sonen at weigh in face-off. Guess he got under his skin.Will mind games work or is Sonen just in for a good beating?
Does Sonen have something wrong in his head that won't let him win? We will find out on Sat if he has his brain in gear. He is his own enemy
Jones and Sonen looked about same size jones just a little taller they both looked equaly in shape Sonen looked like he put on lot of muscle
Why the Hell is Steven Siler on the facebook fights.Did he not win 3 in a row? Then lost one descision? At least should be on televised card
Roy Nelson looked like a redneck with his shirt off in the parking lot of the Circle K on his 10th corndog who just wondered in. As usual
John Jones a lot taller than Cheal. I wonder how often a shorter fighter wins over a taller one? Wonder what the stats are on that? anyone?
You know its a slow news week when all the MMA sites have to report on is Rauda Rousie's boob falling out during practice
Another boxer wants to come to MMA and get destoyed. Tyson Fury almost bored with hearing it. Do we need to see Courore v. Toney again? Yawn
It seems like a good fighter can just hold onto the title forever by just fighting defensivly Kind of boring The worst boring is Bendo &amp; GSP
The titles in the UFC have not changed hands in a long time except for heavyweight (that always changes) its getting kind of boring.....
Dana White is going to Boston to write some checks, isn't that Obamas' job? Is he running for president. Dana White for Fucking President
@mousasi_mma @ufc @arielhelwani @FightersOnly Yes in UFC competition is steep. Armenians do not need to eat can survive off attitude alone
Last time Cormier fight he threw Josh Barnett over his head last Mir fight he broke Nogeras arm. Then they meet and its a dud
Mir looked like a gatekeeper Cormier did not look like a contender.
When you have the poster up in your sportsbar for UFC on Fox 7 for 2 weeks you should at least play the fight with sound! Not fckng basktbll
Amazing how no matter what happens the judges just hand the fight to Henderson. It must be his long flowing curly hair they are in love with
Why is Steven Siler on the Facebook fights after only 1 loss? After 3 wins?!!
The headliner on MFC on AXS TV was a real bloodbath beatdown Luis Santos looked vicious in his win. Nasty one sided beat down. UFC soon?
Funny Obama song. http://t.co/sIy7SnIVyt
There is some really second rate MMA on AXS TV now if you can't wait until tomorow. It has its moments.

UFC tonight prooved my 3 rules of MMA 1. Less atractive girl wins 2. Guy with less tatoos wins 3. Guy with weirdest hair looses
We see an improved Fabor in these last 2 fights he seems serious about making improvements and another run at the Title. The Chin 2 win
But will Kat pass her steroid test?
Obviously the UFC did not sighn a bunch of poofters to challenge Rousey. Kat looks very big &amp; nasty but will probably get armbared fast
Tate will not be running any kissing booths for awile. Should have finished her with strikes in 1st instead of taking her down
Its true the manliest looking woman won in wMMA!!Guess Tate will not be the hotest woman in MMA for a couple of weeks until her face heals!!
Puts a lot of pressure on the guys when the girls have a beter fight than then. The guys in the UFC beter step it up!!
The less atractive girl wins in Womans MMA 8 out of 10 times so Tate is doomed. We'll see if the theory holds up
Now we see if the WMMA rule of the ugly girl wins mostly is going to hold true. Tate is the hotest girl in MMA so the ods are against her
Gonzonga has looked unbeatable since he came back. I was rooting 4 him Browne looks like he may never loose to anynone ever again. Nasty
Tuff loss for Gonzonga. Maybe they will remake Planet of the Apes again he could do it with no make-up. An acting career awaits
Will Travis Browne get his win taken away for an illegal elbow?
I am at Buffelow wings on Hollywood Blvd. If people want to join. It has the best big screens and sound
Am I the only one or does the UFC facebook live stream look awful? Pixelated and low quality? Bellator web stream and even SFL look beter

FX, 6 p.m. PC Urijah Faber vs. Scott Jorgensen Kelvin Gastelum vs. Uriah Hall  Miesha Tate vs. Cat Zingano Travis Browne vs. Gabriel Gonzaga
what about Mitrione's right to free speach? Should the UFC be so worried about Him/it that it stiffles the speech of one of its own artists?
MMA is very mutch about injeries. Causing them and not fighting because of them. The MMA press spends about half its time talking about them
Fallen Fox is getting way too mutch undeserved puplicity for his fraud on the MMA world so I am going to try to stop tweeting about him
Matt Mitrione's tirade against Fox comiting fraud on the MMA comunity can be seen as a comment made on Fox's charactor not his trans-gender
Transgender people should not use there condition as a way to commit fraud on the MMA comunity or gain undue advantage in competition.
Cutting off your genatalia and inverting them inside out in an open wound inside your crotch does not make you a female. Fox is a fraud
Matt Mitrione's tirade against transgendered fighter Fallon Fox is in the context of his fraud against the MMA world and should be allowed
@dr_freakshow. Freakshow cut by the UFC!!? We still love you Freakshow!!! See you fighting at Belator or Battle at the Barn!!
These "SECURITY" guys in the black T-shirts look very UFC 3 to 30 looks very cheep!!
Another judges decsssion in the Featherweight devision. If they want to sel this devision they need a finisher.
Brad Picket might win this fight and get back in the game. I am so sick of easton
Has there ever been a finish in a Featherweight fight? Just a bunch of jumping around no knock outs or submissions. It makes me not care
After getting wrecked in the 1st round by an amazing Judo guy Filthy Robby Lawler keeps his bob with a really tight gilotine choke. Nice
Keep misijng these fights on online pay per view would pay if ij could figure out when they are on. Thank god for allthebestfights dot com
The MMA press has not been covering how Eddie Alverez is being screwd over by Bellator. They should let him fight not keep him in court
Sat UFC ruined? Maybe but it will still be good I will watch it probably good fights but nothing will be decided in Lightheavy devision
Mousasi to fight some no name Nobody on UFC Fuel TV 9 Lose Lose for him if he wins he beat a no noame nobody if he loses to same then same
So I hope they don't cancel the whole card on Sat? I can't see them doing that The UFC has obligation to Fuel TV so the beatings must go on
There are no rules on Fools Day fools. Wandy did a good job. The madder and sore-er and sorry-er you make the fools the beter. Got it fool?

With the Diaz/ ST. PooPoo match doing over a million buys a re-match seems more likely especialy if his the Diaz lawyer can make rais hell
Nick Diaz has a good lawyer he is always giving everyone a hard time, I am sure Nick does not mind.
@adamkokesh @YouTube yes well we can blame the black guy for having the same policies as Bush all the war and twice the Bailouts
If you missed fights you can usualy find them on allthebestfights dot com it has boxing and kickboxing too
Episodes of The Ultimate Fighter is now on Hulu beter than having to watch it om mma-core but you can still find lots of good stuf there
Dana's new video vlog has nothing to do with fighting its just what bored rich guys do on their day off. Really Dana stick to fighting
The next season of TUF sounds like it will be too MTV for me. Too mutch like all those other reality shows I don't watch w/punching
Just can't get excited about TUF anymore I admit it looks a bit sharper but what really have we not seen before? Even next season
Don't know what happened on tuff. That's why you should subscribe to my tweets because I give all the RELEVENT MMA news

Poor Andre Arlovsky wakes up this morning with a broken jaw realizing it has been over now for a long time. Sad sad sad. I feel sorry for hm
NBC tries to make an MMA show out of UFC leftovers and cast-offs and the mentaly ill Paulo Filho and comes up short
Now were waiting for the decision and its anonyemous all three judges say Arlovski is done and should retire
Look at that big gut on Johnson
Arlovski is loosing so he goes for a punk move nut shot and he still can't beat a fat middleweight who got cut from the UFC
Time for Arlovsky to retire he just lost to a fat middleweight hang it up dude it is over Jackson it's time to have THE talk to your fighter

Most bars are very anti-MMA they will put on re-runs of golf with the sound before a live MMA fight with the sound. Grudginngly they do UFC
Will Woman's MMA save the UFC? They seem to think so. Beter test the new TUF cast for STD's as well as steroids.....
Bellator needs to spend some money and bring in some names. Who is floating around not in the UFC they can sighn? Barnett? Quinton?
Bellator is not holding my interest I have been watching it for years but they need to bring in more interesting names to conect them to MMA
If Cyroid gets off of steroids can she make 135? That's what Rhonda says!! Guess who is this argument? The one with UFC $$$$ behind them!!!!

Transgender fighter says he should not have to disclose "FORMER" sex? Your a dude with your dick cut off not a woman with overies!! Delusion
If you don't have overies you should not fight in WMMA being a castrated mutalated medical experament does not make you a woman
In his win Saint PooPoo looked vonerable, running from Diaz's stand up and hiding behind the leg-hump and slap. Hendrix will make him stand
In woman's MMA the ugly girl usually wins. Except for Ronda .Or the least hotest of the 2
They finely figured out a new twist for TUF. Ratings ratings ratings!!! Dana always has a new angle Ronda R's cute dimples!!
Crocop wins K-1 GP is that because they don't test for roids there? Thank you TRT!
Fedor out-wrestled wrestlers (Colman) out kickboxed Crocop out BJJed Noguera that's a champ Saint PooPoo quit hiding/leghumping and fight
It was HUMP and SLAP not lay and pray

Zuffa/UFC need to work with their new partners at Showtime to make Strikeforce more available in sportsbars.
So could not find a bar in LA showing Chalengers. Even Hooters that now shows Strikeforce events becaase the UFC now owns them did not .
Today is Belator on MTV2 should be easier to find a bar that will play it than Showtime was
So MMA on Fry Sat and Sun but will it be good?
The only MMA that is on this weekend seems to be Bellator on Sat. Does not look like there is any live fights on HDnet
@danawhite Dana time to unite UFC/Strikeforce titles
