(3) We put in place regulations that keep Americans healthy and safe while promoting economic growth and innovation.
(2) We built a Federal Government that more effectively delivers the services that Americans rely on.
(1) We worked with Congress to pass economic and budget proposals that created jobs and opportunity, and protected our national security.
