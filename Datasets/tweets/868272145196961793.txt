@patdyo @saltyconchy @BillOReilly Thank you for informing me on Disney’s purchase of Fox.
@patdyo @saltyconchy @BillOReilly My original comment was simply stating that the article by @BillOReilly was talking about one sided media coverage, but the article itself was only talking about one side, therefore making Bill, a contributory to the problem he was attempting to shine a light on.
@patdyo @saltyconchy @BillOReilly Regardless, I respect your views and hope you can do the same In return.
@patdyo @saltyconchy @BillOReilly Whatsmore, by constantly attacking me rather than simply having a conversation with someone who doesn’t s hold the same  views as you demestrates  Fox News’s style of reporting, which is the exact reason why they are the joke of the news outlets.
@patdyo @saltyconchy @BillOReilly So we’re clear, when something is objective it means that it is universally true. When you say “I’m objective, and  Fox News shares my beliefs so therefore they are objective” your simple stating your own subjective view, making Fox News subject also.
@patdyo @BillOReilly Why do you think that Fox News is more objective than other news outlets? what makes you have this opinion?
@BillOReilly I can’t believe you have the audacity to post about media coverage and forget to mention the flagship of biased news, Fox News , which btw is also owned by the gigantic Disney Corp. if you’re gonna speak on media coverage not coving the full story, at least do it yourself Bill.

@amyalsalek @KeikoSledge we must create a truth table in order test such a bold statement.
@KeikoSledge @amyalsalek It may be logical, but is it sound?
Trump is willing to shutdown the gov in order to protect the American people from “immigrants”, while doing everything he can to weaken the affordable care act. If you really wanna protect the American people,protect them from the real threat, big insurance @realDonaldTrump @GOP

@WtfisPoshy I had a similar issue. Where only my upload was at 1.6 In order to find out if it was the isp for my pc I connected my lap top to the Ethernet cable. The lap top didn’t have the same problem. So I found out it was some program on my pc that was causing it issue.
