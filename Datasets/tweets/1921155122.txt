@cblatner94 @BleacherNation It's fine. He is under team control for 3 more years. He can go to arbitration each year if he wants. His numbers from last season wouldn't fare all that well in an arbitration case. The Cubs have been very good to him giving him raises when they didn't have to.
@BleacherNation @cblatner94 Maybe he'd rather switch places with Bryce Harper.

Also, he's not being greedy. He's looking out for his best interest. The Cubs did the same for the organization . https://t.co/cO411XLJmV
What's in it for him is free agency one year earlier. Which means (likely) a huge contract sooner. https://t.co/cO411XLJmV
