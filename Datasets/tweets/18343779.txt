@samsungAU @samsungmobile @ACurrentAffair9 @7newssydney @9NewsSyd @10NewsFirstSyd @theprojecttv consumers need to be aware that they are basically buying devices that can't be used for extended periods and as per Samsung "Screen burn is not normally covered under warranty"
@samsungAU @samsungmobile @ACurrentAffair9 @7newssydney @9NewsSyd @10NewsFirstSyd @theprojecttv please get in touch regarding the overpriced paperweights (Called phones by Samsung) - can't use for running apps (Google Maps, Youtube) for very long or screen burn occurs
@samsungAU weak response "Screen burn is not normally covered under warranty" is appalling. Basically your Galaxy S8 and I presume S9 are glorified, expensive PAPERWEIGHTS. Technicians informed me that you can't use GPS, Youtube, basically any application for long periods of time
@SamsungAU sent you my contact number, happy to give reference number when you call
Hey @SamsungMobile @SamsungAU extremely disapppointed the way the Galaxy S8 SCREEN BURN issue, OVERHEATING ISSUES and my concern that the S8 could potentially explode has been handled by your team. @7NewsSydney @9NewsSyd @10NewsFirstSyd can send you the video footage

@maccas today 10th July 2018 using the name as per my account here on Twitter. Called at 1.20pm and 2.25pm which you could have discovered if you called YOUR OWN TEAM who handle complaints. Is this how a large corporation like yours does business?
@theprojecttv @7newssydney @TenNewsSydney @ACurrentAffair9 @Channel9 want to hear about @maccas discrimination and disregard for customers? Get in touch I have a story for you
@maccas care more about their bottom line and profits rather than their  dine in customers. I will never dine @maccas West Ryde again. Change the  name of your meal to Unhappy Meal
@maccas care more about their bottom line and profits rather than their dine in customers. I will never dine @maccas West Ryde again. Change the name of your meal to Unhappy Meal
@maccas - some lessons for you. 1) don't treat your customers like idiots. 2) don't pass the buck &amp; take responsibility  3) find out how to keep your customers happy before they post on social media 4) know what is happening in your restaurants
I informed @maccas twice that they still didn't ask me what would make the situation better for me and only cared about themselves. @7NewsSydney @TenNewsSydney @channel9 want story of discrimination get in touch
Called @maccas head office twice. They informed me West Ryde store would handle complaint. So basically passed the buck to the store. Restaurant manager called and gave me the same song and dance
@maccas restaurant manager asked if problem was resolved. I said nothing had been one and the owner needs to know how incompetent manager is. I informed him @maccas Head Office would be informed
another @maccas manager tried to apologize but damage had already been done. @maccas shows they care about our money more than their customers who dine in their store
I asked for the @maccas owner to speak to me, John proceeded to walk off. Is that how @maccas care about their customers?
when I asked to speak to @maccas Manager he said he was the manager. John is his name. I said they should put a sign outside saying "@maccas don't care about you sitting in out restaurant, we just want your money, drive thru customers take priority"
asked @Maccas server when he brought toastie why the cappuccino still hadn't come, his words were "Drive thru customers get priority"
took my son to @Maccas West Ryde. He wanted a Happy Meal, I ordered a Cheese Toastie &amp;Cappuccino - one of the worst customer experiences ever. The order took long to arrive, The server burnt first cheese toastie, threw it in the bin, while my sons meal got cold on the counter

@theagebreaking and Masakadza is an authority on elephant numbers? Why not get a real wildlife authority and do real journalism?
@DavidLeyonhjelm @glennmcgrath11 what a moronic response David, produce some hard facts first
@DavidLeyonhjelm what a disgrace. You believe that its legal to shoot elephants in one of the most corrupt countries in the world?
wouldn't $30,000-$50,000 be useful for @mcgrathfdn instead Glenn Mcgrath @glennmcgrath11 slaughtered elephant for trophy hunt?
Greyhound Racing Victoria chairman quits http://t.co/lsev7X2fTm - any announcement coming from @McGrathFdn soon?
@CAComms Cricket Australia, never thought I'd be dealing with crap from you. Abandoned match&amp;jump through hoops to get refund.#cricketfail
@Gunsinaustralia as a proud ex South African and also a very proud Australian, I am disgusted. Culling elephants humanely vs trophy hunting.
@Gunsinaustralia shooting an elephant is wrong. I don't need to read what you write. No mater whether its legal or not. Period
@hardyswine @glennmcgrath11 Glenn Mcgrath last time I checked regret is not apology. Rethink sponsorship @hardyswine - spin doctors at work
@hardyswine @glennmcgrath11 Hardys - will you be running ads on how good your wine tastes with slaughtered elephant or venison?
@BrettLee_58 curious how it felt holding that slaughtered animal? was that the trip the elephant was slaughtered by @glennmcgrath11?
can anyone confirm the "legality" that shooting a defenseless elephant in Zimbabwe was licensed and legal. @glennmcgrath11 @TheTodayShow
@TheTodayShow @glennmcgrath11 TodayShow - not on Glenn Mcgrath payroll are you? It's never ok to shoot an elephant. will avoid your show
RT @HumanHeadline: Hinch on the Glenn McGrath Safari - Video Link - http://t.co/3foo9HaPki	#hinchtube #glennmcgrath
@TheTodayShow regret over killing elephant does not excuse. Glenn Mcgrath regrets 6 years later AFTER photos appear.your segment was a joke
@sunriseon7 Glenn Mcgrath sorry 6 years after he photos emerged of him killing elephant. He's got a big grin in photo, no regrets there
@sunriseon7 an absolute disgrace. hope @glennmcgrath11 sponsors pull sponsorships. I won't be supporting any causes affiliated with him
@Auckland_NZ rethink new tourism campaign with Glenn Mcgrath @glennmcgrath11 - better hope you don't have elephants or endangered animals
glenn mcgrath @glennmcgrath11 deeply regrets.didn't notice him deeply regretting it in the last 6 years since. He regrets the photos now
@paulmp http://t.co/XQjMJ6X7Fd @glennmcgrath11 elephants ..fell to 4,000 last year from 13,000 in 2001- sound "licensed and legal" now?
@paulmp @glennmcgrath11 the full story is Glenn Mcgrath shot and killed an elephant for sport. No other explanation. Let the fallout begin
@paulmp I call it as I see it, I don't do it to make people listen. Slaughtering a defenseless animal deserves the punishment that is coming
@paulmp @CricketAus @glennmcgrath11 nothing to do with vegan, cruelty to innocent, especially almost extinct animals, I will speak up
so if greyhound blooding resulted in Greyhound Australia board quitting, @glennmcgrath11 Glenn Mcgrath - sponsors walk now
@paulmp @CricketAus @glennmcgrath11 when there are animals nearing extinction and he kills a helpless animal its #murder in my books
@CricketAus put #murderer Glenn Mcgrath @glennmcgrath11 on at your own risk. Sponsors walk away immediately
@McGrathFdn cut ties with Glenn Mcgrath @glennmcgrath11 #murderer immediately or close your doors.Better deserving cancer research charities
glenn mcgrath @glennmcgrath11 will never support any TV network, cause or activity you are involved in. killing an elephant is #murder
@glennmcgrath11 I had respect for you as cricketing legend. Killing an innocent elephant - you are a fucking disgusting human being
@CAComms took my son for his first game, you abandoned match. Almost 4 weeks delay and only 50% refund offered. I won't attend another match

@CAComms interested to know how the match 26th Jan 2015 between Aus&amp;India which was abandoned (16 overs, 61 minutes) gets a 50% refund?

@auspost Nathan you should do your job, wouldn't have taken you long to see that I posted reference number on Aug 14.
@auspost Nathan there's bigger issue than worrying about spelling. Just again shows you have not even looked at the trail of messages so far
@auspost just proves incompetence &amp; not taking my issue seriously. Is privacy something @auspost care about? Authorities need to know
@auspost when you can't deliver my mail properly after me reporting issue TWICE, &amp; then send me a cut/paste email with suburb spelled wrong
@auspost can't deliver mail properly, can't spell their OWN delivery centre name, how does that restore faith in you? http://t.co/KP1Ci4sn3V
@dailytelegraph interested in how @auspost completely disregard the privacy and security of customer mail more than TWICE? Drop me a line
@smh you want a story about how @auspost is failing to actually put mail INSIDE the mailbox? Happy to share this story if you interested
@auspost get your staff to do their damn job - that's what they getting paid for! mail goes INSIDE the mailbox
@auspost and please stop your nonsense!don't appreciate cut&amp;paste email that if the mail continues to be delivered incorrectly to contact u?
@auspost maybe we should all deliver our own mail - if you going to outsource email support overseas, you may want to train staff! hopeless!
@auspost is this a joke?received email from you &amp;Stefanie can't spell YOUR delivery centre suburb name? Its Taren Point NOT Tarin Point!!
@auspost while I appreciate the sentiment, should have been resolved last year. I am sending a formal complaint and alerting news networks
@auspost locked mailbox. all that needs to be done is put mail IN THE BOX. Complete disregard of privacy. Mail has been stolen previously

@auspost VH2886745 is complaint from today. i dont have reference number for other complaint from 6th February 2014.
@auspost will be sending a formal complaint about the gross breach of privacy - why was this not handled in the first place since feb 2014?

@VodafoneAU_Help unbelievable! Manager from collections called after I complained and he said sorry. Why waste my time? #VodaFAIL
@VodafoneAU_Help I've emailed detailing my experience. It didn't have to come to this if Support handled this in the first place
@VodafoneAU_Help spent 1 hour yest and 1 hour today. multiple people,who keep passing me around. @VodafoneAU should have handled this better
@VodafoneAU_Help review your processes. when you tell me to make payment on 23/6 and my phone number is still not active on 17th Jul
@VodafoneAU_Help maybe check the call logs with your customer service since June 23rd or give me a call. OH WAIT - its still not active

@Optus as a customer for more than 10 years, I am disgusted with how you have treated me as a customer. So many excuses.
@Optus I've given plenty of chances to resolve this. You are leaving me no choice
@Optus it wouldn't have come to this if someone did their job in the first place.
@Optus can't tell me someone is looking into this. I've made multiple calls from 28th April. I've got txt messages from @Optus 2 modems sent
@optus @ACurrentAffair9 want to call me regarding Optus excuses for delay in phone and internet reconnection? been a month
@Optus maybe @Channel7 should know about how its taking 1 month to reconnect phone &amp; internet line and the multiple excuses?
@Optus I told Ron I would be going to social media for answers. Expecting a call from Optus TODAY.
@Optus  I've documented everything and I'm sure others are affected too. Channel 9 @channel9 may want to call me and other networks too
@Optus expecting response from someone senior today. Not playing around. I had this cancelled on the 28th of April.
@theprojecttv you guys want a story about @Optus messing me around for a phone/internet reconnection - you should hear the excuses

@Agedparent agreed. Best judge of that would be vet when I speak tomorrow.
@PhoneTrips rough estimate I guess, I'm not sure until I get the call from vet
@codem only if more people thought like you!
@maurine1105 the gesture is enough. Hope you are well
@jimhillhouse awesome gesture-thank you! power of the Internet, I'll keep you posted.
@whudmel1 thats fantastic but would you do it for someone else's dog if owner said no - thats a different situation...
without surgery, dog does not survive. Cost is around $500 - What would you do? I know what I will do....
found out dog is ok overall...but with dislocated hip.Needs surgery.Now owner has to make the call,lets hope its the right one!
@CoachDeb Hey Deb great to hear from you - hope all is well. Not sure about cruise - so much happening, but will definitely try for sure
@TheMorganizer Hey Mike nice to hear from you. Don't even own a pet but now maybe I will :) Lets touch base soon!
@Labeaux vet got in touch with owners only today.Not sure decision they will take but I'd take him (my wife and son are in for surprise!)
thanks everyone for replies.Dog is bright eyed at moment.Looks like concern is his leg and internals- waiting on xrays. Will keep you posted
@121314 please this is not about me. I just hope more people would do what a few of us did to make sure this dog had best chance!
@herdvillanueva its not about me.just hope we can all do our bit to help any living thing.
@tkells I'm hoping it does! Many factors as depends on dogs injuries, owner's decision on medical requirements etc
no vets to pick dog up, council only pick up dead animals and RSPCA was 1 hour away. What type of world do we live in?
@amandanetwork thank you. no vets to pick injured dog up, too heavy and in pain to pick up into car..council only pick up dead animals....
@kimcoach I think thats great. I'm appalled though by lack of responsibility as an Australian nation though. These animals have lives too
@purplelyna didn't get chance to take photo.Wanted to make sure he was fine. Shout outs to some good passersby Celeste and Deanne who helped

@philippmuller lets do it! can transform lives
@Mgkchild how about some random Twitter kindness? Would that make someone smile - I think it would!
@Freed2Travel possibly I think people in this day& age just trying 2 keep head above water- worry about others after - you know what I mean?
@dingo1952 great message I'm sure it puts a smile on someone's face when people do random acts of kindness
