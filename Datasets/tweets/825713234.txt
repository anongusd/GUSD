2) By all means, hold all candidates to an exacting standard on the issues you care about. Plenty of places where Sanders's program could be stronger/more ambitious. But the idea that he has less to offer on race/gender justice than Harris/Biden/Beto is simply false.
There are plenty of good-faith arguments one can make against Bernie Sanders's nomination. Propagating the notion that he is distinctly uninterested in (/hostile to) issues of race and gender justice is dishonest and unnecessary. https://t.co/TCiox4ZBG4

@davidcrespo @MattBruenig @armandodkos @nathansnewman There are def some upsides. Media attention is another, imo. "Socialism is back" makes for sexier copy than "some on the American left are demanding a Western European-style welfare state again." For this and other reasons, DSA punches way above its weight in the discourse.
@MattBruenig @armandodkos @nathansnewman esops strike me as weak tea. But I do describe Bernie as a socialist because of his self-id (and personal involvement in socialist movements).

@armandodkos @nathansnewman There are a lot of reasonable answers to this. My own tentative view though is that -- since no one in national politics is actually calling for socializing finance -- we shouldn't be calling any of them socialists. https://t.co/fHBUMUXlnX
@armandodkos @nathansnewman (For insight into what "social ownership of finance" might mean, see: https://t.co/cvvD3XshQp	https://t.co/S2eowySIQk)
@armandodkos @nathansnewman 3) All those things seem comptaible with (far) left-liberalism/social democracy except for the last. So I think in many contemporary contexts, "socialist" is most comprehensible as an expression of commitment to social ownership of finance.
@armandodkos @nathansnewman 2) That vision entails: Wide range of decommodified sectors (like health-care, housing, education, transit, etc...) + autonomous firms (whose internal management structures are democratic) competing in heavily regulated markets for most consumer goods + socialized capital market.

The power of irresponsible media is an abiding problem in democratic theory, one that troubled no less of a liberal than Lippmann.
@jonathanchait @SeanMcElwee I agree that Sean frames this in a provocative and facially illiberal way. But was the Fairness Doctrine authoritarian?

@jonathanchait @EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN Yeah. If I had to guess I would say that that is most likely. Regardless, the remark was at best irresponsible.
@benshapiro @RubensteinAdam @jonathanchait @EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN I don't doubt that your position is rooted in values. But the upshot of those values is that it is evil for US Jews not to support Israel's existence, and they should thus use their political voice in the U.S. to safeguard Israel's interests. (Which is legitimate.)
@joshtpm @jonathanchait @EricKleefeld @elivalley @IlhanMN What I am not saying: It is fine and good to say American Jews who support Israel "have allegiance to a foreign power."		What I am saying: Many rightwing Jews including Shapiro do objectively insist that American Jews must have allegiance to the state of Israel, a foreign power.
@jonathanchait @EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN Given the context for the remark -- her expressing frustration at the fact that her criticisms of Israel get derailed by her saying the wrong thing -- it seems somewhat unlikely that she would then *self-consciously* invoke an anti-Semitic trope.
@jonathanchait @EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN Of course. I'm not saying she wasn't talking about Israel. I'm saying she might have used the language of "foreign allegiance" because it has been so prevalent in the discourse due to Russiagate, rather than because it has been a common anti-Semitic trope.
@j_furm @jonathanchait @EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN Fair. If I could edit the tweet, I'd replace with "some"
@jonathanchait @EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN But it seems possible to me that she intended to invoke Russiagate, not that trope.
@jonathanchait @EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN ...she was trying to frame her concerns about the Israel lobby around what appeared to her as an uncontroversial consensus view in our politics (that foreign interference is a major concern). I'm not saying this analogy makes sense, or her words weren't unwise...
@jonathanchait @EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN Yeah. I think that's plausibly (perhaps probably) right. But it seems possible to me that -- after 2+ years of foreign (i.e. Russian) influence over the US government being a top national news story...
@jonathanchait @EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN I never said that she did.
@jonathanchait @EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN But it does not follow from any of that that Ben Shapiro *doesn't* argue that Jews should feel a dual allegiance to both the US and Israel -- which he *very very* plainly does!
@jonathanchait @EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN I think it is dangerous to imply that American Jews's *primary* allegiance is to "a foreign power." And Omar's remarks lend themselves to that interpretation, which is bad. (I have not examined this controversy yet, just RTed Kleefield's observation).

@jonathanchait @EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN Rightwing nationalists believe a person can only be loyal to a single country or people, because they see the world in zero-sum, tribalist terms. I don't.
@jonathanchait @EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN I don't understand why you think I'm saying that is not possible. Shapiro believes Jews should feel total allegiance to both the United States and Israel, as many many other American Jews also do (many of whom have dual citizenship, which is a normal, legitimate thing).
@jonathanchait @EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN The values he supports includes allegiance to a foreign power. Which is totally fine to me, in the abstract. I'm not an American nationalist. The problem is the foreign power in question maintains de facto (and increasingly de jure) apartheid rule in areas it controls.
@jonathanchait @EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN Maybe I don't understand the meaning of the phrase dual loyalty. But Shapiro definitely argues that American Jews should feel a form of loyalty to the Israeli government. I don't think that's remotely ambiguous.
@jonathanchait @EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN Why does it have to be?
@jonathanchait @EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN He doesn't believe that there is any conflict between Israel and the US's interests, so he's not arguing for allegiance "at the expense of." But I'm pretty certain that he is arguing an anti-Zionist cannot be a good Jew.

@DrMaryHicks 2. Anti-blackness is one of this nation's founding ideologies. Through centuries of struggle, African-Americans and allied movement shave eroded it substantially. But it remains a powerful force in our politics.
@DrMaryHicks I think there are a couple of differences:		1) The size of the injury to the black population is exponentially larger; the theft is centuries-long, and trillions of dollars wide. There are also way more African Americans in this country than Jews or Japanese. So it's more $.
@DrMaryHicks Finally, my argument in that tweet was that reparations aren't welfare, and thus, that there is no earthly reason to pretend otherwise, given the political costs of doing so. If we're going to challenge majoritarian opinion on this, let's  do so in service of genuine reparations.
@DrMaryHicks It simply isn't the case that reparations has a similar amount of support as the other items on the left agenda, or that there isn't a significant difference in how programs that benefit a broad constituency vs a narrow one are perceived.
@DrMaryHicks It's not that anti-blackness would imperil *my* political priorities. It is that I fear it would imperil the wellbeing of the most vulnerable people in our society; which is to say, the African-American poor. I have much less to lose from reactionary backlash than they do.

@jbview I think such a project could help advance a (years/decades-long process of) progressive realignment. But I certainly hope that Sanders does not really believe there is a high-probability of Joe Manchin joining his political revolution, or of GOP senators voting for D.C. Statehood
@jbview Gotcha. Yeah, I agree with that bit. I think there is value in publicly contesting the notion that a state's GOP lean is a measure of the intensity of its commitment to "small government," and in trying to increase the salience of a (potentially unifying) 99% class identity.
@jbview Sure, sure. My narrow point is that I don't think taking the position that the GOP's ideological extremity (on econ) is largely the product of elite/activist pressures -- and thus, does not reflect mass ideological polarization -- would necessarily impair a president's efficacy.
@jbview 3) Trump and McConnell (ostensibly) don't think that the public is all-that polarized on bread and butter issues. If they did, they wouldn't feel compelled to disavow support for tax cuts on the rich, or pretend that their problem with Obamacare is high deductibles.
@jbview 2) But you don't need to trust the large body of polling data showing the GOP's fiscal agenda has little support among its non-activist base. You just need to accept that they haven't spent the past two years pretending to support the opposite of their actual agenda for no reason https://t.co/YajZoMVMW4
@jbview 1) I agree that Bernie exaggerates and simplifies on this question and most others (as politicians are wont to do, particularly when speaking off the cuff). And question wording matters...
Right before saying this, Sanders explained that the reason D.C. doesn't have statehood is that the GOP believes it would add two Democratic votes to the Senate. (IOW, he explained why filibuster abolition is a prerequisite then retreated into fantasy) https://t.co/8K0V85eb5Z
RT @_waleedshahid: Glenn Beck's explainer on the Green New Deal.		Oh. My. God. https://t.co/5BZ6NBAgO9
@jbview How so? D.C. statehood q aside, he seems pretty clear that his GOPcolleagues do not agree with him. His primary claim is that the extremity of their economic conservatism does not reflect the preferences of their constituents (which is true, if opinion polls can be believed).

@CoreyRobin Yeah. As I indicated previously, I think that one plausible argument for alarm is that some of that fraction is heavily armed, and if/when a black/female/socialist president succeeds Trump, far-right political violence may become a significant problem.
@CoreyRobin Anyhow, there's a version of your critique I agree with.  I just feel that, while you land a clean punch on Tim Snyderesque catastrophism, some of the "Trump's illiberalism/authoritarianism is bad for democracy" args are more nuanced/narrow, and require different counterarguments

@CoreyRobin Separately, I feel like a lot of Trump alarmism is premised on the idea that his words have the power to radicalize the faithful (as opposed to persuading the unconverted), in which case there's no real tension with GLT.
@CoreyRobin Maybe I'm not looking at the right definition. But I feel like there's a big difference between "a president's words significantly influence civic life" and this theory: https://t.co/c80uRm76xn
@CoreyRobin Both. https://t.co/eBAs6Ofo3F

@irenecolth @Noahpinion @willwilkinson @gabriel_mathy (My claim is that the war gave new sanction and intensity to anti-Japanese animus, while also emboldening the state to give it greater formal expression through internment camps.)
@irenecolth @Noahpinion @willwilkinson @gabriel_mathy I don't understand how that fact is inconsistent with the metaphor of "unleash" -- which implies a pre-existing entity that has become uncontrolled/gained freer reign.

@Noahpinion @willwilkinson @gabriel_mathy But World War 2 also unleashed vicious anti-Japanese racism at home, and like all our wars, trained legions of young  men to commit violence and dehumanize others, many of whom failed to leave those habits overseas, or channel them solely at Nazis, rather than domestic outgroups.

@OsitaNwanevu @whstancil But if it is true that Trump is only very incrementally increasing the power of the executive, then I'm not sure I grok the alarmist reading of this development.
@OsitaNwanevu @whstancil Yeah. I think that's all correct -- with the caveat that aggressive interpretations of existing laws give the executive plausible legal authority to make a lot of policy unilaterally (assuming, of course, friendly courts).
@whstancil Devil's Advocate: Given how undemocratic -- and, incapable of meaningfully addressing climate crisis -- the existing legislative system is, why isn't increasing the policymaking power of the president (who is typically directly elected by the public) the best of our bad options?
@whstancil My laudatory tweet about it wasn't 100% earnest. But assuming it remains unpopular -- and is blocked by the courts -- what's the case for alarm? Or does the alarmist case hinge on the significant risk that this will be rubber-stamped?

@thegarance @AlexCKaufman @AOC Running, sure. Beating an incumbent with a massive, devoted following of small-dollar donors, and a superabundance of charisma and political talent? I'm...skeptical
@jonathanchait @jbouie Yeah, that part I get. My discrete point is that socialists are trying to mainstream their ideology by equating liberal ideas like universal health-care and full employment with socialism. And you are symbiotically aiding that project when you draw the same equivalence.
@jonathanchait @jbouie Right, right. Anyhow, I don't disagree with your initial observation. But I feel that, in describing the GND (a resolution that has the support of many dozens in Congress) as "socialism," you are also exaggerating that creed's prevalence/influence within the Democratic Party
@jonathanchait @jbouie A lot of self-identified "moderates" support a greens jobs guarantee, which seems like the most "socialist" provision in the entire package.  https://t.co/zmpq4x6ZJt
@jonathanchait @jbouie Right. Yeah, it's tricky. And I've occasionally used them interchangeably. I guess the one bit I objected to in your usage was this: I think a lot of self-identified liberals support the GND, largely because (as the name implies) it is a left-liberal, not socialist, proposal https://t.co/qWMIXjWLGT
@jonathanchait @jbouie Similarly, you described the Green New Deal as socialist in your latest critique, but the GND does not call for the nationalization of high finance, or universal workplace democracy, but merely for large expansions in the welfare state and public hiring.
@jonathanchait @jbouie What is your definition of socialism? AOC identified as a socialist (largely to secure the DSA's endorsement) but defines that term in a manner that makes it largely indistinguishable from left liberalism (i.e. certain basic goods should be decommodified and guaranteed as rights)

@JamesSurowiecki @JHWeissmann @MattBruenig @chrislhayes That's fair.
@JamesSurowiecki @JHWeissmann @MattBruenig @chrislhayes Other view is that this will irreversibly associate climate policy with leftwing radicalism in the public imagination. I'm more sympathetic to the former hypothesis.
@JamesSurowiecki @JHWeissmann @MattBruenig @chrislhayes Gotcha. Yeah, it's speculative. The "Overton window" worshippers would say that staking out a wild, maximally leftwing climate vision allows self-styled moderates to embrace ambitious clean energy measures while retaining a "crazy left" to define themselves against.
@JamesSurowiecki @JHWeissmann @MattBruenig @chrislhayes I have trouble understanding how one could think that the GND has not, on net, increased the prospects for passage of ambitious climate legislation in the medium-term, given how little attention climate was attracting before AOC arrived in Congress.
@JamesSurowiecki @JHWeissmann @MattBruenig @chrislhayes This is what Bush did with tax cuts, and Obama with health-care. Anyhow, I'm not saying that I think the strategy will necessarily work. But it isn't illogical -- and last week, a climate policy proposal trended on Twitter, dominated headlines, and attracted a response from Trump
@JamesSurowiecki @JHWeissmann @MattBruenig @chrislhayes I mean, I think on broad level, it describes almost all of American politics. You build a coalition with a wide variety of concerns, but put one priority above all others, and leverage your support from various factions on behalf of that top goal.
@JamesSurowiecki @JHWeissmann @MattBruenig @chrislhayes ...if that's what Jon Tester and Joe Manchin are willing to sign off on. Bernie argued for the necessity of single-payer for decades, then voted for the ACA. Arguing for the grand vision did not block incremental progress.
@JamesSurowiecki @JHWeissmann @MattBruenig @chrislhayes Intellectuals and movements can argue for a grand policy vision, and insist that its components are inextricable. But the legislative process is a different thing. There won't be one bill. And there's no reason to think progressives won't vote for clean energy investment alone...
@JamesSurowiecki @JHWeissmann @MattBruenig @chrislhayes As for precedent, an exact analogy doesn't immediately come to mind. But it's fairly normal for political movements to promote a sweeping policy vision -- in which one issue enjoys pride of place -- and to then leverage support for the broader program into action on the top goal.
@JamesSurowiecki @JHWeissmann @MattBruenig @chrislhayes But when Democrats have a chance to actually legislate, all these moving parts will be separated into discrete bills. The committee process (and existence of the Senate) ensures that. The CPC will not vote down ambitious climate bill in 2021 because it doesn't include a UBI.
@JamesSurowiecki @JHWeissmann @MattBruenig @chrislhayes Yeah. I get that concern. But I don't it's actually an issue. You can roll all these policies together when you're writing a resolution that's supposed to function primarily as a vision statement (and litmus test for Dems who want to avoid progressive primary challengers)...
@JamesSurowiecki @JHWeissmann @MattBruenig @chrislhayes You can make the speculative claim that this will not actually succeed as a means of moving climate up the party's list of priorities. But the idea is coherent: Wed stuff people care about deeply to climate, so as to increase the salience of the latter.
@JamesSurowiecki @JHWeissmann @MattBruenig @chrislhayes In the absence of organic mass interest in climate, a rational way to center climate policy in progressive circles is to rename the entire left agenda "the Green New Deal" (a term not meant to describe a discrete bill, but a package of legislation ala the New Deal/Great Society).

2) Doesn't mean a majority of Americans wouldn't support the policy if they fully understood it. And one can reasonably argue that a fair framing M4A must include the fact that a large majority of Americans would save money from the transition.

@DoctorVive Yeah. I just don't think it needs to be. Point isn't that our political system is impervious to majoritarian opinion, just indifferent to it in the absence of popular mobilization. (i.e. "power concedes nothing without a demand)
@DoctorVive Structural barriers to majoritarian rule is definitely a large part of our problem. But even without them, Republicans would still run an awful lot of this country.

@whstancil 2) But I also think asserting the political irrelevance of a historic economic crisis -- or of material conditions during a time of rising inequality, austerity, and wage stagnation for middle-income people in the US/Europe -- should come with a heavy burden of proof.
@whstancil 1) This seems implausible to me in the cases of Greece, Spain, Ireland, or Italy, to name a few. I agree that popular intuitions about its influence need more empirical backing and shouldn't be accepted reflexively.
@whstancil I'm not talking about the U.S. only or even primarily. Social Democratic parties collapsed across most of Europe. In France, both major parties fell apart.
@whstancil The immense contingency in human affairs? I think the financial crisis did a great deal to delegitimize political Establishments. But there are a lot of other variables that influence electoral outcomes, and that delegitimization did not necessarily become immediately salient.
@whstancil ...which seems like a precondition for the emergence of populist figures who tap into preexisting xenophobia.

3) Piston's findings on the salience of "resentment of the rich" in the 2016 primary suggests that Sanders's socialism *as manifested in rhetoric* was more relevant to his appeal than previous data-driven analyses have suggested.
2) That might seem obvious, but there's been a lot of sound polling data showing that the average Sanders voter's policy preferences weren't more leftwing than the average Clinton one. Which made it reasonable to concluded Sanders appeal didn't have much to do with his leftism.

@whstancil Gotcha. So is the practical conflict here then about emphasis? Like: Is your view that it's quixotic for Dems to aim to increase the salience of class, given the wattage of racial divides, instead of targeting the emerging (college-educated) anti-racist majority, as Clinton did?
@whstancil We are dealing with limited evidence. But imo, the proposition that -- if there is a widely resented social group that makes up a tiny fraction of the electorate, and is associated with the other party, it is pragmatic to appeal to that resentment -- has empirical support.
@whstancil I still feel like you are arguing with a strawman. I admit my piece could have strengthened by a "to be sure" paragraph on the other dynamics that could explain why resentment of the rich was less predictive of support for Democrats in 2016.
@whstancil I don't see any tension between the premises "racial attitudes are the major fault line in American politics today" and "swing voters still exist, and one source of advantage Democrats have with them is that the GOP is associated with rich people, who are widely resented."
@whstancil I'm open to that being true. But I don't think I've seen any evidence for it. Resentment of the rich does not correlate tightly to income level (or, to my knowledge, education). https://t.co/rD63ZPtYK0
@whstancil Your position is that class war rhetoric does genuinely hurt Democrats with winnable, non-racist whites, while helping the party too modestly with racist ones to make a difference?
@whstancil But my argument isn't that one was more significant than the other, only that the former did not help (and like everything else in an election close, could theoretically have been decisive), and that it would therefore be pragmatic for Democrats to use such rhetoric in the future
@whstancil 3) ...to consciously seek to increase the salience of class resentment, just as it has often been in the GOP's interest to increase the salience of racial enmity.
@whstancil 2) The piece stipulates that racial resentment is an important force shaping voting behavior. It suggests that class resentment is as well and that in a country that is majority white -- and majority non-rich -- it is in the Democratic Party's interest...
@whstancil 1) I have limited space and time to write these things, and didn't intend to offer a comprehensive analysis of 2016. But I don't see how my point is in tension with the obvious reality that race played a huge role in that election.
Democrats are more unified now than they have been in quite some time. But one question that still sharply divides the party's mainstream from its left flank is this: Does our story of the middle-class's decline need a ruling-class villain? https://t.co/gUriW5sdsu https://t.co/kcq9aCMt0H
RT @ColinJMcAuliffe: @EricLevitz And despite high levels of polarization by age on most issues, thinking that the rich have more than they…
In 2012, Obama cast Romney as an out of touch plutocrat, and won the support of voters who "resent the rich."		But in 2016, "resentment of the rich" did not correlate with support for the Democratic nominee. And it isn't hard to see why: https://t.co/gUriW5sdsu https://t.co/seAf8zmuD1
Moderate Democrats have every right to praise the “patriotism” of America’s plutocrats, and deride the “nasty divisiveness” of their party's populists. But when they do so, they are prioritizing their ideological purity over defeating Donald Trump. https://t.co/gUriW5sdsu
A majority of voters resent rich people, and worry that the GOP is too sympathetic to them. For this reason, when Democrats "attack" the wealthy -- and increase the salience of class resentments -- their vote share tends to go up. Populism *is* pragmatism.	https://t.co/gUriW5sdsu

@ryanlcooper But I don't actually know if there's actual research backing up this theory
@ryanlcooper You may be right. Have just heard that giving seniors Medicare turned them more conservative across the board, as proposals for expanding socialism to other groups began to seem like a threat to theirs (GOP rhetoric on M4A seems to presume the existence of this anxiety).
@ryanlcooper Not endorsing taking it away. But I do fear that lowering the age to 55 -- without (at least) simultaneously establishing a universal public option -- would be the kind of reform that makes more radical change harder, not easier.

@Noahpinion @DanRiffle Do you think that Oprah would not have made (/would not continue to make) her positive contributions to society if she were less well-compensated for her efforts? I haven't modeled it, but my gut says The Optimal Level of Oprah Wealth lies well under $1 billion.
@ryanlcooper It is probably true that raising the Medicare retirement age would strengthen support for *any* other universal health-care program (and for M4A in particular) by expanding the constituency for it. Which is why *lowering* the age to 55 is a dangerous incremental move imo.
@DanielPKrouse @mattyglesias (I think there is some real risk to capital in having so much wealth concentrated in the hands of so many different individual human beings, whose political activities, unlike those of corporations, aren't disciplined by the profit imperative)
@DanielPKrouse @mattyglesias Not sure I've seen it quantified. But my sense is that Matt's right. Corporate PACs are inherently reactionary. But individual billionaires are often idiosyncratic and ideologically-motivated in way not wholly dissimilar to, say, upper-middle class DSAers are.

@deconstructall @libbycwatson @JStein_WaPo @adamslily Which doesn't mean that Democratic candidates shouldn't push hard for M4A, or that their advocacy can't change things (at the very least by accelerating a longer-term process of making it possible). But the case for pessimism about its near-term chances strikes me as quite strong
@deconstructall @libbycwatson @JStein_WaPo @adamslily For now, M4A's best poll numbers come in surveys where it is either not defined, or described as an alternative to (rather than a replacement of) private insurance. When asked, voters prefer a public option. And that's before M4A's enemies have hit the airwaves in force.
@deconstructall @libbycwatson @JStein_WaPo @adamslily Opposition will come not only from insurers and pharma, but from (at least some) doctors groups and hospitals (i.e. constituencies the public sympathizes with to some degree) who don't want rate cuts. Insurance industry employees are likely to mobilize against it, as well.
@deconstructall @libbycwatson @JStein_WaPo @adamslily Things won’t stay the same. But the kind of change required to pass the nationalization of a dominant industry through a body where Democrats have a slim majority — and rely on Manchin and Tester for said majority —  is much more profound than anything we’ve seen, imo.
@libbycwatson @JStein_WaPo @adamslily It's certainly worth paying attention to, anyway. But I feel like it'd be better if we/activists shifted the conversation to (left ideas about) regulatory policy, where candidates can make promises that they'll have the direct power to break or keep.
@libbycwatson @JStein_WaPo @adamslily Certainly not. Will say tho: In my estimation, Medicare For All will be impossible to get 50 Senate votes on for a very, very long time, absent an extraordinary (and highly unlikely, given significant pockets of labor opposition) mass mobilization demanding it.
@libbycwatson @JStein_WaPo @adamslily That said, the fact that her adviser brought this up today seems like signal that Harris plans to talk less about abolishing private insurance from now on. Which, if true, would be a kind of walk back, given that fervent advocacy is one of many many preconditions for passing M4A
@libbycwatson @JStein_WaPo @adamslily Bernie Sanders cosponsored Medicaid Buy-In bill in 2017 https://t.co/En1obPd0ik		So, technically, Kamala and Bernie have the same position on this -- if something more limited than M4A can pass and M4A can't, they are both officially down.

@DavidAstinWalsh @JoshuaHol But I agree, Trump doesn't lose the shutdown w/o Pelosi's work. And he probably still loses it w/o the airport problems, it just takes a bit longer.
@DavidAstinWalsh @JoshuaHol 3. The scope of progressive change that can be achieved through Nancy Pelosi being good at her job is much narrower than that which can achieved through workers shutting down chokepoints in the economy. So it seems worthwhile to emphasize the role of labor in yesterday's events.
@DavidAstinWalsh @JoshuaHol 1. Nancy Pelosi is very good at her job. 		2. Nancy Pelosi being very good at her job does not make it *absolutely intolerable* for Republicans to shutdown the government. Nonfunctional airports do.
@DavidAstinWalsh Yeah, we'll see. I think that the discovery (reminder) that workers can make life very hard for the people who rule them, very fast, could have beneficent consequences. Haven't had an object lesson like this in a good while.
@DavidAstinWalsh Yup. A few more days, homeboy would have proved Susan Sarandon right.
Trump came so close to blowing the whole conservative project. The left *dreams* of a socialist movement capable of fomenting a general strike -- after creating a cultural context in which said strike would enjoy overwhelming popular support. A GOP president almost did it for'em.

@WilliamHogeland I certainly understand and respect that position. But I think the fact that self-rule had such a robust definition (and a material component) — back before elites had to pretend to believe that *all* Americans were entitled to it — is both fascinating, and potentially useful.
@WilliamHogeland Yeah. Your account of the founding certainly makes that clear. (Again, my main contention isn't that the founders supported economic equality, merely that they saw concentrated wealth and self-government by the masses as incompatible, and therefore opposed the latter).
@WilliamHogeland My reading of the founders' conception of republican liberty, and the relationship between political and economic power, I cribbed from Aziz Rana's The Two Faces of American Freedom and Robert Dahl's Preface to Economic Democracy, among other things.
@WilliamHogeland Right, my appreciation for the importance of egalitarian ideas to many of the American Revolution's foot soldiers  derives from Founding Finance.

Joe Biden and Beto O'Rourke both helped their favorite vulnerable GOP incumbents win reelection last year. I wrote about why that should disqualify them from leading the Democratic Party in 2020. https://t.co/4hdsBwpyOB https://t.co/o5J7EBXCZk

@cobonics Hurd and Upton voted to make Paul Ryan speaker, and would have made Kevin McCarthy speaker if they'd kept the House. If you believe it is important for there to be a check on Trump, then it was grossly irresponsible to help vulnerable Republicans win reelection in 2018.
Trump's disapproval rating just hit all-time highs in two different polls. An overwhelming majority of the public wants the government reopened without funding for his wall. https://t.co/KQ76CqCtSt
@HenryPorters Earmarks are good. Helping Republicans win reelection at a time when the GOP had an outside shot of retaining the House -- and thus, emboldening a historically dangerous president -- is a very bad thing for someone who wants to lead the Democratic Party at this moment to do.
@Amanda_Kerri @onlxn Publicly praising him in the context of a midterm campaign was not a responsible thing for someone invested in improving medical outcomes for Americans to do.
@Amanda_Kerri @onlxn In 2017, Upton supported health-care legislation that would have undermined protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions, and increased the number of Americans without health insurance by 20 million over a decade.
@jonathanchait Imo, makes better sense tactically to redefine what it means to be a partisan Democrat in a leftward direction, than to tell partisan Ds (just about the most progressive voting bloc we've got) that they need to choose between pride in their party and social democratic ideology.
@jonathanchait That was certainly unfortunate. I think he should join the party and punch from within the tent, ala AOC.
I get why proud Democrats would resent Bernie for refusing to put a D next to his name. 		I don't get why they would resent him more than self-professed Democrats who help Republicans (including one who *helped lead the ACA repeal effort*) win reelection. https://t.co/XPHOwyNSv7
So, both Beto and Biden spent part of 2018 helping vulnerable House Republicans win reelection (in a context where multiple conservative pundits were begging their readers to vote D in House races, for the sake of the republic). https://t.co/QwD9rp8Axc https://t.co/88rN8Tkf3g
@nathansnewman @OsitaNwanevu The first result just doesn't make sense to me -- 43 percent support the border wall in principle, but *not* if it's the only way to end the shutdown? https://t.co/EIGD4rlJCs
@nathansnewman @OsitaNwanevu One result says that only 7 percent of people support the border wall if we stipulate that it is the *only* way the government will ever reopen.		Other result says that 52 percent believe the Democrats should vote for wall funding right now, for the sake of ending the shutdown.
@OsitaNwanevu I feel like some voters might be objecting the premise of the question. I think the two results are hard to reconcile unless one stipulates that something in the wording of each primes a different response. Regardless, both polls show overwhelming opposition to Trump's stance. https://t.co/oJ48mlWAB4

@yeselson @UOJim yeah. I just wouldn't do it by itself on the expectation that the next bite of the apple will be easier.
@UOJim @yeselson Makes sense to me. I guess I'm sort of attracted by the idea of making working-class GOP constituencies (even cops) confront the fact that the party they vote for does not care about their material needs. But I agree, narrowing the circle of worthiness is dangerous.
@yeselson @UOJim I worry about that expanding Medicare to those over 55 just eliminates a major constituency/source of pressure for a strong public option/Medicare For All (and creates a larger constituency that sees expanding socialized medicine as a threat to their own).
@LemieuxLGM @Atrios ...When introducing her before a rally in NYC during the primary, Schumer criticized "the other side" for trying divide people of different "races, religions, *and income levels*" (I'm paraphrasing). I feel like that was somewhat representative of the spirit of her campaign.

@yeselson @UOJim But he is actually touting this as president Brown's vision for health-care reform?
@yeselson @UOJim I'm confused by this. On first glance, I'd assumed that this was specifically intended as a proposal for the 116th Congress -- like, try to force the GOP into taking the "anti-cop" side of an issue during a time of divided government. Which seems fine to me.

@HeerJeet @michaelbd @michelleinbklyn @MatthewSitman tbf, our society does teach kids that such things are basically fine. (See: The traditional cheers of the Atlanta Braves, Washington Redskins, innumerable high-school sports teams that have Native American mascots, etc...)
@michaelbd @michelleinbklyn @MatthewSitman (But I don't think that changes the question of what happened, or what the available evidence would suggest happened.)
@michaelbd @michelleinbklyn @MatthewSitman I think the amount of attention this has gotten is regrettable, and the way social media processes any piece of raw video is bound to fall short of conventional journalistic ethics. I think the world might well be a better place if this hadn't been caught on camera.

@yeselson Thanks Rich!
@hamandcheese Given implications of corporate tax cuts for distribution of income (among other things), have a hard time buying the notion that TCJA is net-progressive.
@hamandcheese I agree the MID bit was good; am ambivalent about the SALT thing (solely because I worry it will hamper social democratic governance in blue states by eliminating a mechanism for de facto deficit financing).
@hamandcheese And, as indicated in the piece, I think there are also substantive reasons for starting at the top. That said, some blue states have been making real progress on exclusionary zoning lately.
@hamandcheese Right. I do think the coalition issues you identify are real. But if there is no viable majority coalition for significantly combatting rentiers -- that *doesn't* some middle-class "Dream Hoarders" -- then focusing on the super-rich makes some sense.

@OsitaNwanevu @whstancil @whet 3) I am not saying that this means the former aren't nonetheless worthwhile, or that I am sure such a tension exists in practice. It seems to me that within the blue coalition, this kind of discourse is doing immense good.
@OsitaNwanevu @whstancil @whet 2) but reactionary tendencies on others, constitutes evidence of a *potential* tension between confrontational modes of advocating social justice and near-term policy gains.
@OsitaNwanevu @whstancil @whet 1) That is also my position. The challenge obviously is that we ostensibly have to work within those structures in order to change them.

@OsitaNwanevu @whstancil @whet Not the hard evidence you seek (since Shor doesn't attribute the polarization he describes to more confrontational modes of pursuing social justice).

@OsitaNwanevu That does seem like a fairer reading (I sort of elided "often"). Appreciate the response.
@NoFuncDemo @OsitaNwanevu But imo there is a strain of "ID pol" discourse that is needlessly anti-solidaristic; that conjures monolithic, de-classed identity categories, and then insists that social harms which are experienced across groups are the exclusive burden of those who suffer them most severely.
@NoFuncDemo @OsitaNwanevu Yeah. I'm not saying that the piece's point isn't worthwhile -- that gender non-comformity comes with higher costs for people whose ethnic identity (or, imo, body type) already divorces them from the dominant, racialized beauty ideal.

@ddayen 4) ...strikes me as consistent with Open Markets principles, not PPP ones. And how the left should tackle finance is arguably *the* most important question in that whole divide.
@ddayen 3) Which is def not what Bernie believes. But he saw tactical value in the proposal, so he went with it. More significantly, his enthusiasm for breaking up the big banks, instead of nationalizing or more heavily regulating them...
@ddayen 2) But I also think Bernie's approach to policymaking is so flexible and heterogenous, the distinctions become muddied once you move out of rhetoric and into policy. Like, the logic of the Bezos bill is that privately employed workers shouldn't rely on public social insurance...
@ddayen 1) Right, right. I definitely think there is a sharp ideological division between, for lack of better proxies, the "Open Markets" vs. "People's Policy Project" wings of the left. And I think that that divide is partially reflected in Sanders v. Warren.
@ddayen I could be wrong, but I see Sanders as being committed to a certain theory of political change and economic justice, but quite flexible/pragmatic on the question of how his egalitarian vision can be incrementally advanced on most policy fronts.
@ddayen So, I'm not sure a Sanders administration would have predictable differences from a Warren one in its handling of those agencies, as I think Bernie would be likely to delegate a lot of that policymaking to Warren types -- if not, to Warren herself.
@ddayen That's a fair point. I guess my view is that the biggest difference between Warren and Sanders on a lot of questions of regulatory policy is that the former is a wonk with detailed preferences/sophisticated ideas, while the latter isn't.

@ebruenig Thanks for clarifying, and apologies if I unintentionally misrepresented your views. My impression was that your anthropological critique of liberalism (which I find compelling) implied an openness to more official forms of state/public morality than many on the left endorse.
@CarlBeijer I don't think I disagree with any of this. There are limits to how much nuance one can express in a Slack chat. Also, in the context of that discussion of Jon's article, "left" was a catch-all for a faction broader than the avowedly socialist left: https://t.co/YTNIn6VFyv
@nathansnewman @jonathanchait makes sense
@jonathanchait (My impression tho is that in the org's lean years, some chapters came to be dominated by more doctrinaire types who have since seen their grip eroded by Bernie backers. The phenomenon you describe is probably true in some chapters)
@jonathanchait haha. Appreciate it. Think this is the kind of disagreement that can only be resolved through actual reporting -- and god knows neither of us want to do that.
@jonathanchait Separately, I think there are plenty of folks in the Democratic coalition who reject liberalism in the way that I mean. A lot of Americans will endorse Christian prayer in school, or banning certain forms of speech in opinion surveys.
@jonathanchait I'm not sure if that's true in our current context. If anything, I think  the Sanders's candidacy has produced the opposite phenomenon --  attracting large numbers of "liberal, electoralist" left social democrats types into orgs like DSA, which they now threaten to dominate.
@Aldowyn @CarlBeijer Separately, in the context of that discussion, "left" is a stand-in for the prominent progressive media personalities whom Chait critiqued by name in his piece, a group that included folks who do not even identify as socialists.
@Aldowyn @CarlBeijer not that socialists proudly identify as liberals, or that a core aspect of their project hasn't been to critique liberalism (in no small  part by demonstrating its failure to deliver on its ideals for the vast  majority of working people), or that no anti-enlightment left exists)
@Aldowyn @CarlBeijer Alright. My view is that Marx thought the enlightenment was a good thing, and that his intellectual project tacitly endorsed a wide array of liberal premises in the broadest sense of that term, including some that I suspect Bruening challenges...
@Aldowyn @CarlBeijer https://t.co/5G1xf59vY9
@GOPPollAnalyst Thanks! But it had the "fear-mongering" hed from the moment it was published (took a marginally different tack in my tweet)!
2) And I think this view is even more ubiquitous among the social democrats who make up the bulk of the actually-existing American left. My (wrong?) impression is that Liz's rejection of liberalism is more sweeping, and includes some aspects that many on the left tend to accept.
Confusion is semantic I think. There are many socialists who endorse liberalism's reverence for individual rights, secular pluralism, and belief in the possibility of human progress -- but maintain that socialism is the only way to realize such ideals. https://t.co/MX9m17UKfr

Few pretend we're dealing with "Tweedledum and Tweedledee" anymore.
@yeselson @jeffspross @jonathanchait I just think the conflationists are overrepresented in the center-left imagination (in part because, in trying to heighten contradictions within the Dem tent, a lot of leftists who recognize the stakes of keeping the GOP out of power deploy rhetoric that suggests otherwise.)
@jeffspross @jonathanchait 3) I'm personally on team "let's push for social democracy because it's good, and because implementing ambitious programs could pay political dividends once in power -- but it probably won't make much difference in 2020 how leftwing the Dem platform is, from an electoral pov."
@jeffspross @jonathanchait 2) Many on the left believe it is supremely important to disempower a proto-fascist GOP -- which is *why* the Democratic Party must be ideologically transformed, since left-neoliberalism has proven impotent against the populist right in many western countries.
@jeffspross @jonathanchait 1) I think the piece's main point is broadly correct, and also, that tabling the question of "who's right" ideologically and politically was fine. But (as Jeff's complaint suggests) I think this is might be an overstatement: https://t.co/Daafgl5ChM

@CoreyRobin (But I also know very little about all of this)
@CoreyRobin The examples you cite are all of evils that could be only be halted militarily by destroying a functioning state (and thereby inviting anarchic violence down on large numbers of innocents). I don’t know that protecting a functioning Kurdish government is analogous.

@DanaHoule @pescami @LemieuxLGM @HeerJeet @haroldpollack @jbouie @JeffYoung (as Hillary did during her first run for public office in 2000)
@DanaHoule @pescami @LemieuxLGM @HeerJeet @haroldpollack @jbouie @JeffYoung imo, the basis for saying Biden is a better pol is both (subjective) judgement about his performance as an orator, and (objective) fact that he won election to a County Council and then the Senate w/o having the energetic backing of the most powerful people in Dem politics
3) Since (at least some of) those interests have more sway over the median Democratic lawmaker than the median Niskanen Center intellectual, the latter tends to be more progressive on a variety of economic issues (healthcare/inclusive zoning/patents, etc...)
2) It's about whether (/to what degree) democratic institutions should be allowed to curb the privileges of extractive economic interests. So many areas of policy aren't defensible in rational/util terms, but don't need to be. They are set by the balance of forces, not ideas.
1) Many (most?) Niskanen staffers would be on the leftwing of Nancy Pelosi's caucus. The left-right divide in (irl) US politics isn't about how to balance statist vs. market-oriented approaches to social/economic problems... https://t.co/AmfLV4NmKX
@HeerJeet I don't think they are even the rightwing of the Democrats, tbh. Since they live in the realm of ideas, not power politics, they appear much more comfortable with drastic expansions of the Welfare State than the median House Dem (or at least, some of their writers are)

@pescami @HeerJeet @haroldpollack @jbouie @JeffYoung But I agree equating those liabilities with weakness as a candidate probably overestimates how ideological the Democratic primary electorate is/underestimates the importance of retail political skill
@pescami @HeerJeet @haroldpollack @jbouie @JeffYoung Hardly a far-right position (if majoritarian sentiment is our metric), but in substantive terms, opposition to busing was devastating for integration. I think that "same negatives" makes sense if read as "all the same substantive liabilities on his record as HRC, from a left POV"
@pescami @HeerJeet @haroldpollack @jbouie @JeffYoung It's true he's a better politician. But it isn't just the crime bill. It's opposition to integration, support for a bankruptcy bill that favored credit card companies over consumers, Iraq War, Anita Hill hearing, opposition to "partial birth abortion," among other things
@whstancil @jbouie @OsitaNwanevu I think Biden is a strong candidate until the debates, when his 35 rivals each pick (at least) one heresy in his record to decry/define themselves against. (Say, Booker going ham on integration, Warren on bankruptcy, Gillibrand on Anita Hill, etc...)

@yeselson @gabrielwinant @BigMeanInternet Seems to me the argument isn't about when Du Bois was cool, but about whether leftwing movements have historically relied on some degree of nationalism to achieve mass appeal. I lack expertise here, but just doesn't seem like a fair characterization of Rich's position.
(Imo, if there is an enemy here, it is the common one of platform monopolies that are commandeering the value that *everyone* in our organization works tirelessly to create).
3) I'm hopeful that unionization will ultimately help our organization find a way to reconcile our various ambitions with the challenges of this moment, in a fair and transparent way.
2) I also have a great deal of admiration for our staff, who've found a way to produce great journalism -- at the obscene pace that the internet requires -- while making rent in this unaffordable city, staying sane in the Trump era, and, in some cases, raising actual human babies
1) fwiw, I have a great deal of admiration for NYMag's management and ownership. In trying times for our industry, they've found a way to grow our readership -- and maintain our editorial standards -- all while avoiding the mass layoffs that have devestated other newsrooms.

@BigMeanInternet @yeselson @gabrielwinant Among my hang-ups: I see no democratic demand for degrowth. And given how rare it is for masses to overcome elite opposition to secure things they desperately want, I don't see how you overcome elite opposition to an idea that is (at least, as of now) utterly anti-majoritarian.
@BigMeanInternet @yeselson @gabrielwinant I'd be open to hearing the story for how that happens/the case for believing that it can achieved.
@BigMeanInternet @yeselson @gabrielwinant I think if one accepts the premise that preventing climate apocalypse requires the abolition of the nation-state -- and the deliberate, permanent suppression of economic growth in the developed world -- within the next decade, then there is no preventing the climate apocalypse.
@BigMeanInternet @gabrielwinant @yeselson I should stipulate: Whatever is expedient on the level of rhetoric (which is what we're arguing about here) not policy. (I realize that might still earn your grimaces)
@gabrielwinant @yeselson ...and we can worry about transcending nationalism later, when the proto-fascists no longer control the world's most powerful military." (Or, something to that effect)
@gabrielwinant @yeselson Gotcha. I'm not sure how much we disagree then. I guess, I'm maybe just more sympathetic to the argument, "The left should do whatever is expedient to gain power over the American nation-state, because that is a monstrously difficult task and tremendous prize...
@gabrielwinant @yeselson Whereas, I don't really see how "Actually, American values *are* white supremacist values, and if you want to be a part of the movement for giving poor people health-care, you must be ashamed of your country," will get us anywhere.
@gabrielwinant @yeselson I get that. I agree Constitution worship is a problem. But I also think you need to meet people where they are...you can use consensus tropes like "all (wo)men are created equal" to make a case for radically revising the Constitution.
@gabrielwinant @yeselson What's the trap, in concrete terms? Like, what political problem is created down the line if we point to the most egalitarian impulses expressed in our founding documents as the truest expression of American values? That it leads to undue reverence for the Constitution?
@gabrielwinant @yeselson ...while refusing to avail yourself of your country dominant tropes, myths, and political vernacular when attempting to popularize your ideology seems self-defeating, imo.
@gabrielwinant @yeselson But the (hard-won) mythic reinterpretation of our founding ideals -- that Americanism is rooted in egalitarianism and thus, requires a rejection of ethno-nationalism -- is potentially politically useful...

@matt_sussis I recognize that the data you cite raises the complication that taking in more refugees could theoretically create more by increasing emissions, but this seems like a long way of saying when human beings' living standards increase in a carbon-based economy...
@matt_sussis You also misconstrue the nature of my argument -- which is not that we need to take in refugees to make climate change less severe, but that we need to do so to prevent those refugees from being condemned to statelessness or death.
@matt_sussis My point is that I do not believe your opposition to large-scale immigration is rooted in good-faith concern for the climate. If you advocate for massive policy changes to discourage suburban sprawl or lower the U.S. birth rate, then I take the point back.

@DanMKervick @CoreyRobin I haven't studied the issue enough to confidently assess it. But her concerns do make intuitive sense to me. I do think that the problem might be less severe in a world with a more expansive immigration system -- but also, a more just international financial/trade system.
@DanMKervick @CoreyRobin Yeah. I am very sympathetic to that -- generally speaking, I feel like debating "open borders" is a stimulating intellectual exercise, but not much more than that.
@DanMKervick @CoreyRobin Perhaps, it seems to me that her piece strongly suggests that she finds the status quo levels of immigration unacceptably high; she suggests that, as is, immigration is devastating low-income workers in the U.S. and robbing developing countries of their finest minds.
@yeselson As I mention in the piece, I do find Hill's past apologetics for Farrakhan shameful (not least for the way it renders his analysis of Israel-Palestine easy to discredit).

@DanMKervick @CoreyRobin I have not put adequate thought into how much it should be expanded, how quickly, and using what criteria.

@ThePlumLineGS @MattBruenig @haroldpollack @BrendanNyhan Personally, if the party doing this were not also attempting to insulate their power from majoritarian rebuke through voter suppression and gerrymanders that courts have found plausibly unconstitutional, this excercise of power wouldn’t trouble me much.
@TankieSanders @MattBruenig @ThePlumLineGS @haroldpollack @BrendanNyhan Yeah, yeah -- I get that the legislators who drew the map were presumably popularly elected to offices that gave them the power to gerrymander. But that still leaves "how recently did this body receive a popular mandate" as a criterion for determining which is more legitimate.
@MattBruenig @ThePlumLineGS @haroldpollack @BrendanNyhan Feel like in that scenario, it isn't all that difficult, as a philosophical matter, to determine that the popularly elected governor is more legitimate. Even if that counts for nothing in practice
@MattBruenig @ThePlumLineGS @haroldpollack @BrendanNyhan I get this as a general point about divided powers vs. parliamentary systems. But does it apply to a hypothetical where, say, the party in control of the state assembly recieved far fewer total votes, and won a majority solely because of partisan districting?
@ThePlumLineGS @MattBruenig @haroldpollack @BrendanNyhan w/r/t democratic legitimacy: Worth noting that the governor was elected with a plurality of votes, while the GOP's state assembly majority is much larger than the party's share of votes.

@nathansnewman I'm skeptical that this is how legislators will interpret the rule in practice. But you're right that that's a important distinction and I was wrong to elide it.

@jasonhill__ This is why I used the word "precedents." The concern is that once these rules are established they will prove difficult to dispose of.
@wideofthepost @benwikler @ezralevin Yeah. I agree that Paygo is the strongest argument against her Based on her past remarks on Pete Peterson, I think there's decent evidence that Pelosi is a fiscal hawk true believer. But I think there's evidence that the most credible challenge to her speakerhip is from the right
@wideofthepost @benwikler @ezralevin I do not "carry water" for anyone; do not understand why MoveOn or Indivisible would be responsible; and think the voting reform bill that Dems plan to prioritize is immensely valuable (https://t.co/jGND3RaSye); I also don't think Pelosi is *the* force pushing the Dems right.
@LeftData It would only last for the duration of this Congress. So has little immediate consequence. But it sets a precedent that could be difficult to reverse.
I should clarify: Pelosi has reportedly endorsed these rules, but the driving force behind the supermajority for tax increases *appears* to be the more conservative Democrats who are trying to prevent her speakership. 	https://t.co/6Lia7bpeBw
@ConventusCentr because the reporting suggests the demand is coming from the more conservative Democratic lawmakers who are trying to prevent her speakership.
@SaysSimonson (Republicans just spent 2018 campaigning against Medicare cuts, for tax cuts, and a ever-higher military budget).
@SaysSimonson I agree that progressives often downplay the necessity of middle-class tax hikes (or else, deficit spending) to fund their most ambitious ideas for political reasons. I do think the right is even more dishonest about the trade-offs inherent to its fiscal agenda.
@SaysSimonson Democratic socialists have been arguing for raising taxes on the middle class -- as part of a universal health-care plan that would zero out their premiums, producing net household-savings -- for years now. Certainly not an easy lift politically, but not a new thing.
I don't think that's the intention here, but its what she'd be doing, for the ostensible purpose of sending a couple focus-group-approved messages.
Seriously, if Nancy Pelosi wants the House to establish a supermajority requirement for increasing taxes on the bottom 80 percent of Americans -- and a Paygo rule --  then she wants to make most of the progressive agenda impossible to pass.	https://t.co/exxETzTbpc
After many Dems campaigned on Medicare For All, the first thing the party plans to do in power is establish rules that bar the House from raising taxes on 80% of Americans -- and require it to fully finance all new programs -- precedents that would make M4A impossible to enact. https://t.co/AladbpsUzz

@RegresoDelMack @sarahcgchris @karpmj This is true in terms of opinion polling. But when Obama tried to redirect federal subsidies for higher education away from the tax-advantaged savings accounts used by the upper-middle class -- and into tax credits for working-class parents -- it wasn't the latter who stopped him
@RegresoDelMack ...and I think the latter will be difficult to do in a context where a majority of middle and low-income whites vote for Corporate America's preferred party. Which doesn't mean the Dems' existing coalition can't support vital incremental reforms (i.e. a public option).
@RegresoDelMack Appreciate it! And I think there's a lot to your critiques. But winning elections on socialistic slogans -- and passing radical, social democratic legislation through America's deeply conservative legislative institutions -- are different endeavors...

I would have liked to see a bit more engagement with the data points that complicate the piece's suggestion that college-educated whites are an inherently moderating influence on the Democratic Party...
I have quibbles with this @karpmj essay. But I think I endorse its broad conclusion (that there are hard limits to what can be achieved while Republicans retain the lion's share of votes from blue/pink collar whites). Anyhow, definitely worth a read. https://t.co/trv99aCcap

@CarlBeijer Absent the latter, however, merely replacing say, 20% of the Dems' upper middle-class white voters with working class ones probably won't make much difference.
@CarlBeijer Sure. My general view is that decommidifying any major sector of the economy can't be done with merely the passive support of voters (of any kind) in opinion polls, but only with a well-organized, mass movement.

@CarlBeijer 2) But I agree that radical/transformative change will require the (possibly, decades-long) project of reviving working-class politics that Karp prescribes. Laid out some of my thoughts on this subject here  https://t.co/VUdWaK3dBS
@CarlBeijer 1) Haven't gotten all the way through Matt's analysis yet (will soon) -- but yeah, I think I do regard it as more complication than refutation. I do think that it is possible for Democrats to pass reforms that will meaningfully help working people with their existing coalition.
Trump’s narcissistic compulsion to create attention-galvanizing  controversies is not an ingenious campaign tactic, let alone, one that should constrain Democratic messaging in 2020. https://t.co/uibQryfFFz
@SandraHelena39 @RegresoDelMack Yeah. There is a lot of political diversity within the category of "white, non-college voters," and the regional differences are profound. Such voters in the deep South tend to be far more reactionary than those from the labor movement's former bastions in the Midwest.
@SandraHelena39 @RegresoDelMack And this tendency, combined with the Senate's overrpresentation of such voters, means that it will be challenging to pass progressive legislation through the upper chamber in 2021, even if Democrats take the White House.
@SandraHelena39 @RegresoDelMack A reality of American politics, at this moment, is that states with high concentrations of white, non-college educated voters *tend* to elect conservative Republicans (despite the fact that such voters don't tend to hold rightwing economic views).
@SandraHelena39 @RegresoDelMack You are not listening closely to what I am saying.
@SandraHelena39 Where did I suggest that it did? My point is that the material interests of the voters that politicians rely on to win elections do not dictate their actions in office.

@danielmarans 1) The structure of the Senate, which (ironically) gives disproportionate influence to white working class voters who currently, in the aggregate, tend to elect politicians who vehemently oppose major expansions of the social safety net. 2) The public's aversion to tax hikes.
The Senate gives disproportionate influence to (white) working class voters. And the politicians whom the (voting portion of) that demographic currently elect are the primary obstacle to progressive reform of any kind.

@BigMeanInternet Sure. Fwiw, I enjoyed your past reflections on how Amazon's activities strengthen the case for a radical break with liberalism. https://t.co/TQxQlp6WwW
@BigMeanInternet I am pretty sure I would not have quote-tweeted that. My main objection was that the tweet diverted responsibility away from discreet liberal actors to "liberals" in general. Liberal Cuomo voters do bear more responsibility than others, though much much less than Cuomo himself.
@BigMeanInternet If Stoller had tweeted that he didn't want to hear about the Foxconn deal from any Democratic elected officials who are celebrating the Amazon HQ2 -- or that de Blasio's participation in the latter tarnishes American liberalism -- I wouldn't have objected.
@BigMeanInternet @DavidKlion (I am not ashamed of being a squishy, upper-middle-class, democratic socialism-curious social democrat. I just don't believe that that identity informs my every utterance)
@BigMeanInternet @DavidKlion I think all language is context dependent. There are definitely contexts in which the terms "liberals" and "leftists" describe distinct political philosophies. And while I do think Marxist thought derives out of the liberal tradition, it is obviously in tension with much of it.
@BigMeanInternet @DavidKlion I still would. I don't believe that that is why I said what I said.
@BigMeanInternet @DavidKlion If Matt did not mean "voters who identify as liberal" when he said "liberals," then I withdraw my criticism. If he did, then I believe we were operating from the same definition, and I stand by my claim that there are plenty of liberals who consistently oppose corporate welfare.
@BigMeanInternet @DavidKlion I think I see more value in meliorism than you do, and believe that the most viable alternative to ("bourgeois") democracy is not full communism, but the authoritarian right (and thus, that the former is worth preserving).
@BigMeanInternet @DavidKlion Sincere question: If you reject liberal values, where do you derive your commitment to egalitarianism from? Biblical sources, moral intuition? What makes exploitation wrong if individual human beings do not have fundamental rights?
@BigMeanInternet @DavidKlion I think that term has too many overlapping meanings to be useful in this context. Many socialists do not consider their project to be a repudiation of liberalism's highest ideals, but rather, as the only means of actually delivering on them (/maximizing true individual freedom).
@DavidKlion @BigMeanInternet Sure. Just seems pretty orthogonal to my point, given that Stoller generally uses the phrase "liberals" to describe ordinary voters who identify with that term (and who, generally, are the constituency within the Democratic Party that is most opposed to corporate subsidies).
@BigMeanInternet All this *might* be true of actually existing liberalism. But I believe that a better world is possible.
@BigMeanInternet Most ordinary people in the United States who consider themselves liberals do not subscribe to that definition of liberalism, but merely understand the term to mean "someone who has left-of-center political opinions."
@BigMeanInternet and I think it unduly legitimizes this kind of thing to pretend that its an expression of New York liberals' hypocrisy rather than Democratic misrule.
@BigMeanInternet Wouldn't it make more sense to phrase the tweet as "I don't want to hear the New York Democratic Party leadership complain about Scott..." then? In general, I think there is a pretty huge disconnect between the actions of elected officials and the will of their constituents.
Because “liberals” collectively approved this deal in a referendum? What self-described liberals are defending this? https://t.co/HchxAQXZxk

@BenjySarlin Right. I think your hypothesis is totally plausible. But I also think there's evidence that the electorate was already polarizing along lines of education before Trump, and that he might have accelerated this process, and thus, brought it to heretofore deeply GOP suburbs.
@BenjySarlin Sure. But there are a lot of districts in the US that Democrats regularly win by running as indepedent-minded moderates. It isn't reflected in the national brand or popular discourse but, it's a big part of how the party does politics. https://t.co/G5FxqzRC5v https://t.co/W41kBrnAyI
@BenjySarlin Interesting. Time will tell, I suppose. But I do think, pre-trump, affluent, college-educated suburbanites were already trending towards Democrats, in response to, among other things, the Christian and nativist right's growing domination of the GOP.
@BenjySarlin If the latter stop identifying as Republicans in opinion polls, I think there is a decent chance that many have durably realigned, as the identity groups they're embedded in have switched their partisan allegiance. (Which isn't to say they won't be swing voters in the future)
@BenjySarlin I think there's a distinction between the level of attachment that the typical NeverTrump Republican in professional politics has to the GOP, and that of the average surbanite who used to vote for the party in general elections.
Isn't the opposite position rooted in opinion polls showing that Trump has an unusually high in-party approval rating? And doesn't that mean many of these voters have stopped identifying as Republicans (and thus, are not currently Never Trump Republicans)? https://t.co/7GTW4Ejl0U
@chrislongview Got it. Concede isn't a technical, legal action, just a performative courtesy. So I don't think this distinction is very important. The Nelson campaign's words were taken as a concession by the opposing campaign and the press. He only corrected that impression once facts changed.

@WaywardWinifred @davidsirota I think Dems should run on progressive policies because they are good, and the risks of doing so are exaggerated.

@WaywardWinifred @davidsirota I agree that there might be longterm electoral benefits in building social movements around ambitious progressive policy ideas.

@HotlineJosh It also seems to me that Sean prepared a list of races meant to prove that progressivism wins elections -- rather than to refute the idea that it loses them. Almost every race on that list was not a toss-up but a reach for the Democratic Party, regardless of whom it nominated.
@HotlineJosh I know! I just don't see a uniform ideological pattern to the overall results, and thus, question if there really is a clear lesson for 2020. Hard to square Brown and Baldwin's victories with the notion that Dems can't win the Electoral College while embracing leftwing policy.

@OsitaNwanevu Honestly, if we're looking for signals about the prospects for progressive politics in the U.S., the survival of the gas tax in California seems like a stronger data point in favor -- and the defeat of a carbon tax in Oregon, a stronger point against -- than any individual race.

@jonathanchait My view is that charisma, strong ties to the state/district, -- and say, a talent for describing left-of-center politics in a vernacular of civic nationalism -- are way more constitutive of electability than a voting record that pleases No Labels or the Chamber of Commerce.
@jkfecke Agreed. But he isn't in Josh's estimation, nor in that of most of the mainstream commentariat. And I think the ways he diverged from their model of a centrist are important, and it's worth pushing against this line of thought https://t.co/KvHLs7lCSx
@jkfecke Beto did not campaign how Democrats normally campaign in states that red. Donnelly and McCaskill flirted with opposing birthright citizenship -- O'Rourke wouldn't even condemn Kaepernick.
@ThorntonHall1 My prior is that candidate ideology matters far less than punditry suggests. The uniformity of these results lend some credence to the argument that it does (though less than Josh's tweet suggests, in my view)
2) Also, pretty sure Beto coming within 3 points of a Republican incumbent in Texas is an indication that he was a stronger candidate than the median centrist Dem https://t.co/Cj3et0bzpc
Definitely decent evidence against my priors. But I do find it odd to leave Tammy Baldwin and Sherod Brown -- progressives who outpaced somewhat more centrist gubernatorial candidates by leaps and bounds in the Rust Belt -- off the list. https://t.co/Cj3et0bzpc

@briebriejoy @nhannahjones @wewilovercome @mydogleonard @MattBruenig @DawgsWillHunt imo, the question is whether we can so much as *mitigate* economic injustice -- in a racist, majority-white country with an empowered rightwing -- without building cross-racial class solidarity, and thus, emphasizing the more universal dimensions of black Americans' plight.

@JoeKearns_PSU @rmc031 @ThorntonHall1 Nor do I think many would make that claim against Amy Klobuchar, who boasts one of the highest in-state approval ratings (when adjusted for partisanship) of any U.S. senator, and who will win reelection by a massive margin this fall.
@JoeKearns_PSU @rmc031 @ThorntonHall1 It's a fair point, though I think she went into the race with significant advantages. I will say, I don't think many people would accuse Tammy Baldwin of being an ineffective politician, because she has won elections as an unabashed progressive in an increasingly purple state.
@JoeKearns_PSU @rmc031 @ThorntonHall1 ...before becoming a major party's presidential nominee. This doesn't make her unique among presidential candidates (obviously). But the fact that she was relatively unproven as an effective campaigner lends some support to the notion that she was a relatively weak candidate, imo
@JoeKearns_PSU @rmc031 @ThorntonHall1 Yeah, that's a fair point. I guess, the other thing informing view here is the relatively unusual path Clinton took to the summit of electoral politics. Thanks to both her policy chops and relationship with Bill, she did not have to win any upsets/truly competitive elections...
@rmc031 @ThorntonHall1 @JoeKearns_PSU ... and thus, that he would have almost certainly wrecked Trump throughout the Rust Belt, in a world without term limits.
@rmc031 @ThorntonHall1 @JoeKearns_PSU That was also my primary intention in retweeting it. Judging from 95 percent of the post-2016 takes (including some of my own), you would never know that Barack Obama's approval rating was around 57 percent on Election Day...
@JoeKearns_PSU @rmc031 Yeah, a conspicuous factor. I'm certain Clinton's gender hurt her. But I also believe that she was a weak candidate for reasons independent of her gender. Warren isn't the world's greatest retail politician, but she totally outshined Clinton at their joint rallies in 2016.

@michaelbd It's not great. But quite plausible that it's a mistake rooted in sentimentality not cynicism -- and unambiguous that her professional accomplishments owe no debt to her unconventional claim to indigenous identity.
Point that's getting lost: In Warren's telling, she came to identify as Native because that was how her dad's (racist) parents regarded her mother. Her ID is based in an account of her mom's social reality, which the DNA test merely lent some credence to. https://t.co/UteuSaJbzA https://t.co/r9WtBd91id
@michaelbd Your view is that the relation is so distant in the test, that it actually undermines her narrative about her parents' marriage?
@michaelbd That's in the eye of the beholder I guess. I'm just pointing out that her official story isn't "I identified as Native American because 10 generations ago I had an ancestor," but rather, because that supposed ancestry profoundly shaped her immediate family's life.
@michaelbd The dna test merely adds credibility to that account
@michaelbd Warren’s story is a social construct narrative imo. She has long attributed her identification as Native American to the fact that her father’s family regarded her mother as such, and opposes their marriage on that basis. It was social stigma that made the identity relevant.

6) But asking Americans for their feelings on political correctness, in general, doesn't do much to illuminate our understanding about these kinds of divides.
5) I.e., a majority of "black and brown" people have either neutral or warm feelings about police officers. Feelings toward officers does not equal views on policy. But there is certainly a divide on this type of stuff between leftwing activists and the median POC. https://t.co/CcOiA9yVKn
4) All this said, I am sympathetic to the broader idea that online discourse exagerates how concerned working class, nonwhite voters are with rhetorical niceties, or even how "woke" they are on their own identity group's purported issues.
3) It wouldn't be surprising if Americans were united behind the sentiment "it is bad that concerns for political propriety keep politicians from telling it straight." But the entire conflict is over precisely what truths politicians can't speak.
2) If you polled "is it okay to call undocumented immigrants illegals?" or "does political correctness lead politicians to exaggerate the role of racism in keeping black people down," I'd bet you'd see the Team Woke vs. Team Resentful divide that Mounk insists doesn't exist.
1) This tells us so much less than Yascha implies. The survey never defines "political correctness." And yet, "PC" controversies in the real world are always manifest in debates over the propriety of specific sentiments, phrases, and words. 	https://t.co/o0b0yBAAZ4

But that seems like a misread.
@briebriejoy @adamjohnsonNYC @ChaseMadar 2) But Lisa Murkowksi  and Jeff Flake weren't going to vote against Kavanaugh because conservative jurisprudence is bad for consumers. If Dems top priority was killing his nomination, emphasizing sexual assault/character was their best/only play.

@jonathanchait than*
@jonathanchait Perhaps. I think Economics is also a field where well-heeled interests sustain academically discredited scholarship for ideological ends, in a manner that has had far graver consequences for humanity that the failures of identitarian humanities departments.
@jonathanchait I suppose that's right. If I were confident that this was the case, I probably wouldn't have mocked a center-left academic for promoting a narrative that is useful to the right.
@jonathanchait But I'm deeply skeptical that this stunt actually demonstrates what it claims to, and am alarmed by the prospect that it will be weaponized by malign rightwing actors.
@jonathanchait I listened to an interview with Jon Haidt the other day and found his arguments about the way some of the left's discourse around trauma contradicts the best practices of CBT interesting. I admired Jesse's writing on the Tuvel affair.
@jonathanchait I think leading one's readers to believe that a problem is peculiar to one political faction -- when it is actually common to many -- is mendacious, in itself, and should be avoided as a matter of principle. Anyhow, I don't object to any and all criticisms of the academic left..
@jonathanchait ...and/or, that he devotes the bulk of his critiques of academia to the intellectual failures of neoclassical economics.
@jonathanchait Perhaps this is not analogous and I have been unfair to Yascha. It is possible that he has strong evidence that the problem documented by that stunt really is peculiar to leftwing humanities departments...
@jonathanchait To have spent the fall of 2016 decrying Hillary Clinton's interventionism -- without noting that Trump also had hawkish instincts -- would have been to abet mendacious propaganda.
@jonathanchait Sure. But the point is simply that context matters. Not only for evaluating whether a criticism should be made, but how should be framed.
@jonathanchait 2) For example, one could have spent all of October 2012 excoriating Obama for the high-civilian casualty rates of his drone program. But relentlessly focusing on that failure, in that context, would threaten to obscure the threat posed by the Mitt Romney campaign.
@jonathanchait 1) I think in other contexts, you would agree that the choice of which problems one choses to emphasize -- amidst what political conditions -- is an important ethical/political question....
@jonathanchait ...then stunts which selectively spotlight their failures are performing propagandistic work for an anti-intellectual right at a time when that movement is slashing funding to higher education in many states, and fomenting popular hostility to liberal intellectuals.
@jonathanchait (My leftwing layman's view of economics profession suggests that such a phenomenon is quite prevalent there indeed.) And if it is the case that this isn't a phenomenon peculiar to leftwing humanities departments...
@jonathanchait This strikes me as plausible; I admit, this is not a subject I've researched much. I do wonder whether it is not the case that, in most disciplines, there are lower intellectual standards for work that comports with that fields dominant ideas/established orthodoxies.

@Gurdur @CathyYoung63 the use of state power to punish certain categories of political speech, and the precocity of non-tenured faculty strike me as more severe (in the first case) and pervasive (in the second) than students using physical force to shut down speech they don't like.

@sam_a_bell It's a fair point. I think it makes *more* business sense now than it did then. But the labor market was already fairly tight in October 2017, and it was already true that Amazon could potentially gain on its competitors by triggering an industry-wide spike in labor costs.
@MidwestDeplore @sam_a_bell I'm generally sympathetic to the "giant firms can achieve economies of scale that can benefit workers and consumers, so long as we have strong unions/mechanisms for collective bargaining and taxing/regulation" argument. (a.k.a the bruenig side of the bruenig-stoller debate)
@MidwestDeplore @sam_a_bell The piece does not argue that it is bad that Amazon's competitors will go out of business because they can't afford to pay their workers. It merely advances the hypothesis that Amazon's relative insensitivity to labor costs factored into Bezos's thinking.
@tullyfur Having higher wages isn't bad. I don't care much about Amazon's competition, if the end result is higher wages and well-served consumers. Am simply analyzing the motives behind Bezos's decision.
this would sure be depressing https://t.co/Tiq3JOOx4x
@PGunigantiAT I think it's good for Amazon to raise its rivals' labor costs. Just think the fact that Amazon is less sensitive to an increase in labor costs than its competitors likely factored into Bezos's decision.

@michaelbd @briebriejoy @AG_Conservative Yes, the argument that nominees for the Court who have been credibly accused of sexual assault should not throw partisan tantrums when asked to publicly respond to the allegations is indistinguishable from the argument that ppl should be tried by mobs and jailed w/o due process.
@michaelbd @briebriejoy @AG_Conservative And whatever the validity of his gripes with the Democrats on the judiciary committee, the millions of Americans concerned by the allegations did not commit any ethical violation that would deny them the right to be concerned by Ford’s claim.
@michaelbd @briebriejoy @AG_Conservative Ford reported her allegation to the Washington post in July herself, on her own volition. It is true she did not agree to go public at that time. But there is nothing illegitimate on its face, about an allegation originating from media reports
@michaelbd @briebriejoy @AG_Conservative That is such a gross misreading of what I am saying I have a hard time believing it is meant on good faith. I am not saying he needed to incriminate himself; I’m saying he had an obligation to treat those asking him to account for the allegations with basic decorum and respect
@michaelbd @briebriejoy @AG_Conservative Which is to say: he could have signaled that he understands he owes Americans who are not predisposed to believe him answers, (instead of behaving as though he is owed a Supreme Court seat, and that anyone who felt this hearing was necessary is a bitter Clinton fan)
@michaelbd @briebriejoy @AG_Conservative ...he could acknowledge that it is fair that many Americans wanted to see these allegations aired formally, and that it is entirely reasonable (even if personally tragic) that he is being called to account for them.
@michaelbd @briebriejoy @AG_Conservative Even if he knows he is innocent, he still should be capable of recognizing that reasonable ppl could look at the publicly available facts and feel concerned. And given that he is asking the public to award him a degree of power that only a small number of humans will ever possess
@michaelbd @briebriejoy @AG_Conservative The issue isn’t signaling a partisan political affiliation, but rather, projecting contempt towards anyone who is not predisposed to view reality through the conservative movemennt’s lens.
@michaelbd @briebriejoy @AG_Conservative I genuinely can't fathom how that conduct was not disqualifying unless we're stipulating that the idea that Supreme Court justices are accountable to the whole public (and not just the members of their ideological movement) is a false pretense worth dispensing with.
@michaelbd @briebriejoy @AG_Conservative What about his claim that the hearing was born of a leftwing conspiracy, fueled by sour grapes over the 2016 election, which didn't even allow for the possibility that some Americans (who do not share its unique access to the facts of the case) might find Ford's claims credible?
@michaelbd @briebriejoy @AG_Conservative You think that it isn't reasonable to expect a Supreme Court justice to understand that "all four witnesses say it didn't happen" is not an honest way of describing the fact that all four witnesses say they don't remember the party at which "it" allegedly occurred?

@plasticscandal @lrozen Right. But it takes 51 Senate votes to end the filibuster, and simple majorities in both houses (and a president's signature) to pack the court. Which is why the Supremes must safeguard their legitimacy (especially if they want to strike down major legislation in the future).
@DanielPKrouse @elkmovie @lrozen The party is also rallying behind Gillum in Florida (hillary clinton, no less). Anyhow, if you believe that these forces are unbeatable, then I don't understand why you pay attention to politics. There is no plausible path to power outside the two-party system.

They dismiss an FBI investigation as useless because it wouldn't produce a conclusion, only gather evidence -- and then whine about not having enough evidence to assess the allegations.
The lifeblood of the conservative movement is aggrieved entitlement. Graham and Kavanaugh are dousing the whole chamber in it.
Conservatives have long benefited from the fact that Democrats mistakenly regard the Supreme Court as a progressive institution because of the civil rights movement/roe/and gay marriage. Confirming an unabashed GOP partisan (who's been credibly accused of assault) will end that.
The conservative movement has a powerful interest in preserving the perceived legitimacy of the anti-majoritarian branch of government. Seems reckless to confirm a justice that half the country will see as a vengeful rapist, however he reads to the conservative base.
If they go through with confirming Kavanaugh it will have the (potentially edifying tho hazardous) effect of utterly delegitimizing the court to a wide swath of Democratic voters.
@LemieuxLGM this post is getting an alarming amount of search traffic right now

3) Anyhow, the main problem with Kavanaugh as a jurist, and NeverTrump conservatives as political actors, is that they are wedded to an anti-democratic political movement that uses racial demagogy to advance plutocracy.  https://t.co/Dn6Semr56J
2) But the most important partisan fault line in the debate over Kavanaugh has been about how thoroughly the allegations against him should be investigated, not Democrats demanding they be treated as obviously true, but the GOP insisting they be be dismissed as obviously false.
1) fwiw, I think it is highly probable that Kavanaugh did what Ford claims, but I am not certain of that. And I have sympathy for concerns about how uncorroboated allegations are adjudicated in the court of public opinion,  (albeit, a bit less for people vying for public power). https://t.co/nsn3U0YBP8

People hostile to her politics surely contributed to the subsequent scrutiny she received. But you don’t need any vast conspiracy to explain why her fabrications attracted attention.
Salazar was getting a bizarre amount of (positive) press for a State Senate candidate before the Tablet report dropped. AOC’s victory made “first-time socialist candidate runs for office in NYC” a subject of interest to national news outlets.

@MattBruenig @BernieBro69 Point of the post is simply to establish that the primary obstacle to radical action on climate isn't public opinion or human nature.

@ThorntonHall1 I disagree. I think it spotlights how fundamentally race and class shapes the conservative understanding of criminal justice.
@ThorntonHall1 And I believe that anyone who identified with the GOP for the last decades of the 20th century -- without loudly critiquing its criminal justice agenda -- has evinced a tolerance for imposing far harsher consequences on juvenile offenders than Kavanaugh is at risk of facing.
@ThorntonHall1 I addressed the flaws in Nichols argument in the piece. If Kavanaugh was a 17-year-old offender, then he is, today, a 53-year-old liar.
@ThorntonHall1 My piece argues takes the juvenile justice advocates' position https://t.co/OCXfrWm3Fy
In the U.S., juvenile drug offenders are tried as adults, 13-year-old murderers have been sentenced to life w/o parole, and teens who sext get branded as sex offenders for life.		But denying Kavanaugh a Supreme Court seat would set a dangerous precedent. 	https://t.co/Uy1Dejk7uh

@JonEHecht @EthanBWinter The one problem with Cole's theory is the mass GOP retirements, which is killing them almost as much as Trump.

@JonEHecht @EthanBWinter That said, I'm not sure Cole is entirely wrong. I've seen polls showing voters trust the GOP more than Dems to manage the economy. Cole's caucus doesn't deserve credit for a sound economic policy but it's plausible that with a more palatable president they'd get enough to survive

@briebriejoy @nhannahjones @MattWatchGundam This premise might be incorrect (I believe there is significant evidence to support the idea, though little to suggest eradicating material want would satiate white America's hunger for racial dominance entirely). But whatever it is, it is not a defense of racism.
@briebriejoy @nhannahjones @MattWatchGundam Similarly, to say that white Americans (in the aggregate) might defend their privileged place in the nation's racial hierarchy more violently in times of material scarcity than in ones of abundance is not to say that such a reaction is morally defensible.
@briebriejoy @nhannahjones @MattWatchGundam To analyze the potential causes of a sociological phenomenon is not to defend or justify it.

Hard to counter the Democrats' "we need a check on Trump" argument when top administration officials and Republican Senators are saying shit like this (even if they do follow it up with "but don't worry, Mad Dog Mattis has got this all taken care of").  https://t.co/ZUTx131jy3

@SeanMcElwee I'm still skeptical that the base recognizes the importance of procedural questions/norm-defiance. Think it will require the fearless leadership of true patriot like Michael Avenatti to make that a central issue in the 2020 primaries

But also, don't really think this kind of stuff matters much at all. And to the extent that it does, the damage is already done. Either he gets attention for being a martyr or for being the subject of a much-discussed festival appearance. He's already won.
Imo, it would be fine for the New Yorker festival to host a hostile interview with Stephen Miller, since that fascist is an active public official who would remain powerful and relevant without any media attention. Bannon invite is harder to understand.

@whstancil Sure. But I think there are good reasons to emphasize that the problem currently facing us is bigger than Trump. We might disagree on this point, but I'm not at all convinced that Trump is a bigger threat to democracy than, say, the North Carolina GOP's model of governance.
@whstancil So, it's not clear to me what's lost by raging against the dying of historical memory of what Bush wrought.
@whstancil Sure. Look, if I saw polling that said George W. Bush campaigning with Democrats against John Faso would swing votes in NY-19, and George W. Bush wanted to campaign with Democrats against John Faso in NY-19, I guess I might not complain. But that's not reality.
@whstancil I agree that people on the left (and within every other political faction) are typically overly confident that their preconceptions about how politics works/what pragmatic action looks like was actually validated by [insert emergent phenomenon] and need not be rethought.
@whstancil 2)...and that embracing the Bushies reinforces that culture of elite impunity. So if we're not going for the "giant centrist coalition," why withhold our dunks?
@whstancil Fair. But I don't think it's crazy to suggest that a decades-old culture of elite impunity (i.e. the normalization of presidents and economic elites getting away with publicly visible crimes and malfeasance) has made it somewhat easier for Republicans to abet Trump's misdeeds...
@whstancil Sure. It's insane to think all of this was inevitable. There are many terrible aspects to the Trump presidency that are clearly the idiosyncratic products of his hideous personality. If NBC gives him a better contract on the Celebrity Apprentice in 2015, we dodge several bullets.
@whstancil I do think if we define the contemporary crisis as one of the rule of law however, then joining hands with an administration that did so much to erode that concept is somewhat "problematic," as the children say.
@whstancil Anyhow, did not mean to say that I totally endorse the argument, only that I find it comprehensible.
@whstancil I think the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are a major driver of Islamophobia in the U.S. Whenever the United States has gone to war with foreign enemies, there's typically been an uptick in domestic prejudice/violence against ethnic groups popularly associated with that enemy.
@whstancil could be wrong but seems pretty straightforward to me: the lawlessness of the Bush administration (spying, torture, illegal wars, politicized investigations aimed at rationalizing voter suppression) was a constitutional crisis, which helped set the stage for Trumpsim

@SteveKl00655958 @trekonomics I disagree. I don't believe the piece ever argues that those two conflicts were morally equivalent.

@fivefifths @DunkaRuse @theshrillest @wsegad I think the most plausible path for progress on racial inequality is to campaign on universalist transfer programs, and then work into (at least some of) those policies facially-neutral distributional formulas that, in practice, deliver disproportionate aid to African-Americans.
@fivefifths @DunkaRuse @theshrillest @wsegad Reparations  polls orders-of-magnitude worse than proposals for class-based redistribution. And social scientists (and the GOP) have demonstrated that one of the best ways to diminish support for such redistribution is to paint it as a racial transfer. https://t.co/Kf5pKvcWz3 https://t.co/3yY0EC696M
