@realDonaldTrump You disgust me old smelly idiot!
@CNN He should spend the other 40% doing the same so that we won‚Äôt have to see his face
@B52Malmet I heard most of the times he would take a nap in the office. üò¥
@MSNBC Trump can‚Äôt just take orders from Putin publicly. It needs to be private. Very private.
@atrupar Being the policemen of the world is what makes America Great. If he doesn‚Äôt like it, he should resign and move somewhere else!
@HuffPost It would be a lot easier for media to make it news when Trump makes a true statement
@NPR Racism is a mental weakness. Weak people should not govern!
@MSNBC @NicolleDWallace He could stand on the 5th Ave. and shoot someone randomly and people would still love him and support him! Phenomenon!
@nytimes Sounds like Mister Trump made some moneyz
@MKopechne @KamalaHarris You need to be able to connect with people to get to the top. Sex alone won‚Äôt get you there.
@MKopechne @KamalaHarris Sex is a beautiful thing. Healthy people tend to enjoy it.
@VW_zone @tony55744 @MSNBC Check out the news once in a while
@ABC Abuse of the National Emergencies Act!
@VW_zone @tony55744 @MSNBC Sad!
@ABC Let‚Äôs face it! He doesn‚Äôt really care about any wall. It‚Äôs just a distraction while he is completing Putin‚Äôs tasks
@washingtonpost @TheRickWilson If you still support Trump, you are in need of some serious help
@VW_zone @tony55744 @MSNBC Sounds like it would take a while to enlighten you so sorry got no time for that
@NPR When Hillary said tRUmp was Putin‚Äôs puppet, he was so pissed and all I could think of was ‚Äútruth hurts‚Äù
@MSNBC As an agent working for Russian government, he is doing a really good job! Now, Russia can test missiles near the US territory!
@PhilipRucker @Lawrence Meaning Russia now can test missiles near the territory of the US!?
@JohnCleese @Lawrence I watched the whole thing LIVE. Unedited!
@realDonaldTrump Build the Wall and Cash will Fall!
@Newsweek Would be too bad for Russia!?
@MSNBC It's his prerogative to believe that his speech matters
@cnnbrk Like somebody was gonna listen to your speech
@ABC Just become a bartender or something
@WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @JesseBWatters @greggutfeld You must be russian!
