@ElizabethHeng Having lived in areas with HSR I can tell the CA HSR is a really stupid idea. Once you get to where you are going how do you get around, it is not like there is a bus or another train running every few minutes.
@Patrici48839834 I am just asking for the same treatment, let go into the country and we will go back when they are ready to hear the case. That seems fair to me and we even filed before requesting access. That 900K doesn't count those filing legally from other countries.
@Patrici48839834 Immigration papers have been filed but they are on a 9-year waiting list. what I am complaining about is the catch and release program. Illegals get caught then claim asylum and let go in the country and told to come back when their case is ready to be heard.
@ewarren Many people need those around the edges fixes, such as a wall here and a wall there. Bernie Sanders has an illegal alien on his payroll. That is a job an American citizen could have had. Where is the fairness in that? Doesn't he use E-Verify?
@AOC Is your boyfriend still on your payroll?
@tedlieu @POTUS Have you ever committed any crimes or misconducts?
@HillaryClinton Can my granddaughters come and stay with me in the US while they wait for the immigration papers to make their way through the process like many asylum seekers get to do while they wait? If not, why not? Is there any reason Asian's don't get the same benefits?
@HillaryClinton @fams2gether @ACLU @CBP Can my granddaughters come and stay with me in the US while they wait for the immigration papers to make their way through the process like many asylum seekers get to do while they wait? If not, why not? Is there any reason Asian's don't get the same benefits?
@filosofunk @ttagaris Let's have the ballots in English only!
@ttagaris How many are college students and why aren't they in class?
@FAIRImmigration @dcexaminer @SaysSimonson Another job was stolen by an illegal that an American could have had.
@starsandstripes When can the overweight serve?
@RepMarkTakano @JazzJennings__ Are the non-binary and transgender people going to have to register for the draft?
@SenatorDurbin Who are the scientists that say this? Names, please.
@BillPascrell @AOC What criminal conduct? Be specific.
@dennisrodman Dennis has a desk?
@clairlemon Do the transgender have to register for the draft?
@RepTedLieu @HouseJudiciary Can my granddaughters come and stay with me in the US while they wait for the immigration papers to make their way through the process like many asylum seekers get to do while they wait? Currently, they are on a 9-year waiting list just to have the papers reviewed.
@RepYvetteClarke @RepRoybalAllard @NydiaVelazquez Can my granddaughters come and stay with me in the US while they wait for the immigration papers to make their way through the process like many asylum seekers get to do while they wait? Currently, they are on a 9-year waiting list just to have the papers reviewed.
@AbeGreenwald Do teen transgenders have to register for the draft?
@sapiensxtinct @MartinHeinrich How about arresting illegal aliens who try to buy guns.
@SenSanders Give us your facts not "likely's."
@MattWalshBlog I am well known enough to ask who are you. If you don't believe me ask anybody who knows me.
@alyssalimp I am the type who would yell for a bag and then question them why they don't have bags at the checkout. No bell at all.
@AnnCoulter Not till my granddaughters get here.
@AOC how many years did she bartend?
@GavinNewsom Are people who come here on vacation from other countries going to be able to use our health care system without paying? If not why are you going to give benefits to illegal aliens?
@CNN What about Obama's school records?
@RepJayapal @RepJoshHarder What about people who are here visiting from other countries on vacations, are they going to be covered?
@FHSBurleson @tn_bush @NBCNews You mean he ruled equality of the sexes is unconstitutional?
@PNS_CA Groundbreaking?
@tedlieu Don't forget he is in the military and works surrounded by walls and barbed wire fences, and he if lives on the base he also surrounded by those same walls and fences and has the MPs to help patrol the area.
@WashTimes I want them to decide quickly when my granddaughters can come here. They are on a 9-year waiting list just to have their paperwork looked at. I don't need a decision for a traitor, let her stay there.
@RepLipinski No political entity, rule, or law should ever be permanent, there should always be a sunset clause, dictionary and a thesaurus attached to every piece of legislation.
@TechExecCrystal @TXCivilRights @RepJayapal My congressman's office will not return my calls, but I keep calling him. I want the same treatment an illegal gets. Catch and release then maybe go back and see what the results are.
@SenJackReed If it is so safe, tear down all the walls and fences surrounding military bases and your home and see how safe you feel then. We the public would like to have the feeling of safety also.
@SenJackReed I know a lot of Generals will say that while they are on the bases surrounded by walls and barbed wire fences. They feel safe there. When he was in Korea it was the same way. He was surrounded by walls and fences. America needs to be protected as well.
@realDonaldTrump North Korea could really make a bunch of money by opening up a bunch of ski lodges and nature trails.
@TXCivilRights @RepJayapal Can my granddaughters come and stay with me in the US while they wait for the immigration papers to make their way through the process like many asylum seekers get to do while they wait? Currently, they are on a 9-year waiting list just to have the papers reviewed.
@BernieSanders How about people taking personal responsibility for how they get and spend their money? Get only what you can afford.
@timkaine Tell that to your cohorts who say that abortion for any reason is a right for women all the way up to their due date. That came from their lips, not some twitter post.
@RepDonBeyer @HouseDemocrats @repjohnlewis @davidcicilline @RepKClark Can you sit on the floor and demand that the Wall be built to help curb illegal aliens from coming into our country?
@RyanAFournier Ban the yellow vest guy from All school grounds and make him pay for 5 NEW hats for students who want them.
@gracenapolitano It saves 9 million, but how much are we spending? I suggest that we charge visitors to the US a $10.00 National Park Fee every time they enter the US. That includes North and South Borders and everybody on Visitor Visas.
@tn_bush @NBCNews But we still do not require the women to register for the draft. Hmmm, Are the transgender required to register for the draft?
@NBCNews I want to hear from the fans and teammates how they embrace them. Maybe one or two embraces but I believe the majority does not. Are the transgender fully the gender they want to be or are they still in the "process?"
@USCIS @TheJusticeDept Again: Can my granddaughters come and stay with me in the US while they wait for the immigration papers to make their way through the process like many asylum seekers get to do while they wait? Currently, they are on a 9-year waiting list just to have the papers reviewed.
@MartinHeinrich I wish you were concerned as much about American citizens in the US being killed and injured by illegal aliens that snuck over here across the border.
@BernieSanders Minimum wage should be $5.00 an hour. It is a starting wage and NEVER was meant as a LIVING wage. If all you do is minimum wage work then that is what you will get paid. Work harder and learn more to get pay increases. We need to pay politicians $3.00 an hour max!
@RepRobinKelly @realDonaldTrump Congress has given a president the power to declare a national emergency by 50 U.S.C. 1621 and  50 U.S.C. 1622.  A declaration of an emergency allows the President to reprogram funds in the military budget.  See 33 U.S. Code § 2293 “Reprogramming during national emergencies.”
@RepJudyChu @PPFA PP was founded on the eugenics principle. They want to get rid of the "inferiors." The public should not fund them.
@RepMarkMeadows Schiff, if there is evidence, put it out there for everyone to see. So far you haven't done that. Facts, please, no talking points.
@DonaldJTrumpJr The males transferring to female and compete in women's sports earn no respect from me. The best they can do is sit on the sidelines and cheer on their team.
@DonaldJTrumpJr I was watching a program and they had the LGBTQ individuals wanting respect. Respect is earned and it is by individuals, not groups. Just because you belong to a certain group does not gain you respect, actions do.
@crinpa @USCIS Yeah, I already know but as they have the catch and release program I was hoping someone who is trying to come here legally would get the same treatment. It is a problem when most of those don't come back for their hearings and are roaming free in the US.
@CR It is the women who are demanding equality. What is good for the gander is good for the goose. Be careful what you wish for.
@USCIS Can my granddaughters come and stay with me in the US while they wait for the immigration papers to make their way through the process like many asylum seekers get to do while they wait? If not, why not? Is there any reason Asian's don't get the same benefits?
@KaroleVesnaugh @heyitspickett His wife insisted they match.
@RepDonBeyer @USAID When was the last time you spent in your own district meeting with the people who live and work there?
@TheSafestSpace Born a guy race as a guy.
@aub_kelly At least he has enough sense to know who is the better cook.
@RepKarenBass Make a law against criminals attacking people and that may help. At least when they get convicted keep them in jail. If they are illegal call ICE to come and pick them up, Another helpful suggestion.
@SarahPalinUSA What can we do for an untreated money problem? I don't have enough of it.
@CNN Since wheelchair Barbie is supposed to a teen of today then where is the power chair?
@CNN I wonder where the pregnant teenage Barbie is or the Barbie that will only fit in a Moo-moo.
@corvalues Here is my current kick: Take back America, MAGA! Equality of the sexes, women must register for the draft. No DACA, Build the Wall, Obey the Laws, Make illegal immigration a felony and English the Official Language.
@corvalues Currently, in San Francisco, they are letting illegals vote in the election for the school board only  I doubt it though.
@corvalues I cannot get ballots in Korean for my wife but the Spanish are readily available. Their excuse is that there are many Spanish speakers. Big Deal when you become an American Citizen you must pass an English test. Why have the ballots in anything other English?
@corvalues I know how you feel. I told Comcast I wanted all my in English but they said that I had to keep the Spanish Channels just don't turn to them. They are charging for having a certain amount channels but half of them are useless (actually 93%) to me. I then ask for Korean - Nope.
@DeptVetAffairs @starsandstripes Back then the burger joints were the downfall of drunken men. Congratulations.
@AOC So, AOC says she is in charge now. Have you checked with Empress Pelosi, or maybe the American Citizens you work for? You are in charge of nothing, you have a job to do and that is for the American people that elected you! You go just and easily as you came.
@HouseDemocrats Watch out, AOC says she in charge now.
@AOC Let us see the scientific data on the climate change, not the talking points but the ac5trual data that says we will lose everything in 12 years. I am still waiting for the ice age I was promised in the '60s and '70s. No talking points please, just the facts.
@corvalues When I was in Korea the former President there told his people: "We want to compete on the Global Market, Learn English."
@corvalues I went to a Golden Corral Buffet and asked a worker there where the butter was but she had to get a translator. I was in LA and had a problem with my order at a Carl's Jr. and when I asked for the manager I had to have someone translate and she did not speak English.
@corvalues My wife gets upset when she goes to other places and the people there don't speak English. She went to a Chinese Buffet restaurant and the server there did not speak English (or Korean).
@corvalues @realDonaldTrump Noi, but I translate for my wife when she needs it. Her first language is Korean and when she has a hard time I translate and it doesn't cost the taxpayer a dime.
@CNN Culturally insensitive? How can history be insensitive, it is what happened.
@darhar981 @DailyCaller Abolish ice - drink your drinks warm.
@Harlan She will probably get married and demand her husband support her.
@SonOfOurFathers @Harlan Replace that with a manual push mower and you have a go fund me for 1969.
@RealSaavedra She sounds like a Republican.
@RealSaavedra They are interviewing body doubles now. There is no way that could be Maxine Waters.
@SenSchumer @senatemajldr I guess we ought to ask some of your associates if they still think humans are causing climate change on the Sun and Mars. A side note is that having the military go one side of Guam will not cause it to flip over and sink.
@AOC If it is the truth it is hard to manipulate.
@AnnCoulter Hook, Line, Sinker.
@Alyssa_Milano Alyssa, Is there any reason you have sex on your mind all the time? "F***."
@Alyssa_Milano I have yet to find a baby who doesn't scream for one reason or another.
@phill82245 @EKofod @KimFoxxforSA @neeratanden @KamalaHarris I understand now, she found you a bed buddy like her Willie Brown, right?
@rep_stevewomack Yeah, I am sure she would have said that she was too busy to talk to you like she does to the regular Joe's who work in her town.
@RealSaavedra What BS, get over it and build the Wall!
@PrisonPlanet where are the obese models?
@attn How is going to stop criminals from buying on the street corners? Let's see, a criminal robs a house, finds a gun, sells it to a "friend" on the street corner who then uses it to rob you. Where does it end up online? It needs to be on the street level.
@Crimson_Fhang Allahu Akbar = Life is Good? Isn't Life is Good a slogan from the Korean Company LG? I never heard any employees of LG going around saying Allahu Akbar.
@SGottliebFDA Are there any other manufacturers outside the US that meet the standards we apply. If so allow them to act as a pharmacy for Americans. The competition will get the price lower and keep it low. No more collusion between manufacturers.
@RepMarthaRoby Of course, the Democrats want one of their own groups to clean out DC.
@USCIS 4 years, now get my granddaughters here. We just need a green card for now.
@RepRobinKelly @POTUS A guess is just an estimate, not a fact. We know that Walls slow people down and that is what we need a way to slow them down to get people there to protect our country. Are you going to be able to do that from your comfy seat in Illinois? I don't think so. Build the Wall!
@RepRobinKelly @POTUS It is said apprehensions are down which may be true but how many are not being apprehended? Do you know If so how do you know? Are the ones getting through calling you and letting you know? I doubt that. we really are unsure how many actually get through. we can make guesses.
@RepRobinKelly @POTUS You say not a National emergency, how about a few cat 1 hurricanes and then hit by a cat 5. would that be a national emergency? That is what is happening now. A few people trying to get over the border but now a whole group is trying to.
@RepRobinKelly @POTUS Congress has given a president the power to declare a national emergency by 50 U.S.C. 1621 and  50 U.S.C. 1622.  A declaration of an emergency allows the President to reprogram funds in the military budget.  See 33 U.S. Code § 2293 “Reprogramming during national emergencies.”
@RepRobinKelly @POTUS You are the one who is trying to fool the American people and a majority realize that. What President Trump is doing is legal and approved by Congress and allowed under the Constitution. Congress gave its permission for the President to do this back in 1976.
@RepRobinKelly @POTUS We need the Wall to control the flow of people into the country. Ask anybody on the border whether the wall help control the flow. Drones don't control the flow they just help spot them. We need control to help stop them. Once they are channeled we can then stop them.
@RepRobinKelly @POTUS Do the illegal aliens have any diseases that we need to know about, are the educated, can they need to have a basic comprehension of English. What kind of criminal background do they have? If they are trouble they can stay where they are.
@RepRobinKelly @POTUS Make it harder for illegal aliens to sneak into the country. The ladders comment is always BS so don't say that. We need to know everything about the people coming into the country. Their real names, medical, educational, criminal histories. We don't need people who lie.
@RepRobinKelly @POTUS Come live in Taxifornia and say that. My wife is an immigrant and she is getting tired of the people sneaking over when she can't even get her grandkids here. They are on a 9-year waiting list to have their paperwork LOOKED at. No more benefits for illegal aliens.
@SenatorHassan Close universities and open more trade schools.
@LucasRAcosta Wasn't Obama silent on the Islamics throwing LGBTQ people from the roof?
@andylevy Maybe they should get President Trump to host the Oscars. A better person would be Mike Rowe from the Dirty Jobs series.
@ewarren @NRA It does seem like the Congress is for sale. I believe that the NRA may be trying to do that but they are far down the line. Congress wants them to amp up the money for themselves. Congress is getting a little pricey to afford anymore except for the extremely rich.
@omriceren Who had nothing to do either? It sounds like the Journalists are saying they had nothing to do with either one. From what I saw the Journalist were the ones trying to tell everybody the way they should see things. Sounds like they were running the narrative.
@RealJamesWoods Could a hate crime be filed against Jussie? It appears he really hates conservatives and whites. He didn't even hire any whites to beat him up.
@Advoc8LikeAMom @SenBlumenthal Sorry to hear about that. I guess things have changed a lot since I lived in military housing. I  basically lived in military housing from 1954 to 1998. If we had any problems we would get hold of the housing authority and they would take care, It is a shame.
@Advoc8LikeAMom @aliciahhudson @SenBlumenthal I guess things have changed a lot since I lived in military housing. I basically lived in military housing from 1954 to 1998. If we had any problems we would get hold of the housing authority and they would take care, if not we would tell our commander and it would get solved.
@cnni Kids need or want to make money on their own including have a "lemonade: stand without the fear of government threats. I suggest limiting government threats on those age 15 and below.
@cnni At what age is it considered child labor? What if the child wants to have some work to make money for themselves? Major companies need to have an age limit on those they hire but local people need to be able to hire a kid if they want without government interference.
@RepRobinKelly Please explain what "rights" are being attacked by the administration. everybody yells about it but it is never explained, please explain.
@BreitbartNews When was the last time Illinois audited their voter rolls? If they can audit gun owners then they can audit voter rolls at the same time.
@RepTedDeutch What would say if there is nothing to dig up. Maybe Mueller has been putting conjectures into place instead of facts. What if he did this.. or maybe he could have done that... where does it end? End it now and make a decision that is based on facts.
@SenWarren Why do other people have to pay for the fun you had? There is right in the constitution for childcare. It is your responsibility when you decide to have a child. Nobody else should have to pay for them. we need to get back to personal responsibility.
@ChrisMurphyCT I did not hear that businesses were guaranteeing wage increases, I did hear it was a possibility. As far as tax increases did you adjust your W4 withholdings to account for the differences in taxation?
@AkinSawyerr Wrong, not everybody is talented.
@realDonaldTrump Opportunity is there, talent is not.
@w_terrence Can you ask President Trump to let me have my grandkids here while they wait for their paperwork to be completed for immigration? Currently, they are on a 9-year wait just to have the paperwork reviewed. They have catch and release on the border, how about sign and release?
@AGBecerra @realDonaldTrump Potty patrols in Sf, sanctuary cities, releasing thousands of prisoners before their time, sleeping their way to the top. Yeah, sure, respect for the law.
@w_terrence @JussieSmollett Everybody forgets what Jussie's job is. He is an actor in which the job calls for being able to lie convincingly. I think he is doing it quite well at the moment but he forgot that he is not making a movie at the moment. This is real life.
@CNN Please don't show that cabbage to my wife. I will never make it through the Kimchi that she would make with it.
@JimmyPrinceton Do you think 45 targeted him or did he try to target 45?
@aliciahhudson @SenBlumenthal @Advoc8LikeAMom I have not lived in military housing for a while now and from the sounds of things, it has really gotten bad. Do you have any idea when things started to go downhill? Was it in Private or Military housing that made you sick? On or off base?
@Advoc8LikeAMom @SenBlumenthal I have not lived in military housing for a while now and from the sounds of things, it has really gotten bad. Do you have any idea when things started to go downhill? Was it in Private or Military housing that made you sick? On or off base?
@SarahPalinUSA I want to quit the NFL, Can I get money for quitting also?
@JKearney253 @RepJayapal I am having fun with this. I am watching Live PD, doing twitter and working on an excel spreadsheet while I do this. My duty is to let people know how I feel and if you are 1 them (because you tweeted me) then so be it.
@JKearney253 @RepJayapal Ah, the threat now, good iI have really your goat this time. You have used God and Jesus and don't forget tomorrow is Sunday. Are we going to see you at church? Again with the personal attacks, love it. Please explain how it is untrue, or it just you don't like to explain things?
@JKearney253 @RepJayapal It definitely apparent when someone says what you don't like you have to try and attack personally. Not a good sign of a decent conversation. I do accomplish a lot but it isn't always what everyone likes. There are always differences of opinions and thoughts.
@JKearney253 @RepJayapal I scream into the void and guess what, you are listening. You think your the only one who reads reports and meets with your rep but guess what you are not. Again you have started in with the personal attacks, this time about immaturity and ignorance.
@JKearney253 @RepJayapal Even for you, I would suggest even if they are not your rep let them know how you feel, if you don't they will never know and when we let them know they will realize they are being watched and hopefully do the right thing (whatever that might be) keep them on their toes.
@JKearney253 @RepJayapal She may be in your district but she is making decisions that affect the whole nation so it is my duty to let her know how I feel. You have no idea how much my rep hears from me. But while I am trying to work with them I will also let others know.
@JKearney253 @RepJayapal What would you suggest for protecting the border to protect us from people crossing illegally? Do you know any countries that have walls to protect their borders? The one thing about the wall is that you spend once on it and it stays there, you don't have to keep spending money.
@JKearney253 @RepJayapal The wall, If walls are a waste of money then why do we have them around prisons, actors houses, our schools, and even Disneyland. Any reason that you can explain why you would want me off twitter? Is it because I don't think like you?
@JKearney253 @RepJayapal I will troll any rep that isn't doing their job. As an American, it is my right and my duty to let them know how I feel. What is my hated and what bigotry are you talking about? I have not said anything personal about you but you want to call me bigoted.
@JKearney253 @RepJayapal When illegal aliens go down the line moves faster. So yes build the Wall. There is a hundred reason we need to protect our borders and one of them is to know who is coming into the country and what diseases or criminal activity they have been doing. Many more reasons.
@JKearney253 @RepJayapal I am trying to get my grandkids here but since the immigration standards are on a quota basis people from other countries are held back until the quotas level out. My grandkids are on a 9-year waiting list just to have the paperwork looked at.
@JKearney253 @RepJayapal Others have there parents or grandparents who earned the money to give to them. If your earn money wouldn't you want you children to benefit from or would you just throw them out on the street and tell them to get it from somebody else. Yes, priorities.
@JKearney253 @RepJayapal What corporate crooks are taking money from your wallet? Was that money yours to begin with. Income inequality comes from people who really don't want to work hard enough to earn. Look at the former CEO of Starbucks for that.
@JKearney253 @RepJayapal that figures you can throw it out there but will not back it up. I have checked and Mexican immigration (Legal) is down but there are a lot of people showing up from other countries attempting to sneak across. Thanks for throwing it out there.
@JKearney253 @RepJayapal One thing you might check on is how many of the illegal aliens check in to let us know that they have crossed the border? So far I have not found any place that keeps a record of the illegal aliens that have verified they have crossed the border. Let me know if you can find that.
@JKearney253 @RepJayapal Keep on believing that but have you personally talked to any of the CBP on the border. I have and their story is not that. Please give me links to your facts.
@Bomb4321Cherry Smart dog reading a Korean newspaper.
@AOC @guardian And Seattle is getting a lot of snow and California is getting record rains.
@Jadesreflection There must ba lot of snow there because I am getting that comment from a lot of people in WA.
@Jadesreflection Do you just let people waltz into your house?
@JKearney253 @RepJayapal Do you let unknown people just waltz into your house?
@realDonaldTrump Can my granddaughters come and stay with me in the US while they wait for the immigration papers to make their way through the process like many asylum seekers get to do while they wait? If not, why not? Is there any reason Asian's don't get the same benefits?
@JKearney253 @RepJayapal I hope you asking for 320 Million American People and not the 20 plus million illegal aliens. I also believe they all seem to be in Taxifornia. We don't need unknown people sneaking over our borders. We don't need them killing our citizens.
@TimOBrien Why is Rep Omar on the Foreign Affairs committee?
@RepJayapal If you the DemonRats had done your job to protect the American people then President Trump would not have to have declared a National Emergency. Since you did not do your job President Trump had to declare a National Emergency. Shame on You!
@GKeile How come she gets a pass but I can't get my grandkids here? ICE please check into this one, she is not what we want as an immigrant. We want people who want to be here and to assimilate into the American culture.
@cvpayne @FoxNews Border apprehensions low, ok, I will give you that. How many people crossed the border illegally? Did each one of them log their crossing in somewhere? If so where? How do we know exactly how many people snuck in? Give me exact numbers, not guesses. How many did not get caught?
@SEIU521 Is the money the companies earn your money? How about the unions cutting back on their wages to pay for childcare? Maybe have the unions take the money that is spent on buying politicians to pay for the childcare?
@SeerSnively @RepHuffman Walls are used to keep people out.
@SeerSnively @RepHuffman Why are there walls around prisons?
@AOC He didn't need to do this is a correct statement, but since Congress isn't doing their job and protecting America he had to do it. Stop paying your boyfriend and start working on protecting the American citizens.
@RepBillFoster And there is no crime in South Chicago. I understand Mr. Ostrich.
@RealJamesWoods I did not hear anything from the right against him. All I ever heard about him was from him. He was the one saying anything about the right. What about his 2 Nigerian friends?
@washingtonpost Isn't that what Kamala Harris did with Willie Brown?
@RepJudyChu Do you love illegal aliens, if so why? Do you trust illegal aliens, if so why? do you love MS-13? if so why? Do you love illegal drugs? If so why? Please explain your reasons.
@RepHuffman Shotguns can take down drones, but I have yet to see a shotgun take down a medieval wall. Maybe a large cannon but not a shotgun.
@RepTedDeutch The military was depleted during the Obama administration, not the Trump administration. Part of the militaries role is in the defense of the homeland. If it takes money from some areas of the military then so be it. It falls back to the Demoncrats for not funding the wall.
@USCIS Can my granddaughters come and stay with me in the US while they wait for the immigration papers to make their way through the process like many asylum seekers get to do while they wait? If not, why not? Is there any reason Asian's don't get the same benefits?
@JacksonLeeTX18 @HouseJudiciary @HomelandDems I am sorely disappointed with every Demoncrat that pushed for this bill. we need a wall to protect the nation, where are you on the protection of the nation? If you don't want a wall then demand that Disneyland gets rid of its walls.
@JacksonLeeTX18 @HouseJudiciary @HomelandDems You site the rule of law! What about the illegal aliens that don't abide by our laws? Are you going to try and stop them?
@Park10A @RyanGirdusky How did you get to talk to them, all I get are their staff?
@annrovetto @washingtonpost Is it your money?
@USCIS   Can my granddaughters come and stay with me in the US while they wait for the immigration papers to make their way through the process like many asylum seekers get to do while they wait? Currently, they are on a 9-year waiting list just to have the papers reviewed.
@washingtonpost That is good to see. I would suggest Fresno in Taxifornia but they would have to deal with the so-called Taxifornia Government. Go to someplace that would appreciate them like Nebraska, Texas or Oklahoma. Stay away from New York and Taxifornia.
@IngrahamAngle Can my granddaughters come and stay with me in the US while they wait for the immigration papers to make their way through the process like many asylum seekers get to do while they wait? Currently, they are on a 9-year waiting list just to have the papers reviewed.
@CNN If an illegal alien commits a crime wouldn't the politicians of the state be held liable for their failure to have the laws enforced?
@RepCardenas No, The best person for the job should be the one hired. If you are good in the arts and that is what they need then you get hired. No more you get the job because you are this or that. Do you qualify for the job?
@SenatorMenendez Do you have a list of all the American Citizens killed by illegal aliens in our country? If not, why not? How many illegal aliens used guns to kill American Citizens? How many of the illegal aliens were not supposed to be in the country? Answers, we need answers! Build The Wall!
@RepRobinKelly Do the American citizens have to pay for healthcare for illegal aliens?
@SarahPalinUSA Is AOC's Apartment a green apartment?
@CNN We need to have the FBI investigate Demoncrats why they don't want to protect American Citizens.
@WashTimes We need more speeches from people like the Chick-fil-A and even the Hobby Lobby people. We have to listen to people like rep Omar and she is about as religious as you get. She has even had Congress change its rules to accommodate her. No Way. Take Back America!
@RepDonBeyer @RepRoKhanna Did you vote to support the defense of America?
@JesseKellyDC Give that and we will see if you are still on twitter and the 15th.
@RepTedDeutch Are you getting rid of Omar?
@marklevinshow We need to go back and do what people wanted. We get yelled out about separation of church and state. we then change our rules in Congress to allow religious headwear? Where is the separation? We don't allow coaches to say a prayer on a football field? Fairness!
@washingtonpost She made a mistake? No, the people made a mistake electing her!
@cvpayne Liberal don't want to "kill" anyone no matter how much they deserve it. The Democrats probably would have sent Hitler to a country club prison.
@katiet121 She really gives crappy people a bad name. I think I would have just stood and walked out saying let me know when you find a worthwhile politician to talk to. She was a waste of time that she had.
@IlhanMN What are you going to do, implode? Yak, Yak, Yak, Yak,Yak, Yak,Yak, Yak,Yak, Yak,Yak, Yak,Yak, Yak,Yak, Yak,Yak, Yak,Yak, Yak,Yak, Yak,Yak, Yak,Yak, Yak,Yak, Yak,Yak, Yak,Yak, Yak,Yak, Yak,Yak, Yak,Yak, Yak,Yak, Yak,Yak, Yak, Go Home.
@IlhanMN Sounds like she-goat.
@GrayForAssembly I am right more worried about California's Security and safety. We are also be told we are going to have to pay for illegal aliens and we cannot even get our family over here. I do not want to pay for any illegal alien no matter what! Get my granddaughters here!
@TheDemocrats What is Galentine's Day? I think we ought to go with the Asian way. One a Red Valentines day where the men take care of the women and a White Valentines day where the women take care of the men.
@washingtonpost Explain how President Trump trafficked in hate his entire life. Rep Omar has o[penly denounced Isreal as a hateful people. She should have never been put on any committee involving foreign policy.
@marklevinshow I don't want health care for illegal aliens. They are not honest with us so we don't need to support them. They do not abide by our laws, they cost us more money all the time. They are a drain on society. They make our children less educated. They take up room in our schools.
@washingtonpost Congress has given a president the power to declare a national emergency by 50 U.S.C. 1621 and  50 U.S.C. 1622.  A declaration of an emergency allows the President to reprogram funds in the military budget.  See 33 U.S. Code § 2293 “Reprogramming during national emergencies.”
@SenSanders Jealousy raises its ugly head, again.
@BreakingNLive Finally what they were in my high school in the '60s. The ice age is coming!
@RepBonamici Equal pay for equal work. What about women who employments standards are lower for them but they want the same pay? The military has a lower physical requirement for women than men and they still get the same pay. Why not higher pay for a higher standard?
@fresbthereal @HillaryClinton @IndivisibleTeam If women truly want equality then they need to step up and take responsibility for their actions. It starts out with the women being required to register for the draft with the same penalties that men have. How many women really want equality.
@fresbthereal @HillaryClinton @IndivisibleTeam In many jobs, they apply for the same position but the requirements are different. There is also the attitude of men are the head of the household and are told to "man up." watching many of the police shows how many times is the man automatically assumed to have caused trouble?
@fresbthereal @HillaryClinton @IndivisibleTeam That is the problem, it depends on who is doing the report. Numbers can be crunched any way you like. That is one reason I am looking for Job by job and task by task description. there are many jobs with the same title but what is required between man and woman can be different.
@Caveran17 @SenBlumenthal I was in family housing in Japa and military housing in Korean and Japan. My tent in Vietnam was cleaner than that picture. There are some old barracks at Castle AFB, Atwater, CA that may be getting in that condition but it has been closed for many years.
@fresbthereal @HillaryClinton @IndivisibleTeam Are they job for job and task for task? Do the men have the same requirements that the women have? The military does NOT hold the women to the same physical requirements that the men have. Why do women not have to sign up for the draft? Men have to or lost any federal benefits.
@HillaryClinton @IndivisibleTeam I would love to see a pay comparison that does it job for job and task for task. People also have a right to negotiate their pay. Is that taken into account? Why are Asian women paid higher than what women? where is the list for Asian, Black, and Hispanic men?
@SenBlumenthal Please explain where this picture is from. When was it taken? I am a military brat and that was never any living conditions I saw, even overseas. Fake News. I get it now, you are hedging your bets just in case the President tries to move money around for the wall. Shame on you.
@Richard41670717 @torytho Never heard any of his songs nor anything about him till the story came out. There are many others that get arrested for overstaying their visa. Just because he is a singer doesn't exempt him from the laws.
@JesseKellyDC And AOC is calling for more debt.
@delmoi 1. He overstayed his non-immigrant visa. He came over as a teenager. 2. He is a convicted felon (Drug Charges - 2014). In either case, he should be deported and the cage he was kept in is traditionally called a jail cell in America.
@nytimes I wonder who they are harassing now? Men need protection from them.
@chuckwoolery Can we sue each illegal alien for breaking into our country and costing us extra in our schools and medical facilities? They cost us more by not obeying our laws and taking jobs from American citizens and other legal immigrants.
@RepJudyChu Can we get some Nuclear Power Plants in Taxifornia? Nuclear Power is clean and safe when operated correctly.
@WashTimes That is what smoking gets you, fuzzy memories. Check with Willie and see if she was smoking while in bed with him.
@SenKevinCramer Can my granddaughters come and stay with me in the US while they wait for the immigration papers to make their way through the process like many "asylum" seekers get to do while they wait? If not, why not? Where is the fairness?
@TheDemocrats Have the conditions for the TPS ended? If so so then give them one-year to go back or make other arrangements. The T is for Temporary, not permanent. They need to get over it and start their move.
@HillaryClinton It doesn't matter anymore but it seems like teenage girls are getting us all into trouble. Men have where to go anymore. We are being held hostage by teenage girls. We can't even run our cars now without teenage girls trying to stop them. Then they want to go to the mall.
@chuckwoolery Empress Pelosi needs to resign over the Ralph Northam's blackface photo since she is his boss!
@donsoroka2011 @SenatorMenendez @RepTedDeutch @ChrisMurphyCT @SenBlumenthal @repdinatitus Godwin's law at its finest.
@mooretabithia31 @SenatorMenendez @RepTedDeutch @ChrisMurphyCT @SenBlumenthal @repdinatitus Here is something for your perusal: https://t.co/YCNNbSkh6h
@donsoroka2011 @SenatorMenendez @RepTedDeutch @ChrisMurphyCT @SenBlumenthal @repdinatitus And this is relevant how?
@mooretabithia31 @SenatorMenendez @RepTedDeutch @ChrisMurphyCT @SenBlumenthal @repdinatitus What racist?
@FresnoBee How many careless drivers go to jail for all the children they have killed? How many careless parents go to jail when their kids get into poisons? How many people go to jail when a child drowns in a backyard pool? The answer is always the same - Not always.
@SenatorMenendez @RepTedDeutch @ChrisMurphyCT @SenBlumenthal @repdinatitus Keep American Safe ought to be for building the wall and getting illegal aliens out of here. We don't know who the illegals are, they take jobs from Americans who are looking for jobs, They take up room in our schools and cost us more money every day they are here.
@washingtonpost If making a profit is so bad then why are you charging to look at the links in the tweets you post? If profit is so bad then make it all free like AOC says.
@SenSchumer No more donating your money, cut it completely without recompense for the shutdown period. Also, cut the expenses for all Congresses offices. Make the shutdown be felt by Congress as well as TSA, CBP and the Coast Guard. They need to work harder and listen to the AMERICAN people!
@SenSchumer Cut Congresses pay during the shutdown. Take back America, MAGA! Equality of the sexes, women must register for the draft. Fund the Wall of the seas, the Coast Guard! No DACA, Build the Wall, Obey the Laws, Make illegal immigration a felony and English the Official Language.
@SenSanders Most of the people who want the free stuff know they would never amount to much if they were paid what they are worth. Now if they could take their talking abilities and put it in book form and sell it as fantasy they might get something for them.
@SenSanders We should go back to paying people what they are worth. Poor Bernie couldn't even survive in a commune without getting kicked out. How much are willing to pay him? Who would get more in pay: Bernie or AOC? At least AOC can somewhat dance.
@SenSanders Minimum wage is a starting wage, idiot. You start there and work up. If we start out at the top there is no incentive to get better. The minimum wage was also for those going to school, part-time jobs and Friday night date money. It never was intended to live on.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Was she in the arms of Willie Brown at that time?
@ReezieReen @CNN I don't care what Fox News tells him as long as MSNBC and CNN don't tell him. He should listen to the people and get the wall built.
@CNN i do not see where this is much of a compromise. Maybe the President should go ahead and let another shutdown happen. At least this time we see it coming and are better prepared for it. The DemonRats don't care about the American public at all. They just want their power.
@AOC @RevJJackson Jesse Jackson has no stand on the moral center.
@RepKClark @washingtonpost @partlowj @NickMiroff @Fahrenthold Why are people who put in their paperwork being processed after a week or two of waiting but there are those who are a 9-year waiting list just to have their papers reviewed? No more cutting in line.
@RepKClark @washingtonpost @partlowj @NickMiroff @Fahrenthold Those wanting to come in legally are thrown to the side. Can my granddaughters come and stay with me in the US while they wait for the immigration papers to make their way through the process like many asylum seekers get to do while they wait? My Grandkids are on a 9-year list.
@MistresofCitrus @delmoi Him, and they are 4 and 7
@RepZoeLofgren I am still waiting to get my granddaughters here. They are doing it legally. There is no way on this earth this guy is better than my granddaughters. If they have to wait, so does he.
@RepZoeLofgren I hope he gets the equal treatment that any other illegal alien gets. Money should not make any difference of his flouting of our laws. Equal treatment in the eyes of the law is all there should be. Flight risk, no flight risk still an illegal alien.
@USCIS what changed?
@USCIS @librarycongress Can my granddaughters come and stay with me in the US while they wait for the immigration papers to make their way through the process like many asylum seekers get to do while they wait? Currently, they are on a 9-year waiting list just to have the papers reviewed.
@jimgeraghty White Chicks
@DonaldJTrumpJr Can we get the results of the universal background check on Kamala Harris?
@washingtonpost I guess when you clear the rolls of the deceased that is called voter suppression. If there is any question about a voter it needs to be checked. Call it what you want but only American citizens can vote. If there is a problem you can always on a provisional ballot.
@washingtonpost Grandma should have known better. Old enough to understand you don't help commit crimes. Snowflakes also need to be held to the same standards. We need to get back to personal responsibility and uphold our laws.
@WashTimes And a movie caused it.
@squattchie @AOC @YouTube AOC's new green ambulance https://t.co/OIllkuoesa
@thom962 @RealJamesWoods Along with that here is a picture of AOC's new green ambulance. https://t.co/iRLMW3rA2p
@NormaJTorres If you don't understand the minimum wage there is no real way to make you understand.
@CNN @KayleeHartung So far they are just allegations. I thought that in America there is a presumption of innocence until PROVEN guilty. I don't care what color, political party, religion or anything else about the accused, just whether they are guilty or not. Allegations are not proof.
@RepDonaldPayne @RepEscobar Can my granddaughters come and stay with me in the US while they wait for the immigration papers to make their way through the process like many asylum seekers get to do while they wait? If not, why not? Is there any reason Asian's don't get the same benefits?
@SenGillibrand Since women control their own bodies and men have no say in the matter, then no more child support or alimony.
@charliekirk11 Why would they call for any investigations, it is obvious that the DemonRats are experiencing TDS.
@AmericanLegion If anybody has any influence over the VA please ask them to hire more Doctors that are Native English speakers. When a person is sick they want to talk to somebody who understands them. I would also like to have an annual physical without being asked: "Why?"
@repbenraylujan Can you help get my granddaughters here while they wait for their paperwork to get looked at? Currently, they are on a 9-year waiting list just to have the papers looked at. Can you help?
@WashTimes Call the CDC, TDS is sweeping the demonRats ranks. They need to be quarantined before it spreads too far.
@WashTimes Wow! DemonRats do something wrong and it is Presidents Trump's fault. He must have a power that nobody has ever had before. Making people do things 30 years ago that were mean. I guess that DemonRats can never do anything wrong including founding the KKK.
@RealErinCruz @KamalaHarris It is hard to kick someone who is already laying down. She needs to stand up and leave the room. Harris is a liar and cheater, to begin with. She should not hold her head high but keep it bowed for shame.
@AOC I suggest Amazon move to any other states other than New York or Taxifornia. Nebraska seems like it would be a good place to move to. People like AOC would just tax Amazon to death and give the money to the low lives that DON'T wants to work.  AOC is not on the Climate Committee.
@chuckwoolery That look is disturbing. What has she been taking?
@BreitbartNews Can my granddaughters come and stay with me in the US while they wait for the immigration papers to make their way through the process like many asylum seekers get to do while they wait? If not, why not? Asians (Native Americans) were here first.
@SarahPalinUSA Can my granddaughters come and stay with me in the US while they wait for the immigration papers to make their way through the process like many asylum seekers get to do while they wait? If not, why not? Is there any reason Asian's don't get the same benefits?
@GavinNewsom Do you know why it has sunk? Build more water storage.
@kimguilfoyle Can my granddaughters come and stay with me in the US while they wait for the immigration papers to make their way through the process like many asylum seekers get to do while they wait? Currently, they are on a 9-year waiting list just to have the papers reviewed.
@MarkSKrikorian Can my granddaughters come and stay with me in the US while they wait for the immigration papers to make their way through the process like many asylum seekers get to do while they wait? Currently, they are on a 9-year waiting list just to have the papers reviewed.
@CaucusOnClimate @USRepKCastor @repbenraylujan @RepBonamici @RepBrownley @RepHuffman House climate committee? Is there something wrong with their HVAC?
@KarenGoodrich14 @SenWarren @RepAOC @SenMarkey Yep, but maybe soylent GREEN is people!
@ChristinaKMJ My blood sugar just jumped 50 points by looking at this tweet.
@HouseGOP Soylent Green is people!!!!!
@SenWarren @RepAOC @SenMarkey Explain what this "Green New Deal" is Are they going to redo all the greens on every golf course in the world or just in the US. Could it be they are going to make the dollar bill with just different shades of green? maybe we are going to be required to eat more green vegetables.
@MEPFuller And what does this have to do with anything? I have seen grown men wearing a Superman logo so a t-shirt with "We're the heroes of the future" on a 2-year-old. There is nothing wrong with that. More kids need to have fun things to wear.
@RepYvetteClarke @EnergyCommerce The other thing is what does the Committee on Energy and Commerce have to do with the border? How are they going to hold President Trump accountable? Get real and do your job. Serve the American people!
@RepYvetteClarke @EnergyCommerce Take back America, MAGA!  No DACA, Build the Wall, Obey the Laws, Make illegal immigration a felony and English the Official Language.
@RepYvetteClarke @EnergyCommerce To avoid this from happening at all the people who are trying to come into the country need to do it legally and those doing it legally need to make sure that there is no warrant for their arrest, both here and in any country they have been.
@RepYvetteClarke @EnergyCommerce If people don't commit crimes then the families will not be split up. Families and not split up on a whim. The parents are sent to jail through their own actions and we do not send whole families to jail.
@RepYvetteClarke @EnergyCommerce We need to hold the lawmakers accountable for passing such laws. If you don't like the laws then why have them. We zero tolerance to regain control of the border.
@BreitbartNews Who are you to demand anything? I can't get my granddaughters here yet so why should an illegal alien be allowed to stay in our country? It is not his country to say what the rules are. He could have followed the laws just like millions of others have, he is not that special.
@JesseKellyDC We only had one car. My dad was gone at times serving in the military and in war zones. I remember doing duck and cover drills in school.
@GavinNewsom Please explain how he is trying to deny coverage of those illnesses that you listed. No suppositions just the facts.
@NPWF We can increase it but let's do away with some of the perks so it will be revenue neutral.
@stevenportnoy Not strange, I think she may have been waiting to get in one more dig against him and he took it away from her.
@NydiaVelazquez @realDonaldTrump Take back America, MAGA! Equality of the sexes, women must register for the draft. No DACA, Build the Wall, Obey the Laws, Make illegal immigration a felony and English the Official Language.
@SenJeffMerkley Take back America, MAGA! Equality of the sexes, women must register for the draft. No DACA, Build the Wall, Obey the Laws, Make illegal immigration a felony and English the Official Language.
@WhipClyburn Complete BS.   Congress has given a president the power to declare a national emergency by 50 U.S.C. 1621 and  50 U.S.C. 1622.  A declaration of an emergency allows the President to reprogram funds in the military budget.  See 33 U.S. Code § 2293
@seanhannity Forget it. I didn't hear what she said, my TV was off.
@cnni I still want to know if that is a pulse engine.
@SenFeinstein Did you compare that to Obmams trips including his wife's trips? What about the booze for Empress Nancy? Is the high amount due to the increase in the minimum wage? How much did your hubby make on tips from you? Come on, full disclosure.
@Refinery29 @landonpeoples @RepLoisFrankel I thought it was because they finally learned how to use bleach correctly in their laundry. You know how that hard that is for some people.
@AOC AOC:   21 Savage arrested, BFG, He is illegal. : Can my granddaughters come and stay with me in the US while they wait for the immigration papers to make their way through the process like many asylum seekers get to do while they wait? If not, why not?
@USCIS I want to talk to a real live person at USCIS but am unable to. I want to get my granddaughters over here to wait for their paperwork to go through just like those coming from Mexico. They can stay with me while they wait &amp; then at least you will know where they are. Talk to me!
@WashTimes What film premiere?
@washingtonpost I hope President Trump has to pay $0.00. It should be the God-given right and duty of every American citizen to pay the least amount they can in taxes. The government needs to learn to work on its own with less and less each year as we do.
@AMike4761 IS the Pope a convert? If he is what is he a convert to?
@bobbyjoeybilly @SteveStanicki @SenStabenow It is a bit of a problem trying to find out exactly what emergencies have been declared. It seems like most of them have been against other countries. Anyway something to check out: https://t.co/HICp8ZzVW9
@bobbyjoeybilly @SteveStanicki @SenStabenow It took until 1/14/2016, just before President was sworn in. Obama did not want to have anyone say he didn't declare it an emergency because we know President Trump would have done it. It is upsetting it takes so long for an emergency to be declared in the US.
@karenknitssocks @SenStabenow it is not an end-run around Congress because gave him the authority to do it. It is their fault it has to be done and it is completely legal according to the congressional rules.
@TheCaitlinRose I didn't make myself clear and sorry about that. I was talking about the survivors of those who have been killed by illegal aliens who have snuck into our country. Those like the wife and child of the policeman who was killed by the illegal alien in Newman, CA. Talking to AOC.
@TheCaitlinRose What about the survivors of murder by illegal aliens?
@gjvanman @karenknitssocks @SenStabenow Karen, How many illegal aliens do you have working on your farm in Michigan? If you have any why don't you replace them with American Citizens or at least somebody with a green card? How much are you paying them? We need to know who is coming into the country.
@Fightfor15LA @EdLaborCmte Pay what they are worth wage!
@JacksonLeeTX18 Did you find out WHY was her child taken away? Rash jumps do nothing for finding out what caused it. What is being Hispanic got to do with anything? If you think it is racist follow this link: https://t.co/YCNNbSkh6h
@RepTedLieu @realDonaldTrump You can start the cleanup by resigning.
@SenSchumer Congress has given a president the power to declare a national emergency  by 50 U.S.C. 1621 and  50 U.S.C. 1622.  A declaration of an emergency  allows the President to reprogram funds in the military budget.  See 33  U.S. Code § 2293 “Reprogramming during national emergencies.”

@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Congress has given a president the power to declare a national emergency by 50 U.S.C. 1621 and  50 U.S.C. 1622.  A declaration of an emergency allows the President to reprogram funds in the military budget.  See 33 U.S. Code § 2293 “Reprogramming during national emergencies.”
@AOC Their parents worked hard for children. Are you against parent working hard for their children? Is there any reason why you are? How much money did you get while working at a bar? Shouldn't you have given away free drinks from your pay?
@SteveStanicki @SenStabenow Whew, your turn.
@SteveStanicki @SenStabenow President Trump has pushed the Wall as far as he can now it is time to act and Empress nancy will not give any money for the Wall. The military will now suffer because of Empress Nancy. Nancy doesn't give a crap about the American country.
@SteveStanicki @SenStabenow We have the same problem with Empress Nancy and President Trump. The military needs item to keep the planes flying and other materials. We need the border wall to help keep us safe and secure. nancy wants no wall but just technology to make it look good.
@SteveStanicki @SenStabenow Now since she won't give you any money you have to take the savings and spend it on the car instead of the new suit. Your wife didn't want to work with you to help your job but she did want to make herself look good. Oh, that makeup.
@SteveStanicki @SenStabenow Which do you do first? Get a new suit or fix the car? The new suit would be nice but need the car to get back and forth. You keep driving the car hoping you can stretch out the problems hoping your wife will give you the money. the car is now lurching down the road.
@SteveStanicki @SenStabenow Not enough characters to do everything in one tweet. Funding source: wife and your job. Problem car needs a new transmission and you need a new suit for work. Which one first? you try to get the wife to give some money but she won't, she wants her makeup.
@SteveStanicki @SenStabenow We need the money for the military but he is being forced to use it instead of a separate funding source. That is like you need money for some new clothes but your car needs repair. It is running but it will quit shortly. New clothes or fix the car? Your wife won't give any money
@SenWarren I have gone a lot longer than that without a check but you don't invite me to SOTU Address. Where is my invitation? It is the DemonRats who are using Federal Workers as bargaining chips. Build the Wall!
@GOP Congress has given a president the power to declare a national emergency  by 50 U.S.C. 1621 and  50 U.S.C. 1622.  A declaration of an emergency  allows the President to reprogram funds in the military budget.  See 33  U.S. Code § 2293 “Reprogramming during national emergencies.”

@SebGorka They want total care for illegal aliens and nothing for American infants and veterans.
@TheDemocrats @staceyabrams Congress has given a president the power to declare a national emergency  by 50 U.S.C. 1621 and  50 U.S.C. 1622.  A declaration of an emergency  allows the President to reprogram funds in the military budget.  See 33  U.S. Code § 2293 “Reprogramming during national emergencies.”

@SenStabenow Congress has given a president the power to declare a national emergency by 50 U.S.C. 1621 and  50 U.S.C. 1622.  A declaration of an emergency allows the President to reprogram funds in the military budget.  See 33 U.S. Code § 2293 “Reprogramming during national emergencies.”
@SenStabenow You are completely wrong Congress has given a president the power to declare a national emergency by 50 U.S.C. 1621 and  50 U.S.C. 1622.  A declaration of an emergency allows the President to reprogram funds in the military budget.  See 33 U.S. Code § 2293. Learn your own rules.
@chuckwoolery Yet, they want illegal aliens to get total care. To hell with American infants and veterans. DemonRats are irresponsible. How can any veteran support them? I understand Generals because they like to rule but the rest of us, we would like to get and keep what we work for.
@washingtonpost Can my granddaughters come and stay with me in the US while they wait for the immigration papers to make their way through the process like many asylum seekers get to do while they wait? Why did 21 Savage get to stay here so long illegally and even in the public spotlight?
@AOC @staceyabrams Another embarrassment for the DemonRats.
@abigailtracy @RepCummings @AOC @RepAOC What did AOC do as a bartender? How much did she earn in tips? Did she tease and humiliate men? Did she flirt with the men? Did she get their permission first to flirt with them? What kind of bar was it?
@Patrici15767099 Out curiosity what do you think drinking the Kool-Aid means?
@CAL_FIRE It is Lunar New years not just for the Chinese. There are many nationalities that celebrate the Lunar New Year.
@washingtonpost According to the DemonRats, you thought about it, therefore, you are a racist even though it was in the past and was just a thought. Oh yeah, you are white.
@USCIS Can my granddaughters come &amp; stay with me in the US while they wait for the immigration papers to make their way through the process like many asylum seekers get to do while they wait? If not, why not? Who can we talk to about this? My Congressman says there is nothing he can do.
@rez512 @AOC Kind of nice but she sure has a swelled head.
@AOC What is the Golden Rule you abide by?	Is it: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you?	Or is it: Do unto others before they do unto you?	I try to go with the first one, but I notice most politicians go with number 2.
@w_terrence https://t.co/dUoK1ePtKS	  https://t.co/rtTLPyIVrr	  Items for your perusal.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Will the real Ted Lieu please tweet. We are getting tired of his lackeys trying to indoctrinate the people as if we are sheep. we want the real ted to step forward.
@kevinthedog_og @RubenRadical99 @ICEgov But don't forget the leaves are green.
@ICEgov Another reason for the wall! Keep up the good work ICE.
@SenSanders I think AOC ought to give the Democrats response to the SOTUS.
@FAIRImmigration Are they vetted?
@LWPHarvard @joekennedy Now you say climate change is racist? What yearbook are you looking at?
@SenFeinstein Can you please introduce a bill to protect the American citizens from illegal aliens and do nothing politicians such as yourself? Get off your duff and start working for the American people and not the Chinese spies.
@w_terrence I just love it, everybody forgets that Colin was not kicked out, he quit! The owners don't have to hire or even contemplate hiring a quitter.
@AOC Why don't you hire Colin as one of your interns?
@BBCWorld Can my granddaughters come and stay with me in the US while they wait  for the immigration papers to make their way through the process like  many asylum seekers get to do while they wait? Currently, they are on a  9-year waiting list just to have the papers reviewed.
@1a @RepRoKhanna Ok, let's go for a 10th Century wall. About 50 feet tall with ramparts. and boiling oil pots, or maybe just cold water. It should also be about 30 feet deep. That should be a good start for the wall.
@RepJohnKatko @SyracuseSchools Can my granddaughters come and stay with me in the US while they wait  for the immigration papers to make their way through the process like  many asylum seekers get to do while they wait? Currently, they are on a  9-year waiting list just to have the papers reviewed.

@Mikel_Jollett I want to jump into a water puddle but I can't jump. Oh well, maybe I will just flop down in one and pretend to swim.
@KTHopkins Maybe the cry should have been for the Muslims to assimilate into the American culture. At least we don't see Hispanic Community Patrols. Maybe a Christian community patrol should be organized. How about a Buddhist Community Patrol?
@drkenkaplan @FrankPallone Nothing ever is simple, even when it is.
@drkenkaplan @FrankPallone Nothing is ever too late. He can just do what other presidents have done it the recent past. He can declare a national emergency and even use eminent domain. At least this time it would not be for a mall or a parking lot but in actual defense of the nation.
@LiberalsImplode @JackPosobiec @GovernorVA I am not on his side but would like to make sure I am upset with the correct person and why I am upset. We have seen too many times in the past the rush to judgment and for the wrong reasons. How many people have had their pictures on yearbook pages with others?
@LiberalsImplode @JackPosobiec @GovernorVA Well...Can he still moonwalk? can absolutely be sure he was in that picture? If you can please let everyone else know how you did it. No assumptions, positive proof, please.
@MediaBuzzFNC @AreuCathy Let's put all voting ballots in English only. When you get your citizenship you have to pass an English test, so why put the ballots in Spanish? If we put them in Spanish then we need to put them in all languages to be fair.
@MediaBuzzFNC @AreuCathy He was correct. Now we need to get rid of the signs in the workplace that are in Spanish. That will help with assimilation. She should know that in Taxifornia it is required to have workplace laws in English and Spanish. What about those that don't speak either?
@thehill Taxifornia requires that their workplace laws be in English &amp; Spanish. Why not just have them in English only? If you have Japanese or French working in that area they don't get the laws in their language. They are expected to speak English. Make it the same for Spanish speakers.
@thehill The best way to do it is having all the signs in English only. Voting ballots need to be in English only. We have them in Spanish but other languages don't get the same benefit unless there is a lot in the area.

@FrankPallone Do we know who these illegal aliens are? Ask the police in Newman, CA. Do we know their background? Ask the police in Newman Ca. Do we know if they obey our laws? Ask the police in Newman, Ca. Are Illegal aliens a fake problem? Ask the Newman CA police. Fake National Emergency?

@RepLowenthal it looks a lot like San Francisco.
@TomiLahren I volunteered to put my life on the line for this country, I have worked hard. I do have relatives that actually live overseas and not connected to this continent, I paid my way through school while others relied on the public dole. I am an American Citizen, not a lawbreaker.

@LeteTete2 @Godfirst19581 @SenJeffMerkley @letetete Then send the children to jail with their parents.
@edcranium @camanpour @GretaThunberg Sounds like me when I was a kid but we didn't have a bike.
@SenJeffMerkley So you will take an illegal alien and tell American citizens to stuff it. Thank you, idiot.
@RepTedLieu That is the reason it is called MAD
@RealErinCruz @POTUS How come we never hear about hispanics getting charged?
@HillaryClinton What conditions are they protesting?
@ShanBarnsley @chrisjohnson82 @RepJoeKennedy American Citizens are getting murder by illegal aliens also. In Iran LGBT people are thrown off of roofs because of who they are without ever offending anyone. It seems like there are a lot of people getting murdered for stupid reasons or no reason at all.
@ICEgov Why is ICE targetting the legal enterprise of Chinese birth tours, but are not going after the Hispanics that are sneaking into the country to give birth? Is there anything in our laws that states women who are pregnant cannot come here? Is there a bit of discrimination there?
@camanpour @GretaThunberg Does anybody know what her degree is in? Does she advocate cloud seeding? What is she doing to end climate change? I hear talk but she is using jets to go back and forth. Polluting the atmosphere.
@DailyCaller Why does that mansion have walls? I thought the walls were immoral. Tear down that wall. Tear down the walls around Disneyland. Let our people in free and let them ride all the rides and take all the food free. Take down the Immoral Walls!

@MaVASteve @SenatorCardin @RepMaloney @lisamurkowski Do we really want to be "equal?" How much fun would that be?
@MaVASteve @SenatorCardin @RepMaloney @lisamurkowski If that is their feeling maybe men should boycott registering and when they suffer demand equal treatment, either that or let's start the draft again.
@mamajefferson2 @GlennPreidis @mac_curmudgeon @CBPArizona So do I because I speak primarily Korean at Home. Many of the countries I have been overseas had the local language and English posted everywhere. Years ago President Kim Young Sam of South Korea told his people "We need to compete on the global market, Learn English."
@CR Yes.
@fordoers Korean word of the day: Thank You = 감사합니다 (kamsahamnida).
@CoryBooker Cory do you want Sharia Law to take over? Do the women in Congress want Sharia Law? It is not that far away. There was no Muslim ban just because the countries were mostly Muslims did not make it a Muslim ban. If we made a ban on those from Tibet would that be a Buddhist ban?
@RadioFreeTom Step back and take a good look, it is a game and the Democrats are afraid of losing.
@RepBillJohnson Why is it you must Anglicize addresses going to different countries but Spanish is exempt from that. Equality on addresses, If you require it of one then it must be required of all. Start anglicizing Spanish.
@chuckwoolery @MarkYoungTruth @BFT_Podcast @RealMichaelGuy How much money was wasted by this arrest with all the people who are not getting paid to do this. 2 Officers at 9 AM could have done the same job with little waste of money.

@PattyMurray You are a little late in this report. Everybody is back to work.
@HELPCmteDems @PattyMurray Are these families going to have to pay anything into these centers? If not, why not? Do these parents smoke or drink? If they do they can stop long enough to pay for their healthcare. Yeah, I know we would be hindering their fun but sometimes...
@PattyMurray health care is a business and needs to be run as such. The VA runs it that way even though they will deny it. I want an annual physical but all the Doctor asks me is why? I haven't had one in many years &amp; she is hesitant to issue the orders for one. My question to her is why not?
@jahimes Make the requirements equal for everybody then we can equality. Pay each person for what the are worth. If one can outperform the other then they should get paid more. If you pay one the same or more because of their sex then it is not equality.
@RepMarkMeadows The DemonRats have a severe case of TDS. We need to find a vaccine for them, but I think a few of them are beyond hope. We still need to try. Take back America, MAGA! No DACA, Build the Wall, Obey the Laws, Make illegal immigration a felony and English the Official Language.
@IsraeliPM Does Isreal have anything to do with the Black Hebrew Israelites in the US? They are a very hateful group and call themselves Israelites.
@SenThomTillis You can co-sponsor all you like but regulations will not stop anything physical. We need to open our laws to harsher and full punishment. Criminals have no fear of the judicial system so they just keep on with their crimes knowing they will not be punished much.
@WalshFreedom he can run all he wants but that stationary machine will get him nowhere.

@SenatorCardin @RepMaloney @lisamurkowski When I was in the military we had several women in our unit. They always ask the men to come and move some equipment because it was too heavy for them. One of the women was constantly sitting on the lap of the 1st Sgt. Another kept saying she thought she was pregnant.
@SenatorCardin @RepMaloney @lisamurkowski Are women going to register for the draft? Are women in the military going to have to meet the same physical standards that the men have? Is this also going to apply for the Fire and Police? It is an old thing but still true. Men are physically different than women.
@tedlieu @SpeakerPelosi You would give a standing ovation to anyone who poops in a pile.
@mamajefferson2 @GlennPreidis @mac_curmudgeon @CBPArizona Much worse. The illegals are running at will. SF is nothing but a large toilet to the point there is AP for your phone that shows where the poop is. In LA there are areas where you actually think you are living south of the border with street vendors and nothing in English.
@mamajefferson2 @GlennPreidis @mac_curmudgeon @CBPArizona You haven't been to LA or SF lately have you?
@RepJudyChu @Ilhan @SenMurphyOffice Yeah, she just wants to ban Jews.
@NormaJTorres @usairforce I went to Edwards AFB to sign up for their Small Business Opportunities but the lady that was in charge said I couldn't because I was white. This was back around 2012.
@Breaking911 President Trump should decline and hold the State of the Union on the Border on 1/29/19. The send a copy to Empress Pelosi.
@RubenGallego @tombrokaw It does happen but there are many who do not. My wife is assimilating well, to point she complains about those who don't speak English. I am for making the English the Official Language. We need to have one language that everyone speaks. I myself speak Korean at home.
@JxhnBinder Why?
@WalshFreedom The best bet is don't go into the school. Let the teachers handle it themselves. Why put the officer at risk for their PC Feelings.

@Ptjones1968 @BBCWorld Catch and release has been going on a long time. That is what I am bitter about Why can't my grandchildren come here and stay with me while they wait for their paperwork to go through. https://t.co/EcRBG0CDzX
@Ptjones1968 @BBCWorld It is common for adults to "rent" or "borrow" children because they know they will get better treatment at the borders. Once they are in the system and split up paternity tests are done before the children are returned. That makes sure the right children go to the right parents.
@Ptjones1968 @BBCWorld The kids that were separated from their parents were the ones whose parents were s3ent to jail. We don't lock up kids with their parents in jail. One of the reasons some of the kids have not been united is due to their DNA is not matching the people they came with.
@Ptjones1968 @BBCWorld The ones that are locked up are the ones that have been caught before. Those that are "clean" are now, in some areas, are catch and release. This has been the policy at least since the Obama Administration.

@Ilhan Those people are private citizens and not federal workers. They work for a company, not for the government. Talk to their companies and if they worked during that time then yes they should get paid and they didn't it is up o their company to decide not you.
@DiamondandSilk For Democrats: Can my granddaughters come and stay with me in the US while they wait for the immigration papers to make their way through the process like many asylum seekers get to do while they wait? If not, why not? Is there any reason Asian's don't get the same benefits?

If not, why not? Is there any reason Asian's don't get the same benefits?
@SenatorBaldwin Congress needs to lose their pay for that time. They went on vacation and partied for that time instead of being at their job working on the problem. Coming in and saying no is not working on the problem. No Pay For Congress Act.
@Ptjones1968 @BBCWorld Upon reflection, I am bitter about one thing and that is I want to get my grandchildren here. Currently, they are on a 9-year waiting list. I would like for them to get the same benefit an illegal alien gets, being able to stay in the country until their paperwork is processed.
@Ptjones1968 @BBCWorld Not bitter just OWG. It corroborated by Willie Brown himself. It not what went on between them but what she used it for. https://t.co/H8IzzifsIr
@RepYvetteClarke @ICEgov He Has to check in with ICE, big deal I can't even get my granddaughters here. They are on a 9-year waiting list just to have their paperwork looked at. Cry me a river because he has to check in. At least he is here.
@THEHermanCain everybody, Please don't listen to me. Do the research on Kamala Harris yourself. Find out what kind of person she really is. The information is out there, don't go with the feel-good stuff, really do your research. Don't be like CNN, Buzzfeed, MSNBC, Research.
@joey_maga @AOC Spend her mental energy elsewhere. wear those pajamas more, your mental energy is quickly draining away. She didn't mention if she ever washes those pajamas. I hope so.
@CNN Close some Universities and open more trade schools.
@senrobportman Can I put a bill forward, End Congresses Pay During Government Shutdowns Act.
@senrobportman Wrong, we need a law that states when the government has any kind of shutdown then the pay for Congress is stopped and not reimbursable. Congress holds the purse strings and when they don't do their job they should not get paid. They are the ones responsible.
@thehill And this is relevant to the Super Bowl why? What had this Daniel Radcliffe guy done to better the lives of Americans?
@WETHEPEOPLE2021 @BBCWorld Who wants to take her down. She does it on her own.
@Ptjones1968 @BBCWorld No, but she used her bedtime for advancement in her career, which is worse than paying him off. Willie Brown even admitted to that. I guess it is ok to sleep your way to the top.
@CNN What about her relationship with married men in San Francisco. Did she mention that? Ladies watch your husbands. Make sure they away from her, she has no scruples.
@BBCWorld Who is she going to sleep with this time to bring down President Trump? I don't think Willie Brown is available. Also the "US State" is the state of Taxifornia (also known as California). She is trying to team up with Gov Gavin Newsom.
@benshapiro NYC will soon outdistance planned parenthood. That is a shame.
@WalshFreedom Joe as much as I disagree with some of the things you say I do agree with you on that. Here is mine:   Take back America. No DACA, Build the Wall, Obey the Laws, Make illegal immigration a felony and English the Official Language.
@paigeweldon I know your (2nd) Aunt from Merced, CA.
@CNN People who do not get into trouble are pushed to the side again. The churches tout those who reform themselves but never celebrate those that learn to behave at all times and have never a problem.
@AlwaysActions When was this?
@TheDemocrats Stay away from the military.
@granny2651 @alexburnsNYT Yep, really.
@DrMartyFox @realDonaldTrump But only twice.
@sewwutnow Just think, what if he snuck in. Nobody would know, they would not even know his name. Are the flesh-eating bacteria communicable? I am not a doctor but I would not want anybody sneaking into the country with any kind of disease. Legal immigrants get a full examination.
@WattersWorld @Barnes_Law @JesseBWatters Could not understand your first guest in that time frame, The only reason he was worth the time was to show everybody that there are people like him out. Now for the lawyer, good luck and I hope you win every case brought on their behest. Make those kids rich.
@realDonaldTrump For the Democrats: Can my granddaughters come and stay with me in the US while they wait for the immigration papers to make their way through the process like many asylum seekers get to do while they wait? If not, why not? Is there any reason Asian's don't get the same benefits?
@jaketapper @KVUE Come on Killeen get out there and help this Vet onward. I wish I could be there but I would not make it in time. Rest in Peace.
@alexburnsNYT The only busing I can see at this point is on the side of the DemonRats. They voted no to fund the TSA and the Coast Guard. That only shows that they do not care about the safety of the American citizens. Both of them provide security for the nation.
@OfficialLivePD It is still on out here in Taxifornia. No "Live" PD for us. So far it is Danny Brown. I also hate the smell of marijuana.
@RealCandaceO @Alyssa_Milano I was going to get angry with you, then I saw Democrats at the end and now I agree with you. It also seems like it isn't just white but all races of Democrats with money use everybody else as props. As a disabled vet, I don't like to be used as a prop &amp; if they do I want good pay
@SarahPalinUSA Proof they don't care about the American Citizens. They also do not care about TSA, they voted no for funding them. They are not for the Coast Guard either, they voted no for funding them.   No DACA, Build the Wall, Obey the Laws, Make illegal immigration a felony.
@Barnes_Law @billmaher @LLinWood I hope Bill Maher was not saying he wanted to have sex with the kid. He sure expresses it enough to make you think so.
@JennyK82123748 @CNN What is a cross between sheep and guard dog? I guess I am in that area.
@JennyK82123748 @CNN Not all the sheep.
@cnni They could spend the time shopping with their children (and Husband or Wife) teaching the value of money and the quality of the food they purchase. Having someone else do it does not ensure they get the best for you. It also helps bond family members together.
@CNN Mindanao, the home of the Radical Muslims of the Philippines. Oh, you say no? What about the radical Muslin that back in 1992 threatened blow-up a KAL flight that carries US Servicemen regularly.  The Muslims have been there for at least 70 years, probably more.
@RealJamesWoods Does she always have that Joker's face?
@usminority It seems like all she has on her mind is sex. She seems to want f*** everything she can. She can start roaming the bars again and maybe she can get satisfied there. No Lady, that is for sure.
@Breaking911 At least it is not a headline from the NY Times.
@benshapiro They should go to a trade school if they can't afford the universities. Stop expecting others to pay for your way in life. Start earning it on your own. If you can afford a luxury item then buy it. I hope you are getting a 23 inch TV because the 80-inch is too much of a luxury.
@SenSchumer I want to see my granddaughters but they are on a 9-year waiting list for immigration to the US.  Can they come and stay with me in the US while they wait for the immigration papers to make their way through the process like many asylum seekers get to do while they wait?
@Din_of_Inequity That took a while, but I have retired from the translating job.
@CNN Do you think many will learn how the elderly feel all the time when the government, federal, state and local, raise their taxes? How does it feel when the costs go up because the minimum wage is raised higher and the cost is passed along to the consumers? The elderly pay for it.
@CNN CNN the purveyor of Fake News. Take back America, MAGA! Equality of the sexes, women must register for the draft. No DACA, Build the Wall, Obey the Laws, Make illegal immigration a felony and English the Official Language.
@sportsmanho @kerpen @DanLamothe @KurtSchlichter @sandboxvet1 No, it does not. If served in Vietnam then you are a Vietnam vet. If you served in the military during that time then you are Vietnam Era Vet. Big Difference. If you served when there was no war then you are just a vet or a cold-war vet.
@Laurie78768890 They can abort up to the due date. What happens when the baby comes earlier than the due to date? Do they just throw it away without consequence? DemonRats, the protectors of life? I can see it now, the overrunning of NY by upset pregnant women not wanting their children
@MartinHeinrich I don't see a great diversity of people there. Why not? Take back America, MAGA! Equality of the sexes, women must register for the draft. No DACA, Build the Wall, Obey the Laws, Make illegal immigration a felony and English the Official Language.
@charliekirk11 Let us find them and fine them each $20,000 to be put toward the wall. We can then kick them out and confiscate their property and put that toward the wall. No DACA, Build the Wall, Obey the Laws, Make illegal immigration a felony and English the Official Language.
@BartB75231815 @RaBaer @RepJayapal Are you kidding? Why do you think she is here?
@boobelina @BernieSanders If you can't afford the debt, don't make the debt. You got the benefit now pay up.
@BernieSanders How are you going to pay those for-profit universities? Are the professors going to forced to teach for free, are builders going to forced to build for free? Are the office supply stores going to forced to give supplies for free? Where does it end? Open more trade schools!
@BanThisJack1 @JudgeJeanine Also if your teeth were damaged while in the military. I am not sure if it had to happen during combat or not. I also need to add the VA does offer a paid through Delta Dental but the fees are more than what Costco customers pay.
@chinabeach59 What Branch? I was USAF and am Vietnam ERA Vet. The closest I got was Misawa, Japan. As a teenager, I would spend time at the Tachikawa Air Terminal playing cards all night long with the guys to and from Vietnam. That was in the early '70s.
@JudgeJeanine Well, we can be sure this is not happening to the normal veteran at the VA. They don't give us dental.
@dbongino @JudgeJeanine Dan, See if anybody can answer this: Can my granddaughters come and stay with me in the US while they wait for the immigration papers to make their way through the process like many asylum seekers get to do while they wait? If not, why not?
@SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump So...when it came to vote for funding the TSA you voted no. When it came to funding the Coast Guard you voted no. When it comes to protecting American Citizens you vote no. At least you are consistent. Does not care about the security and safety of the American Citizens.
@ron_raggio @SebGorka President Trump has started on reducing the costs. I wonder how DemonRats have completed their promises. Congressman Jim Costa promised during his campaign not to vote for Nancy Pelosi as Leader. Guess what? He did not live up to his promise, and that was less than 3 months in.
@LouDobbs @SebGorka Nancy: Let's pass the 5.7b request from President Trump to see if it will fix some of the problems. This is kind of like we must pass it to see what is in it.	Lou: We know Nancy has been infected with TDS. We need to call the corpsmen, or maybe as Obama says the corpse men
@starsandstripes Women around Kamala Harris if they are married. She is already known to have affairs and married men are not beyond her scope. Ask Willie Brown. She is also known to "Stretch" the truth when it comes to laws. Know about her before you vote for her.
@PattyMurray I was hurt when the DemonRats would not build the Wall. Take back America, MAGA! Equality of the sexes, women must register for the draft. No DACA, Build the Wall, Obey the Laws, Make illegal immigration a felony and English the Official Language.
@reason Can they take me to prison so I can retire?
@CNN What is a Bansky mural? Is it worth anything? Why? Any suspects yet? Where was it last seen? Was it advertising a movie? Is the movie any good? How does the movie cost? Do they have real popcorn salt there?
@realDonaldTrump Democrats: Can my granddaughters come and stay with me in the US while they wait for the immigration papers to make their way through the process like many asylum seekers get to do while they wait? If not, why not? Is there any reason Asian's don't get the same benefits?

@AOC And we notice how you use one of the monopolies instead of fighting against it. The other major thing going against the current journalist is FAKE NEWS. Don't believe me ask the teens at Covington High School. Hold the journalist feet to the fire to report credible news.
@WalshFreedom Just think he could have had it built in the US except for the 10%  luxury tax put on by the federal government. Most superyachts are now built outside the US because of that tax. The people could use the money that would have been spent here but went to another country.
@CNN Why would we believe him when his former wife could not believe in him to uphold their marriages vows?
@Alyssa_Milano Don't forget the collusion Obama had with Russia. Don't forget the friends of Obama: Bill Ayers, Michael Pfleger, Jeremiah Wright, Louis Farrakhan and more. President Trumps main contact with Russia had to do with his business companies. Many people have contact with the Russians

@WalshFreedom I believe it is our God-given right to pay the least amount of tax that we can. We need to give the government the least amount so that we can control them instead of them controlling us. They need to do more with less, just like the people they govern.
@VickyS13579299 @stz41 @OversightDems @RepCummings The emails were recovered after a long time but she delayed their recovery by every trick she could think of. Roll your eyes all you want but people have died because of the Clintons. Don't forget Bill Clinton was impeached while in office for his lying.
@VickyS13579299 @stz41 @OversightDems @RepCummings That server had been hacked. Clinton said she did not know they were classified, but she has been around enough to know the markings for classified. She tried covering it up by deleting the emails but the emails were on different machines around the nation. Not all were deleted.
@VickyS13579299 @stz41 @OversightDems @RepCummings The Clinton Foundation was a cover for donations so individuals could get access to higher ranking individuals in our government. It was a pay for play scheme that the Clintons were running. The emails contained classified information and they were on an unsecured server.
@VickyS13579299 @stz41 @OversightDems @RepCummings Apparently, you don't understand that Benghazi was not a "thing." People died there. As a military vet, I know there were jets on a Tarmac within 20 minutes to go in and help them. The order was not given and Clinton was covering it up by saying it was because of a "video."
@hollywoodcurry @washingtonpost I was talking about food from the south like from Georgia, South Carolina and Mississi[ppi. In Taxifornia it is hard to find good southern food.

@paulsperry_ True: Obama is worst all time, followed by Clinton, then Carter. Obama: The apologetic President. Clinton: Impeached for lying, what else needs to be said? Carter: gave away the Panama Canal. President Trump is trying to keep campaign promises &amp; Empress Pelosi doesn't want that.

@CNN If the teachers are complaining about class size then I suggest calling ICE to remove the illegal aliens from our schools and sent them back. That would take of class sizes.
@DavidAFrench He is nothing but a liar and an antagonist. CNN and MSNBC ought to be ashamed for promoting him. Did he go AWOL from the military, if so did he get a dishonorable discharge from the military? If not why not? If he went AWOL then calling himself a Vet is wrong.

@AG_Conservative I think AOC is trying to figure out what facts are. Nobody has told what fact-checking means or they told her the wrong thing. I believe she thinks that what she says does not have to be checked just automatically be the truth. It is hard for her to lose it when she never had it.
@Nimajneb80 @SaraCarterDC Thanks, I did see this and my answer to that was: "I am sick and tired of not being able to do things because it may offend others from other countries. Well...tough, if they get offended they can leave my country and never come back. We need to take back out own country."
@katm876 @RepKClark Fund the Wall of the seas, the Coast Guard! No DACA, Build the Wall, Obey the  Laws, Make illegal immigration a felony and English the Official  Language.
@katm876 @RepKClark For those that prefer their liquid groceries (beer and such), they have to show an ID. About the only person in Presidents Trumps cabinet that I saw that is out of touch was Wilbur Ross suggesting to take out a loan. Some banks are working with those furloughed.
@katm876 @RepKClark In this case for those requesting a tab or help during the shutdown, it is not bad to check for status. A Federal ID card will help the person get the help so others are not trying scam the helpers. So yes showing an ID is not bad.
@katm876 @RepKClark I take you meant "say" not "saw." Anyway, I have seen it in my lifetime where some stores will help out people. I know even today when I go for a discount at certain stores I need to show an ID. For military discount, I have to show my VA card.
@marklevinshow She wants clap?
@OversightDems @RepCummings Have you started the security investigation into, Nancy Pelosi, Dianne Feinstein or AOC yet? Empress Pelosi seems like she may have a few mental problems, Feinstein likes having Chinese spies as drivers and what can we say about AOC other than just pay for it?

@RepKClark I have run tabs for food in America, Canada, Japan, Korea, and the Philippines. You get to know your neighborhood stores and they get to know you. Being trustworthy, and kind always helps.
@RepKClark Maybe you get back out there and go to some Mom and Pop stores. When you get to know them some of them will let you run a tab. Better yet, you should actually do the shopping in person instead of ordering it all the time. Get a clue, and I have been sho[pping a longer than you.
@washingtonpost I have the same problem, but it is hard to find southern food in a Taxifornia Grocery Market.

@SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump I am sick and tired of not being able to do things because it may offend others from other countries. Well...tough, if they get offended they can leave my country and never come back. We need to take back out own country. As President Trump said Make America Great Again.

@ewarren Is George Soros included in this? As a poor OWG, I am opposed to this. We need to keep the government in check. The other reason the DemonRats don't want to fund the government is they don't want to fund the Coast Guard because they act as a wall on the seas. No wall for them.
@FAIRImmigration @realDailyWire @emzanotti When do I get to have my granddaughters come here to stay? They are on a 9-year waiting list to come here legally. Why do people who come here illegally get the benefits? Definitely not fair. equality in the system please. let those who file first come here first.
@benshapiro Love it, Native American Elder, not, Elder Native American, Yes. May the Washington Post is correct in one area. The face-off between Catholic Teens and Elder native American. The Native American is the one who approached the Catholic teens for the stand-off, not the other way.
@PoliticalShort Is there any truth to Nathan Philips going AWOL?
@RepJayapal How many DemonRats voted on the bills - all of them. No opening the government. Get off your high horse and compromise. Don't follow Empress Pelosi in everything. Empresses can be wrong sometimes. We don't have to vote to see what is in it. It is harmful to the people.
@Jim_Jordan @SpeakerPelosi Let's make a correction, it is not speaker Pelosi but it is Empress Pelosi. We now have to bow to her whenever she breathes. It is a sad time now but we have to abide by her decrees to find out how it will be. President Trump, please give the speech. I suggest the CA Border.
@DRUDGE_REPORT It is my money, not your money. You can give your money if you want but leave mine alone. I worked for it, not you. Why don't you try to protect the American citizens instead of trying to control them? You and AOC can move to DPRK where there is no problem of too much money.
@RealJamesWoods She will be at the hospital later complaining of a sore throat and we will have to pay for her visit.
@brianschatz I am on SS Disability and am broke all the time. I would rather be working but am unable to and SS doesn't give you much even though I paid in all my life.
@washingtonpost Phillips just wants the spotlight.
@RepMikeQuigley It demoralizing to have a part of your unit out and until to perform their job while changing sexes, They are getting paid the same and should be on duty and not out for an elective procedure that will put them out for a long time.
@AOC To be fair her answer was "Zero" not zero F***s. So far this is the only time that I can agree with her. Please print what is correct6 not what you want to hear. If you want to print what you want, go write a book. No Fake News, Just News.
@GavinNewsom How about the people who are declared overweight. Even though they can do the job they are demeaned, harassed, and even kicked out for the way they look. Some people are genetically inclined to be bigger than the "average" person.
@RowdyJT @ChrisCoons The government is the ones who have deemed them non-critical. I am going by the way the government has classified  them. They may be Vital but they are not critical different meaning. Personally, the way it is going the Congress needs to be without pay until it is solved.
@Emerald06Lisa @sarandipt @ChrisCoons Is it true when someone disagrees with you they are a Russian troll? Did you ever disagree with your mother?
@Emerald06Lisa @sarandipt @ChrisCoons I am what?
@Emerald06Lisa @sarandipt @ChrisCoons Having worked as a contractor is up to the contractor to pay its employees not the government. The government gives the money to the contractor, not to the employee. The contractor will eventually get reimbursed for their expenses. I worked during the '95 shutdown with no problem
@Emerald06Lisa @sarandipt @ChrisCoons You have no idea what a Russian troll is. The people who are furloughed are in non-critical positions. Them not working does not affect the operations of the government. There are those who are not getting paid but are still working.
@FLOTUS @WhiteHouse Thank You.
@nellie501 Everybody seems to think the Native Americans were these peace-loving people but if you look at their own history you find they were not always so. Please learn from history.
@ChrisCoons There are not large parts of the government shutdown. Less than 1/4 is shut down and they are in the non-critical areas. Fake News abounds. Nancy needs to come back to the table and negotiate but she wants to be in control by not negotiating. She is trying to be Queen.
@jeannine_bartel @senrobportman If they want to get their back pay they need to stay, so they are indentured servants. Since they are free to leave so they are not slaves.
@senrobportman let's stop the human trafficking! Make illegal immigration a felony, Build the Wall, Obey the Laws and make English the Official Language.
@RepJayapal @senatemajldr Meanwhile, Nancy Pelosi has been parting in Hawaii and taken off for other parties and time off. You are getting food hand out while she parties. At least President Trump has stayed at the White House in hopes somebody would see him about a negotiated end to the shutdown. Not yet
@seungminkim @katiezez @DavidNakamura Now that the DemonRats have said the dreamers are a non-starter it is now time to take them off the table. Start finding them and escorting them out of the country. They came here illegally, and yes I know, by no fault of their own, but still, the fact is they are here illegally
@BreitbartNews Why do the women there like the middle finger so much? Are they having dreams again?
@RepJimCosta @CCHCCBiz @fresnometrobcc Time for you to get back to DC and meet with President Trump to get the Wall built and the government opened back up. You are supposed to be working for us, not the illegal aliens.
@RepJimCosta @CCHCCBiz @fresnometrobcc If illegal aliens are caught they should not be allowed to file any claims, no asylum, no legal immigration, nothing. they have already proven they can't be trusted. they need to come in the correct way. Build the Wall, Obey the Laws and make English the Official Language.
@RepJimCosta @CCHCCBiz @fresnometrobcc Why aren't legal immigrants given at least the same treatment? If the legal immigrants can't stay then the illegal aliens should not be allowed to stay. If they get caught sneaking into the States then they should not be allowed to make any claims for at least 10 years.
@RepJimCosta @CCHCCBiz @fresnometrobcc Illegal aliens get caught and they are released to come back for a court hearing. They are released in the States, but legal immigrants don't get the same treatment. They are not allowed to stay in the States until their case comes up. What about equal treatment?
@RepJimCosta @CCHCCBiz @fresnometrobcc I have tried getting help from your office but the will not help me. My granddaughters are on a waiting list for legal immigration and the waiting time is currently 9 years. Why is it such a long time? How about some help trying to understand why the long time?
@RepJimCosta @CCHCCBiz @fresnometrobcc What happened? You were in your own district for a change. What made you visit us? I thought you were too busy going to parties (Puerto Rico) and fighting for the illegal aliens. Are you going to help the American citizen in your district? Help legal immigrants. Too long waiting.
@CNN Build the Wall, obey the Laws, Make illegal immigration a felony, make English the Official Language. The less illegal aliens sneaking in the fewer drugs there will be on the streets. Watch your kids. The heck with kids privacy, know what your kids are doing. Watch them!
@BreitbartNews And we should care, why?
@GavinNewsom We would have more money to fall back on if you didn't allow the illegal aliens to get whatever they want and we didn't have to spend money on them. We are sending to school (money) we are trying to teach them English (money) They are using the ER (money) Who are these people?
@NevadaJack2 What can we do about locked doors? Congressman Jim Costa's Merced, CA office requires you to be buzzed in. Their door is locked and you have to request permission to enter the front office area. Jails are not that secure. At least in jail, you can see who is at the desk.
@NevadaJack2 Do you think Nancy will require Disneyland take down its wall since they don't work and are immoral? Disneyland, let me in free because I want to go and can't afford your fee or wait in line. I don't want you to know who I am or what I will do while I am there. Build the Wall!
@PattyMurray Take away the pay of the government officials until the shutdown is fixed. No pay for Congress, supreme court or executive branch. That way everybody will feel the pain. It will make them want to work harder instead of taking off for parties. Build the Wall, Obey the Laws!
@RepJayapal @realDonaldTrump Another thing, Drinking does not help you being diabetic. There is sugar in those drinks.
@RepJayapal @realDonaldTrump Do you have a main doctor? I have never gone to the ER to get insulin and I have been a diabetic for almost 30 years and on Insulin. There are prescription discounts available. My wife just got her insulin for $5. You just need for your doctor to prescribe the insulin to you.
@TheDemocrats Is there funding for the Wall yet?
@SenatorMenendez @MontclairBread I guess they are being treated like the homeless, free coffee and food? What about their pay? Negotiate and get the wall built and we won't have this problem. Build the Wall, Obey the Laws and make English the Official Language.
@ElizabethHeng I wonder if there is any buyer's remorse for not electing you to Congress? So far as I can tell Costa is doing the bidding of Pelosi every chance he can. He voted for her for the speakership. He went to Puerto Rico for the weekend party. He doesn't want to build the wall.
@ewarren @realDonaldTrump Why is the census being written in Spanish? If you put Spanish on there then put every other language that is spoken in America there. Make English the Official Language in America!
@RepJimCosta @HouseForeign Why did you go party in Puerto Rico? Why did you lie to us during the elections when you said you would not vote for Pelosi? Why? You are not that honorable if you can't tell us the truth.
@BillPascrell How many people would have to work extra for her trip? It was bad enough the DemonRats were partying last weekend you don't need to be jaunting all over the place during a partial shutdown. Congress needs to be at work until the shutdown ends, that includes weekends. 24/7
@RepDonBeyer @SpeakerPelosi That's bull and you know it. She was going but now she has to make other plans or pay for it herself. It seems like her whole move was to be gone when the next pay cycle hits. Trying to get out of the kitchen. Build the Wall, obey the laws and make English the Official Language.
@KatiePavlich Because of his friends.
@CNN @cnnhealth Watch out the next thing will be hair color dyes.
@senatemajldr Start with the wall around Disneyland.
@benshapiro There were also only 48 states when I was born.
@benshapiro Reel-to-Reel, 8 Track, light switch on the floorboard of a car, AM, FM Shortwave, Black and white TV. Bell bottoms, elephant leg pants, bloomers, and a few others.
@KMJNOW @BroeskeMusson @dianetcb @cityofdavispd @ucdavis BLM was upset that they weren't mentioned.
@benshapiro maybe the next mugger will think twice about trying to mug someone. Harsh penalties are sometimes the only thing that will through to some people. If someone were mugging my wife you can bet I would not hold back.
@RepScottPeters @senatemajldr Fake News, All the DemonRats have been partying for the last couple of weeks.
@PattyMurray The Congress should be suffering more than the federal workers. The contractors who are affected by the shutdown should really consider who they are working for. During the 1995 shutdown, the contractors were paid by the companies they worked for and the government paid them.
@BlazeTV @realDonaldTrump Should have buzzed them first.
@dbongino Let's make illegal immigration a felony.
@NewsHour @MarkWarner Get off the TV and go see President Trump to negotiate for the end of the shutdown. Complaining about it will not solve it. Put your big boy pants on and man-up. Get to work for the American Citizens and no more partying in Puerto Rico.
@PattyMurray How many days were the DemonRats out of town and not working on the budget? DemonRats need to get back to work and negotiate for the end of the shutdown. No DACA, make illegal Immigration a felony, build the Wall, Obey the Laws and make English the Official Language.
@SarahPalinUSA Don't forget about the wall around Disneyland. That is one big wall. I want to be able to sneak in ride their rides without paying. I don't want to stand in line like other people in the world. Get rid of walls around Disneyland so we can have our freedom! Will this happen? Ha!
@jeddi03 @ElizabethHeng I want to know when Disneyland is going to be forced to take down their wall around the parks? I want to sneak in to ride their rides without paying so much for it and I don't want to stand in line for it.
@repblumenauer Are you going to force Doctors to work for free? Why should the average American work to give Healthcare to someone who will not work for anything and just wants everything given to them?
@ElizabethHeng I have been trying to call his DC Office and his Merced Office but no answer today 1/12/19. Must be a federal holiday that we don't know about. His office says he is against the Wall but to access his Merced office you have to be buzzed in because they have the door locked.
@RepJimCosta @CoveredCA Why is it nobody answers your phone today? I don't think it is a holiday. Where did you spend your weekend? Were you in Puerto Rico this last weekend. I talked to your office and they said you are against the wall. Does that mean Disneyland has to take down their wall?
@Trump454545 Her name should be Maxine Aneezah waters. If she wants sharia law then she can have but take it somewhere else and don't expect my wife to follow it.
@PattyMurray Give us details!
@washingtonpost Why does Disneyland have a wall around its park? As far as tunnels go, bring in some of the equipment used on the DMZ for tunnel locating.
@VeteransHealth Why is when I ask for a physical Exam the doctor doesn't think I need it? I have not had one in about 10 years and we are always told get one each year but the VA doesn't want to do it.
@_waleedshahid All I can see you running for is the money that other people earn. Let us keep what we earn and quit giving it to those who don't want to work.  No Socialism, No more Taxes, Keep your hands out of our pockets!
@AOC Build the Wall and have less illegal Aliens in your classes.
@FrankPallone What Comey did was just pure idiocy. He should have gone after Hillary instead of letting her off. He swore an oath to the country, not to Hillary.
@DRUDGE_REPORT Jeff is dumb, following in the footsteps Mayor Viagra of LA.
@TheDemocrats What we need to shut down is the time off and vacations being taken by Congress. They need to be there 24/7 until the government is open and the Wall started. Make illegal immigration a felony, obey the Laws, Immigration=First in-line, first in. Make English the Official Langauge
@TomiLahren Tough, BLM undermines itself. Celebrate the people who protect you even though you don't think so.
@DirtyOak77 @w_terrence @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Before going south we need to take away the power of the criminals here.
@DiamondandSilk Watched lie and I need hip waders now the crap is getting so deep. Taxifornia should be ashamed for putting her in charge. Jim Costa on the campaign trail said he would not vote for her as the speaker and guess what? He voted for her. He is not representing his constituents. LIAR
@MarkWarner At least he has done more than all the Senators have put together. Get to work for the American people and not the illegal aliens. No DACA, Make Illegal Immigration a Felony, Build the Wall, Obey the Laws and make English the Official Language. Protect America!
@heyitsCarolyn That was meant for Beto and his minions.
@heyitsCarolyn dear minion, do you realize that the VA does not give Dental to the Veterans. They offer a program which has a higher fee than COSTCO members have using the same service. The military also give children in other countries dental services, What about Americans? Can we get same?
@DRUDGE_REPORT AOC has a hoard of minions following here around taking her picture everytime she opens her mouth. They are twittering constantly with not learning how to read and will twitter about anything that hurts their little snowflake souls. Now run for your safe room where you can color.
@RepJayapal Dear Minion, Please learn to read. It is not about Immigrants but it is about ILLEGAL ALIENS who are trying to overrun the country and take whatever they can. Caravans of 15,00 or more are not people taking a stroll in the park.
@realDonaldTrump 6/6 In summary No DACA, Make Illegal Immigration a Felony, Build the Wall, Obey the Laws and make English the Official Language. Protect America!
@realDonaldTrump 5/6 We could confiscate all property of those caught here illegally and used for the Wall, just like we do for drug busts. We could charge a fee on all monies transferred by wire or check being sent south of the border.
@realDonaldTrump 4/6 We would need to charge the fee on non-American passengers on the airlines. Legal immigrants would be exempt from the fee. Once the border is completely funded and a 10-year backup fund established then we can suspend the border fee.
@realDonaldTrump 3/6 We need to get our own security in order before we help anyone else. You want Mexico to pay for the Wall then start charging every Non-American crossing the borders a $10 Border Security Fee. This fee would be applied to all individuals not just by car. Pedestrian included.
@realDonaldTrump 2/6 In 2018 the Democrats voted in Senate Amendment to H.R. 1625 On page 394 gave Jordan $5M for border enhancements. Egypt (1391) Lebanon (1397) Libya (1397-1398) Pakistan (1449) are all receiving monies and help with their border security. Why are we helping other countries?
@realDonaldTrump 1/6 The Wall is old technology but still valid. Used in conjunction with modern technology the border can be made secure. without the Wall, it would be harder to catch the illegal aliens because they need the extra time to get onsite. A little bit of time will make a difference.
@WalshFreedom No DACA, make illegal immigration a felony. Build the Wall, Obey the Laws and make English the Official Language.
@SenatorBaldwin Don't forget there is more to labor than unions. How about the Right to Work? People should be able to work without paying for that right. Many times the money they give the unions go to politicians and causes the worker does not support. The workers need to keep their money.
@DRUDGE_REPORT Hitting the ground flying is usually called a crash, now hitting the ground running would be much better.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Over the last 3 weeks, how many days have you been on vacation while President Trump waited for someone to show up to work on reopening the government? You have no run to twitter about it. I understand this is not Ted Lieu, just a minion but please think before twittering.

@ChrisVanHollen @RussVought45 Can you go back and get us verifiable numbers. I was a contractor during the 1995 shutdown and we did not miss any checks. I was even overseas for it.

@ImmDef @L_Toczylowski @RepJayapal @CBP When do I get my granddaughters here legally? They are on a 9-year waiting list. Why aren't you helping them get here faster? Because they are trying to do it legally make them worse than the ones coming here illegally? Equality in immigration. First come first in.
@513eats @senrobportman @JerryMoran Problem found now correct it or is that too simple for you to figure out. Since it is a prototype it can be fixed going down the road. Prototypes are made to find out what is wrong and to be tested. Take some of the money you have in your sex slush fund and put it to good use.
@senrobportman @JerryMoran They are still illegally. I am still trying to get my granddaughters here legally. How can they get the same benefits the illegals get. No fault of their own still does not make it right. Their parents need to be held accountable and convicted of child trafficking.
@TheDemocrats Yeah, We need the beer back on the shelves so we can drown our sorrows from what the Democrats are doing to us. Look at SF and NYC.
@SenKamalaHarris The real crisis is politicians who put the needs of illegal aliens over the needs of the American citizens.
@tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump How did we survive without TSA in the past?
@Acosta It stands to reason. The illegals aliens come in and then run straight out so they don't get caught. Not enough time to do anything.
@TX_Vet1 @BreitbartNews @CortesSteve Hang on - I am gathering the "evidence." but first I have to go do that 4 letter word ending in K - Work.
@TX_Vet1 @BreitbartNews @CortesSteve Nothing new about that, the Democrats do it all the also. Everybody cherry picks the items they want to make their point. Look at the current shuts down and how some janitors are not getting paid and they will be in the poor house because of the shutdown. It is a known tactic.
@TX_Vet1 @BreitbartNews @CortesSteve Read this one and they really need to specify between legal and illegal immigrants. I have noticed that when many of the illegal aliens are stopped for DUI in Taxifornia they are given a ticket and let go. An American citizen usually has his car towed and arrested. Cop verified.
@TX_Vet1 @BreitbartNews @CortesSteve If they weren't here then they would not commit the crime. One crime is one too many. It can be fact checked all day long but it still that fact they are here legally and should leave and come back in the correct way.
@TX_Vet1 @BreitbartNews @CortesSteve E-Verify is optional even in Texas, and many employers do not use. I wish they would.
@TX_Vet1 @BreitbartNews @CortesSteve They match name and SSAN and get by that way. As far as hiring illegals: The DNC hired Cindy Nava with full knowledge of her “undocumented status." The State of Taxifornia has also hired illegal aliens knowing what they are to be on boards for the state.
@TX_Vet1 @BreitbartNews @CortesSteve One of the reasons is that the Democrats had put into law you cannot question a person's documents when they give them to you no matter what you think. I personally want to questions documents that I think are bogus but the law would go after me if I did that. Agree with penalty
@TX_Vet1 @BreitbartNews @CortesSteve As far as specification, it does need to be made. My mother, ex-wife, and wife are all LEGAL Immigrants. There is a big difference between illegal and legal. When you make a generalized accusation specify to whom you are making it against.
@TX_Vet1 @BreitbartNews @CortesSteve Yes, God is Good, As far as sex being stupid that is up to you. Giving false documents to work - Felon. What is their real name? Ask the policeman who was killed in Newman Ca by an illegal alien. He had several different aliases and his whole family was here illegally.
@TX_Vet1 @BreitbartNews @CortesSteve Specify Illegal or Legal. All illegals aliens are criminals, to begin with, but legal immigrants are not. The base and even the Democrats have a lower crime rate than illegal aliens.
@BreitbartNews @CortesSteve This is what CNN thinks about America. It is boring to them. Get back to the news and get Navarro a nail salon job, but then again she may not good enough for that.
@stylist4trump Hang tough and say it.
@KatiePavlich I am trying to get my granddaughters here legally but they are on a 9-year waiting list to enter the country as immigrants.
@SenKamalaHarris So far what I can say about Kamal Harris and her specialty in Taxifornia was sleeping her way to the top. Ask Willie Brown he knows for sure.
@TheDemocrats Seeking asylum is a privilege but it doesn't have to be granted. You can apply all day long but that doesn't mean you will be granted asylum. By the UN charter, you must accept asylum in the first country that offers it to you. If you don't then you are no longer an asylum seeker
@AOC @DailyCaller @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews And what do you call what is being done to President Trump by the Democrats? Targeting maybe?
@chuckwoolery Find out what your heritage is and then move back there.

@CNNPolitics Nancy Pelosi doesn't understand that illegal aliens cost more to the American Financial Insecurity than the federal shutdown does. There is no effect on from the shutdown until 1/14/19 when the first check will be missed. Nancy, you still have a few days to get your act together.

@DRUDGE_REPORT This is justified.
@ChelBelle86 @CDCgov I understand that but if we don't know who they are there is no way to track them. The American kids that don't get vaccinated need to be identified and appropriate actions are taken. The main point of my comment is who are the illegal aliens and what is their medical history.
@RepDelBene Does your house or apartment building have a wall, fence, doorman or something else equally antiquated? If so why shouldn't the country have something that will help slow down the "invaders?" Also, dragging a ladder across the Rio Grands will be hard to do if you want the climb.

@CDCgov Can we get a real idea of how many of the illegal aliens are carrying viruses that they can pass to our children? Hard to define especially since they don't register with anyone when they sneak into the country. We don't even know their real names are their medical history.

@jihadwatchRS I still want to know why that "woman" has sex on her mind so much that she has to tell the president? She wants to him to have sex with a woman that has a child and then impeach him? She needs some moral reassignment, send her to China.
@TheDemocrats Do you have any T-Shirts for the White women that were shut out of the feminist march?
@RMConservative In order to vote, you must be an American Citizen. In order to become an American citizen, you must pass an English test. Voting needs to be done in English only.

@RepKarenBass DFo you have an autopsy on the boy who died. I have been diabetic since 1995 and I would like to know what caused the young mans death. Was it really the lack of insulin or some other underlying reason. Please back up your accusations. I cut back on things because of taxes in CA.
@RepKarenBass I have found that going to my congresswoman or my senator is completely useless because I am an OWG. If I were an illegal alien I would get what I want. I find it reprehensible American citizen are not represented by the people they elect to serve them especially the Democrats.

@TheDemocrats No! Let their own country handle them. If they want advice then give it to them, Don't let them in just for that reason. No more reason for letting people to the head of the line. We have millions waiting in line to get in. Deal with them first, otherwise, everyone claims abuse.
@CNN From what I read the official did not force the guy to cut his hair. He was given an option but not forced. He could have not cut his hair. There are many things in society where people are given the choice and their decision dictates what will happen with their lives.
@SenatorTomUdall @SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov Why didn't the child's father immediately ask for aid for his kid instead of rejecting the aid? The blame needs to go to the parents for the way they have brought the kids into the country. Sneaking over the border is not the correct way. Build the Wall, Obey the laws.
@ChrisCoons Where have you been for the last 2 years? When the Democrats fully fund the border 'wall' then we can talk about fully funding the government.
@SenWarren How can we trust anyone who lies on their work applications?
@nellie501 @SenFeinstein She should not go down to the border, she needs to work in her office for the American citizens, not the so-called asylum seekers. That is the purview of the State Department.
@CNN You are citing innuendos, please cite the regulations you think that is being violated.
@BreitbartNews Goof not good, dang fast fingers.
@BreitbartNews I think this good is on Breitbart and not Cortez, this time. Manager vs Manger.
@BreitbartNews How many babies are there in managers? That sure is a funny place for babies. I know in the Bible they talked about a baby in a manger but not a manager. Maybe they are talking about female managers having a baby. I could understand that, but how many managers are refugees?
@CNN Will we even notice a cutback in that area? I am not sure they were working, to begin with.
@AMike4761 DNA/Paternity tests, please.
@TitaniaMcGrath What about all the black Santas that you see around. I have even seen Asian Santas. The other question I have is why do YOU always have sex on your mind? There must be a reason you are always thinking about it. Try talking to your therapist about that and please use the pill.
@OfficeOfMike I am beginning to wonder if some of these children are really theirs. They may be child trafficking but the only way to know os if they did DNA/Paternity testing.
@JacksonLeeTX18 @realDonaldTrump FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS. Food inspections are still being done.
@jamiew714 @MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery @realDonaldTrump Does anybody know what language he is trying to speak?
@chinabeach59 Before blaming anyone there needs to be an autopsy to determine why the child died. Just blaming it on CBP won't work, just like it didn't work with Justice Kavanaugh.
@BuzzFeedNews Oh look, there is a camera. I must do something to get noticed.
@RepMarkTakano @DHSgov Before blaming anyone there needs to be an autopsy to determine why the child died. Just blaming it on CBP won't work, just like it didn't work with Justice Kavanaugh.
@Ocasio2018 FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS. Joseph and Mary were not refugees. Caesar Augustus had recently decreed that registration is carried out in the land, and people had to travel to their town of origin in order to comply.
@ChuckCallesto What is going on between Nancy and Chuckie? They always seem to be together. What kind of plan are they hatching for the ruination of the country? Other than that Merry Christmas everybody!
@JesseKellyDC Think about how the driving would improve if only citizens and authorized visitors were driving.
@MaherSolimanJD @AMike4761 I forgot all about that, thanks.
@Comey You promised you would uphold the law, did you? If so why is Hillary still walking around free? Stop yakking about the hardworking public servants not getting pay and start telling us why you did not do your job. Are you beholding to Hillary? What does she have on you? Come Clean
@nryanhernandez Good one, I didn't know the inmates wanted privacy. You would have thought they wanted to get out.
@JacksonLeeTX18 @realDonaldTrump Why is it so hard that many want the Wall?
@Ocasio2018 @GretaThunberg Don't worry she will want a new computer for Christmas. Give her an old one still running DOS.
@bhalpop @PattyMurray here is another one: https://t.co/fGaZ6JCzKc
@bhalpop @PattyMurray By the way, I said some not all.
@bhalpop @PattyMurray Here is one for the military: https://t.co/e71Kmy5c7C
@bhalpop @PattyMurray Go back and check your records you will that in the past some banks did honor the checks. As for working without pay, that is about what it was like in the military back in the '70s. We qualified for food stamps.
@RepRickLarsen Why do we have walls around prisons? Why do Hollywood actors have walls around their houses? Do you have a wall or fence around your property? IF so, why?
@nryanhernandez Why do we have walls around prisons? Why do Hollywood actors have walls around their houses? Do you have a wall or fence around your property? IF so, why?
@Polyspike @RepFrenchHill I was a government contract employee for 14 years and 9 of those were overseas. We went through several "shutdowns" and we never lost one cent. The employers may have received their pay a little late but I doubt that since many of the contracts are funded.
@JohnCornyn I haste to inform you but opioids do not target just blacks, it targets people of all colors and sexes. It is an epidemic for America. Stem the flow of heroin into the country by getting the Wall built ASAP. It will not stop but it will help. Clamp down on smuggling at ports.
@iVoteArizona @RMConservative Not to burst your bubble but the DMZ has been violated many times. There are even tunnels underneath it. They also have land mines everywhere. We are not going to be putting land mines in so there is one big difference, but we need a Wall to HELP stem the flow of illegal aliens.
@MaherSolimanJD @AMike4761 Please, blondes don't need further disrespect.
@AMike4761 If I was still hiring help Harvard, Yale, Brown and most of the Ivy League schools would be off the top of my list. The way things are going someone who graduates high school would be better than those that are indoctrinated in the so-called higher education schools.
@PattyMurray FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS. It is only a partial shut down and those who are furloughed will more than likely receive their pay when the shutdown ends. Many times the banks these people use will honor their checks like normal.
@RepMarkTakano @JacksonLeeTX18 Where is a law for men to have equal treatment in a divorce?  The tax break for the children needs to split fairly instead of the  women getting the complete write-off. Men should also get more access to  their children and a say in the what the child does.
@RepLoisFrankel @realDonaldTrump How many things have you said to your constituents that you did not follow through on no matter what the circumstances were? Build the Wall high and long, Obey our laws!
@JacksonLeeTX18 Are going to enact a law for men to have equal treatment in a divorce. The tax break for the children needs to split fairly instead of the women getting the complete write-off. Men should also get more access to their children and a say in the what the child does.
@LincolnFresno @KamalaHarris Is Congress still using its slush fund to silence accusers?
@juanj1255 @TheDemocrats Huh?
@TheDemocrats FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS. It is only a partial shut down and those who are furloughed will more than likely receive their pay when the shutdown ends. Many times the banks these people use will honor their checks like normal. Happened before
@SRuhle @stevenmnuchin1 FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS. It is only a partial shut down and those who are furloughed will more than likely receive their pay when the shutdown ends. Many times the banks these people use will honor their checks like normal.
@Polyspike @RepFrenchHill What do you consider interact workers?
@ChrisVanHollen Lump yourself in there with the cause of the furlough. Democrats always blaming others for the inability to play nice.
@Polyspike @RepFrenchHill I wish I could live paycheck to paycheck. I do not get enough for that. If my "paid vacation" bs is the worst take on twitter then thanks for reading it. Either way, I have been through many government shutdowns since the early '70s and the essentials still keep on working.
@RepBillFoster @SpeakerRyan Is the gym government run or privately run? If it is privately run then why do you want to close it other than sour grapes?
@BeckyBTaylor @RepRaskin Another thing, the people coming across the border are not just hispanics, the day before yesterday 2 Chinese were caught trying to come across in a hang glider. Also Hispanic is not a race, it is a culture.
@BeckyBTaylor @RepRaskin This one I don't understand. What has a wall got to do with racism? If anything the illegal aliens are racist to me. I am trying to my granddaughters here and they are currently on a 9-year waiting list because they are trying to do it legally. My granddaughters are Asian.
@BeckyBTaylor @RepRaskin I wish I had the body to that. It looks like fun, but I doubt you find them at the border, especially trying to climb with backpacks. I know a lot of people think that the Wall will not any effect but when was the last time you jumped a wall while walking down the street?
@BeckyBTaylor @RepRaskin Why do we have walls around prisons? Why do Hollywood actors have walls around their houses? Do you have a wall or fence around your property? If so, why? The Wall is needed to stop or slow down the people who are bringing drugs over the border.
@BeckyBTaylor @RepRaskin You haven't tried to climb a wall lately, have you? I see this stuff all the time and many people actually think that these will easily happen.  The Wall proposed is not a small thing. You would really need a large ladder to climb (s0 ft or taller).
@lkdriessen @LindseyGrahamSC Must be a Democrat. Make the rich pay for everything. No, have the illegal aliens provide the money and labor to build the wall. They think they can just waltz over and do whatever they want. It needs to be stopped.
@LindseyGrahamSC Please stop giving drunken sailors a bad name.
@RepRaskin That is normal if you don't like it blame it on President Trump. He said he will accept the blame and I am proud that he does. Now it is your turn to stand up and provide for the security of the American people, not the illegal aliens.
@WhipHoyer @POTUS @TeamCavuto If you believe there is bipartisan support then fight to get it passed. Not enough votes is not a reason to not try.
@UCBerkeleyLib @UCBerkeley No learning or studying during the holidays.
@GavinNewsom FAKE NEWS. How did it cost billions? We could save money for not paying people who don't. As self-employed people do not pay me for not working. Now, how about you working for the American citizens and not the illegal aliens, bring back security and safety for Taxifornia.
@killakane604 @RepJayapal I understand Canadians do not have the same problems that Americans have. Having lived in Canada I know what it is like. The Wall is needed to slow down those trying to bring illegal items and people over the border. It will not stop them but it will deter most of them.
@killakane604 @RepJayapal Why do we have walls around prisons? Why do Hollywood actors have walls around their houses? Do you have a wall or fence around your property? IF so, why?
@RepBillFoster Wrong if we don't need walls then why are there walls around prisons?
@BretBaier We really need a law like that but hell hasn't frozen over yet.
@chuckwoolery A leader of his people.
@RepZoeLofgren FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS. Those working still get their pay. The ones who are furloughed will get back pay for getting an extra vacation.
@RepFrenchHill FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS. Many employees still working and get their pay. The ones who are furloughed will be paid when the government starts back up. Some of their banks will honor their debts during the shutdown. They get a paid vacation.
@elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS. Critical parts of the government are not shut down. Stop your lying and tell the truth! Explain what is really shut down.
@RepJayapal Jayapal, you are the mean one. Concentrate on your constituents. Stop working for the illegal aliens and start working for the American Citizens.
@RepJayapal There are a whole lot of people worried about their rent and food and it has nothing to do with a government shutdown. It has to do with high taxes, fees, and surcharges. Start concentrating on the security and safety of the American people. The Wall needs to be built.
@ChrisCoons FAKE NEWS - Significant parts of the of the federal government will shut down. That is a load of crap and you know it. Only non-essential parts of the government will shut down and you are one of them that is giving that part an extra holiday with pay. Quit trying to lie.
@IamAnneke1969 @RepTedDeutch Criminals will still break them, that is their job.
@CuteScarley yellow bedsheet and glittered leotards in high heels.
@Imamofpeace A religion of peace?
@JeffFlake @ChrisCoons What good does the climate do if we can't be secure in our own country? Get off the climate train and get the Wall built!
@IamAnneke1969 @RepTedDeutch Most laws are made to keep honest people honest. Occasional honest people will stray but a law, rule, tradition or even religion will keep them on the path of honesty. The truly criminal or desperate will tend to break the laws.
@BreitbartNews What about the slush fund used to pay off sexual allegations?
@chinabeach59 I know but had to try anyway.
@ArthurSchwartz Take that 4.8 for Mexico and put it toward the Wall. There Mexico would be helping pay for the Wall.
@RepAdamSmith @kasie @KasieDC The American Citizens of the United States need to have the last say - Build the Wall and Obey our laws!
@SenatorMenendez @nidhiprakash @BuzzFeedNews @SecretaryCarson Why give illegal aliens loans? No matter how you look at it they are here illegally and need to go through the same process as other immigrants. The first thing they need to do is get in line. The already have the privilege of being in the country when the should not be. No more.
@asims0808 @SarahPalinUSA Take away the WD-40!
@RepJimCosta @HispanicCaucus @CBP Are you going to stand with the European Caucus or the Asian Caucus? Everything is skewed toward the Hispanic or the black caucus but never toward the European or Asian caucus. Equal treatment, please.
@GameLabInc @RepTedDeutch Why are there so many people trying to immigrate here?
@GameLabInc @RepTedDeutch You can buy a gun on the streets of Los Angeles from another criminal for less than $50. Banning the guns will not make A change in that. They steal the guns and sell them. They are brought over the border for sale. AK47s are a big hit in that trade. The Wall will help stop that.
@SenTedCruz @Google Google's Chinese search engine project "effectively ended." Meaning they are ready to go online.
@SenKamalaHarris She died of natural causes and in that case, she would have died whether released or not. The other thing was she spent time in the infirmary under doctor's care, that may have prolonged her life a few days. Read the report.
@ChristusPatriot I wonder if the Democrats are viewing this video to find more votes they can get over here?
@V_of_Europe Well, there goes the taste.
@MartinHeinrich More of a hoax like the Clinton Foundation or Benghazi was because of a video. Even the scientist who worked on the first part of the climate change findings says their findings were skewed and were not accurate by about 40%.
@RadioFreeTom They said they don't "believe" his rights were violated. That leaves room for the fact they may have been violated.
@SarahPalinUSA what are James Comey's thoughts on this? Does he still stand behind the Christopher Steele dossier that he used but can barely remember? That is one sharp steel trap of a "mind."
@BFT_Podcast MSNBC "targeting" children? I thought they were all over Sarah Palin when she put up a bullseye sticker. The children of politicians need to be off limits. They should not be used as pawns until they are old enough to vote. This should be for all politicians.
@BFT_Podcast At least one that he hasn't groped.
@BFT_Podcast How is he going to prove it? Does he have a witness from 35 years ago?
@cnni Don't put glitter all over it, just give me the bare facts.
@BreitbartNews Does anyone really care about her facebook page? She became irrelevant without Sonny.
@RepTedDeutch It doesn't matter what you ban, people who want something they can get it on the black market. Border control such as the Wall would be better than just banning things. Criminals don't care about the laws till they get caught, and today's justice system just sets them free anyway
@AnnCoulter @FredHonnold If the Wall funding is off the table then we don't need a government to waste our money by showing up. Stay home and no pay till the wall is funded. Do not backpay. Anyone that loses money from the shutdown, put the blame on those who don't care about the security of the US.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Chuckie, you voted on the wall and funding before. You have now changed your "mind" because you want President Trump to look bad. You have no care about the American people just getting more voters by hook or crook and crook you are. Message: Build the wall, obey our laws.
@HotlineJosh Let the ones who think it would not be a tragedy lead the way. When you come back to let us know, we may follow you. Don't hold your breath, or maybe do if you want.
@ge_kaitlyn @BBCWorld Oh yeah, don't forget the Military Stars and Stripes News Service. They are mainly geared for the military and not always right leaning. Their radio service even has NPR on it.
@ge_kaitlyn @BBCWorld Not Fox News, BBC, KNN, NHK and other foreign language news. You would be amazed at what they say. Don't always listen to the English version, but listen in the native languages. It is definitely different.
@ge_kaitlyn @BBCWorld Proper walls will work, but not just the wall but also tech &amp; the main thing, boots on the ground. If the wall weren't a great deterrent then we would not have walls around prisons. We also have tech and guards with nice weapons. We also use FLIR Systems. All that together works.
@ge_kaitlyn @BBCWorld But we will waste in giving to nations who hate us. The wall is important to make it that much harder to cross into the US. There are many children who are being used as mules to carry drug here and when they get here they are sold into the sex trafficking scene. That is just one
@ge_kaitlyn @BBCWorld To be fair, it was supposed to have been completely funded years ago when it was authorized. Guess who would not fund it?
@BBCWorld We can get the military down there for the tunnels. We have plenty of experience from dealing with the North Koreans and the tunnels they had. Meanwhile, the wall will help stop the people who are forced to cross while carrying backpacks of drugs for the coyotes, &amp; some are kids.
@HillaryClinton Fake news with sour grapes added. By any means necessary. I wonder if the Washington Post helped them. Take a look into that for us, Hillary and let us, the American people know. Thanks, for your steadfast belief in whatever your mind thinks of.
@jordan327 I finally saw your tweent and I hope you do know most hispanic people are white by their DNA. Don't believe me, look it up. https://t.co/b1a8Jmim48
@CNN All challengers are welcome and may the BEST person win. If President Trump wins, Great, if not it had better be somebody better than him.
@JesseKellyDC All this information is from the article written and the website of the bar where the kid performed: 	Name: 3 Dollar Bill 	Address: 260 Meserole Street, Brooklyn, NY, 11206	Phone Number: 7183663031	Use it as you will - If it is incorrect, then correct it.
@RepBrianHiggins You passed it before we could find out what was in it and it was done by trickery. Now we know what was in it and the tricks are falling apart. Pelosi needs to be held accountable for the people who lost jobs because of the regulations.
@ChrisCoons I am PROUD to have President Trump shut down the government if the Democrats do not want to secure our border. It is upon the Democrats to fund it for our safety. if they don't want to fund the wall then the Democrats are the ones who don't want the American citizens to be safe.
@ChrisCoons My position is simple - no funds, no work.
@BreitbartNews And Alec Baldwin is another part of that curse.
@AlabamaAnglican @Dragon4941087 @BreitbartNews I know but the outside possibility is there. I don't want it to pass and we need to be on our toes to make sure something like this never happens. With all the other stuff that is overlooked by the "people" (loosely used) in charge makes me concerned, what will they do next?
@TheDemocrats Shut it down till you fund the wall. Our (the citizens of America) comes before any illegal alien. The Government has the obligation to secure our safety and if it means building a wall then so be it. Build the wall!
@AlabamaAnglican @Dragon4941087 @BreitbartNews If the Democrats brought the bill forward and it passed all the way to President Trump. If he vetoed it the Democrats would try and override that veto by any means necessary. Unfortunately.
@phildstewart This happened in a war zone, not the confines of the US. Let the military handle it not the civilian courts.
@Dragon4941087 @BreitbartNews They may be able to override a veto.
@BreitbartNews What else are they going to criminalize if we don't have government permission? They are trying to control up a little bit at a time. First guns, then sharia law, then speech ... where will it end?
@charliekirk11 Biological markers checks can answer any questions and that should whether they are allowed to compete. Tired of the "I feel like a...  movement." Are you or are not, that is the answer. You can dress however you want but don't force yourself onto others.
@USCIS @USDOL @DHSgov I am tired of hearing about H-2b Visas and illegal alien migrants, what about the regular person trying to get here legally? When are you going to speed up that process? You have expedited handling for H-2B but what about children who are trying to get here before they are adults
@theblaze Ok, I want a fat Barbie and fat Ken, then I want a trailer park/ghetto  Barbie and Ken. The I want Barbie and Ken with different prosthetics. While we are at it an old Barbie and Ken in Wheelchairs and with walkers. Then finally ones hooked up to life-sustaining equip. Too far?
@Yousefzadeh Creepy porn lawyer?
@chinabeach59 @chicksonright @outdoorsygal35 I do give a sh** so I can flush it.
@Ocasio2018 I thought you were going to give everybody free insurance?
@RealJamesWoods More to come. Taxifornia is now trying to tax texts and backdate it for 5 years so they can buy the poor cell phones. That is what I have heard on the local radio stations so far. What else are they going to do to the taxpayers? Are they trying to run taxpayers out of the state?
@KatTimpf We know what he has been watching!
@cnni Back to grade school for her.
@RepJoeKennedy Fake News and deflection strike again. Why is it politicians on the left like to change the facts just a smidge so it sounds like CBP is the bad guy or that our President is doing something wrong trying to protect the nation?
@RepBillFoster We need something to happen, we cannot even get one VA Hospital to talk to another VA Hospital. If they do it is usually out of date. My primary Physician should be able to pull up any and all procedures that were done at another VA Hospital but they can't.
@NitaLowey Was the girl already suffering from dehydration when the CBP found them? I do not believe for one minute that the CBP would cause the dehydration of anybody and to insinuate so is completely wrong. For a politician to suggest so is only serving themselves and not the country. 2/2
@NitaLowey Deflect, insinuate, those are the tactics of the left. Put the blame on the father who did not want to obey our laws and in breaking the law it cost him his daughter's life. Let us get down the nitty-gritty, what was the condition of the girl when they were picked up by CBP? 1/2
@RepJoeKennedy The father made a conscious decision to come here illegally &amp; it cost him his daughters life. We need to put the blame where it should be. If he did things correctly she would still be alive. A wall will help others hopefully make better decisions. Build the wall obey our laws.
@BreitbartNews EPA needs to check on Joy Behar for polluting the air and the air waves.
@RepJerryNadler @DHSgov @HouseJudiciary Why would the parents put their child through that?  Coming across illegally and putting the children through that hardship is what the parents need to stop. If they want to do it to themselves then fine, don't do it to the children. Wall could have stopped them. Build the wall.
@plgoarmy6790 @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump I get my facts from first-hand knowledge and like that Grape Koolaid or sometimes cherry. Most of my family and friends are immigrants so I understand what they are going through.
@RepEBJ Have you brought up any legislation yet to stop the global warming on Mars so the polar caps will remain? It is reported they are getting smaller.
@charliekirk11 They caught her supplier.
@cnni Wells Fargo also has been charging overdraft fees on checking accounts that have a positive balance. They try to explain it away with some fancy mumbo-jumbo that does not pass the smell test.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Many of the immigrants are not sure of the difference between the Republicans and the Democrats, but when it is explained to them they like the Republicans more. Teddy boy, President has been hating on the illegal aliens, not the immigrants who came here legally. Quit fake news.
@washingtonpost She wants charges dropped because she did not make a good decision at her young age. she 27 or 28, tough, old enough to know better. She is now 33 and her charges were in 2013, 5 years ago. You are an adult at 18.
@J50588 @mariasophianm @MartinHeinrich We need to poll this.
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump I swear they have already paid through a secretary of state who now dancing in India. Aw, the good times!
@redsteeze Don't forget Hillary was linked to Trump at some time or another.
@cnni And?
@RepLoisFrankel @POTUS What a load of crap! quit putting it out that everything is harmful to the "most" vulnerable among us. CHildren, seniors, and low -income. I fall in 2 of those 3 and I have found that the costs and regulation are more hurtful than the pollution itself. I am tired of paying more.
@FresnoBee Why do the barely poor have to for the poor to have cell phone service? Tired of paying for them, let them get a job and pay for it themselves. If you say there are no jobs then you are wrong. Jobs are there but you have to work and that is the problem, They don't want to work!
@MartinHeinrich Chuckie, when did President Trump say he wants to throw a temper tantrum? Why do you lie like that? President Trump never said he wants to throw a temper tantrum. Fake News, a Liar, tell the truth, President Trump never said he wants to throw a temper tantrum.
@CNN @niaCNN I didn't hear a roar, I did, however, hear nagging from both Nancy and Chuckie. Chuckie said, "the experts" who are his Experts? nancy said it couldn't be passed, Ha! Nancy, there is still time for you to go home for Christmas and stay there.
@JuliaBrownley26 Global community but not the American people in Taxifornia. You were elected to serve the American people, not the global community. We were not asked if we wanted to join the "global community" on some idea that would put us last in everything.
@Ocasio2018 We don't have to do anything, you prove it yourself.
@mariasophianm @J50588 @MartinHeinrich Do you want the Wall?
@RealJamesWoods Do you think Hillary and John will stay there?
@SenKamalaHarris We the people of Taxifornia are not honored.
@SenSchumer @SenKamalaHarris How did she "earn" that spot?
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Since you don't want to work with the President then you deserve everything that happens. I love how you try to throw everything back at President Trump when you are stubborn. You said the experts say we don't need a wall, are those experts out there patrolling? Build the wall!
@AGBecerra @EPAAWheeler @EPA When are you going to start worrying about the banks in your state? I have seen it where Wells Fargo is now charging their customers overdraft fees while the accounts are still to the positive. Start there and work for the people. If you want clean air Go Nuclear!
@SenatorMenendez Fake News, Liar, other such nonsense. The administration is not bringing down the immigrant community. The administration is trying to curb the illegal aliens overrunning our land. Pull your head out and start working for the American people and those allowed to be here!
@SenatorMenendez Immigrants yes, illegal aliens no.
@RepBobbyRush Talk about children, Poor Bobby didn't listen to the entire conversation. Who controls what? Go back and listen this time. Pelosi is not always right, and this time we don't have to pass it to find out.
@RepBobbyRush President Trump offered a DACA Deal with the Border wall but the Democrats didn't want that. it is the Democrats who don't want to protect the American people. They will work together with the GOP to get things done. It is their way or they start blaming President Trump.
@quarklesparkle @RepMikeQuigley We can go all day, Build the wall, obey our laws. OWG
@MartinHeinrich There are many ways we can have Mexico pay for the wall. cut back on the money we give them till it is fully funded. Charge more at the borders till the wall is fully paid for. Charge Western Union and other such money transfers a percentage of what is being transferred to Mexico
@MartinHeinrich I am proud to support President Trump in this effort. New Mexico may not want it but most of the American citizens want it. Is New Mexico part of the US? Some people in Washington DC don't think so.
@DanielDadler970 @NydiaVelazquez @NancyPelosi The only problem is that some court said that Obama's EO cannot be allowed to expire, which is what President Trump was letting it do. I still understand it and I am hoping it gets to SCOTUS and they rule on it and get it back on track to expire. DACA is unfair.
@RepMikeQuigley I say good, shut it down. If that is what it takes to get the wall then so be it. I heard Chuckie say that the experts said we don't need the wall, well those so-called experts don't have boots on the ground. The CBP says we need the wall and they are the ones there. Believe them
@Alyssa_Milano @RAICESTEXAS Blame it on the parents for not wanting to obey our laws and also putting their children at risk. Verify the children are theirs then send them back telling don’t try to come back, even legally. You cannot be trusted therefore we don’t want you.
@BreitbartNews what kind of teachers would do that?
@Ocasio2018 Protect American Citizens Build the Wall, Obey our laws. If the government shuts down so be it. Maybe Ocasio-Cortez will stay home. Congress needs to start protecting Americans, not illegal aliens.
@washingtonpost I hate to break this to you but it is just a fantasy movie and has no correlation to real life. Wasn't even that good. Get over it.
@RealErinCruz Unlike other countries she is free to leave anytime she wants. The sooner the better. I here Iran or Syria is looking for her. merry Christmas and may Santa give you a lump of coal. I believe you are oh his naughty list.
@doylejones1 @washingtonpost Love it, Straight to name calling and vulgarity. Nice to know who you are dealing with. You assume anybody who disagrees with and a member of the Democratic-backed KKK. Good luck.
@ChristineRange @lilbulli1031 @deneenborelli Correct, people seeking asylum do not wave their flags while rushing a border wall, invaders do. They all are now regular immigrants since they did not accept Mexicos offer of asylum.. Get in line and wait. Get out of the UN, Build the wall, Obey our laws.
@chinabeach59 PC SJW strikes again. Build a wall for the SJW. I see J's everywhere!
@chinabeach59 I would rate them in this order:	#3 Carter - for giving away the Panama Canal	#2 Clinton - I did not have sexual relations with that woman (and in the oval office)	#1 Obama - you didn't build that, the police acted stupidly, let's have a beer summit.
@doylejones1 @washingtonpost Sympathy for who? I don't have any sympathy for those who cover their faces while attacking others. Like the attacks on a reporter because he had an American flag, the attacks on the elderly because they would not follow their demands. I notice how you are an Antifa bot.
@doylejones1 @washingtonpost Not quite since I knew many WW2 veterans, they did not hide their faces and attack people who fly the American Flag or the elderly. The Antifa of today is sneaky little cowards who don't want people to know who they are otherwise they would show their faces. No denial about that.
@doylejones1 @washingtonpost In denial of what?
@JudicialWatch They are no longer asylum seekers, they refused Mexico's offer so now they are just standard immigrants. My granddaughters are on a 9-year waiting list, they should even longer than them because they haven't filed yet.
@washingtonpost Are you sure that wasn't an Antifa meeting?
@chinabeach59 Jeeez, all you rich people, I started out at .50 an hour then joined the military.
@Barbie572 @AMike4761 Nope, just need to find an island like on "Survivor's" and drop them off there. Give the satellite internet so they can watch what is going on and good luck with uploading.
@RepBarbaraLee What did he do to Congressman Wilson?
@MyBizNY @bankatronic1 @AMErikaNGIRL07 @Melissa98168063 Isn't that the same thing with Muslims?
@heavy_skunk @washingtonpost Here is a link to check out the information for Yosemite National Park. That is the park that I have been talking about because that is what is in my backyard. https://t.co/LjyvKay1VI	Please check it out. Thanks.
@washingtonpost Keep boy scouts for boys and girl scouts for girls. There are some things that they do share but not everything. We are losing our traditions. The scouts were a tradition now they are just another politically correct group trying to tear us down from the inside.
@RealCandaceO It seems like someone has it out for rich white people. At least they didn't say, rich white men, now we can lump Feinstein and Pelosi in that group of rich white people. Unsure about Warren. she hasn't decided what she is. Signed, poor old white guy.
@SenJeffMerkley @SenatorTimScott Every single person on the planet has some sort of bias against other races and sometimes including their own. Even you Mr. Scott. If you look closely at yourself you will find there is some racism in you. You can call everybody you don't like a racist &amp; yes, it is true. move on.
@AMike4761 Time to pull out of the UN and get it moved to an island along with all the migrants. Leave the UN, Build the wall and finally obey our laws.
@niti_mistry @RealCandaceO @edowning57 President Trump wants to completely defund Planned Parenthood. They say they are not using funding for abortion but that is a lie. When you free up money, you can use it on things you want.
@niti_mistry @RealCandaceO @edowning57 You should be protesting Planned Parenthood. They were founded to cut back on births by minorities. Don't believe me. Do some research. You can "google" it but it would be better if you found the history of planned parenthood in a library. Being in print is harder to change.
@BreitbartNews Some people will do anything to win, even if it is unfair to the other participants. Shame!
@SarahPalinUSA I am still trying to figure out how they can deny a lawful citizen that meets the age requirements to purchase a weapon that they have in their stores. If the law says 18 then it should be 18, not 21 because that is what the feel like selling it at. Unlawful age discrimination?
@SarahPalinUSA Did anybody expect anything else from this liar? He talks the talk but hides from the walk. Let get him out from behind closed doors and have him answer in front of the American people under oath and live. Beat him down like what was tried on Justice Kavanaugh.
@news6wkmg How can let Swalwell get anywhere near the nuclear football? He has already shown himself to be hotheaded over the rights of the American citizens. I don't want to be nuked.
@heavy_skunk @washingtonpost This problem has been going on for decades. Poor forest management has allowed these trees to stay in place instead of being removed properly. These trees have served no real purpose other than fuel for forest fires and home for the invasive beetles.
@KassyDillon I hate to say it but much of it has to do with entitlement and lack of personal responsibility. Many of the people ending up there just know they can get away with almost everything and don't have to worry about the consequences.
@AMike4761 Good
@SarahPalinUSA They have been going to South Korea and many of the citizens there are pissed and demanding their government do something about it.
@BigDaddyVato @w_terrence I have that same problem. Rise up, sit down and shut up and pay the bill says some politician from Hawaii.
@washingtonpost If this is Yosemite then many of those dead trees are the result of a beetle infestation. They have not been cleaning out the dead trees so the infestation keeps spreading.
@CR @RMConservative not every immigrant trying to come here is going for the welfare programs. I am trying to get my grandkids here to be with their grandparents, not for the welfare. We are trying to do it legally and they are currently on a 9-year waiting list. Where is our help for speeding it up
@freedom_moates Please Do not call her a "Bitch" the dogs are getting upset being associated with her.
@derekmaltz_sr @holliesmckay And the Democrats don't want the wall built. Sad, so sad. Protect the US get the wall built ASAP and arm the military to prevent this from coming further north.
@BreakingNLive Just acting like a target to zero in the weapons.
@tedlieu You have never read about the Salem witch trials, have you?
@BreitbartNews He is not finished yet. The one thing that is holding him up quite a bit is the Taxifornias 9th Court of Jesters, or is it the 9th Circus of Fools. If they would do their job according to the constitution then we would have a lot more sanity in the country.
@TwitterMoments What has happened to the death penalty? There are times we need to have it back and used properly it is a deterrent and a real punishment.
@MatlockFletcher The left and others are trying to steal our traditions. It needs to stop. If you don't like a song or movie don't listen or watch. That is what the volume and power buttons are for. Merry Christmas!
@CNN Do they sell it in America? That does not look like an American license plate.
@Ocasio2018 If you won't have the power then why say it? The way you are going we don't have to worry pet rocks will never get that power. The other thing noticed over the last few months is that subpoenas from Congress have no real meaning anymore. Everybody ignores them without fear.
@EasyMode423 @Ocasio2018 All hail Spellchecker!
@BreitbartNews Dang it, now Taxifornia is going to raise the gas tax again.
@RepJimCosta @DHSgov @CBP I say give them more tear gas and Jim why don't you start working for the citizen in your district and not the aliens trying to get into the country. The American citizen needs representation. You should have conceded to Elizabeth Heng.
@RepAdamSmith It is only misguided because you don't like it. Well, I like it and it needs to continue until our borders are safe and there are no more illegals running around the country.
@RepAdamSmith Having been a serviceman I would have loved defending our borders &amp; not someone else's, besides the people trying to enter illegally are not asylum seekers. Mexico offered asylum &amp; they refused now they are invaders. watch them as they climb over the wall. There is no door there.
@RepAdamSmith BS all the way. Detaining criminals (the ones who enter illegally) is not inhumane. we do it all the time to our own. You do the crime you do the time. It is costlier to let criminals roam the streets no telling what they will do especially when we don't know who they are.
@RepHastingsFL @EleanorNorton What about the Republicans in Taxifornia? Don't they need to have a say also? There was an initiative on the ballot but it was removed because an environmental group opposed it. Shouldn't we have had a chance to become a separate state also? Where is our equal treatment?
@SenWarren @fema @realDonaldTrump @DHSOIG Notice how easy it is for her to use our money with no real thought of how it is going to be done. Tired of such crap. Who is paying for the companies to do the work, US? We might as well hire American companies to do the work so the money comes back to the country.
@SenWarren @fema @realDonaldTrump @DHSOIG What about companies that have ties to the Clinton Foundation?
@NydiaVelazquez @NancyPelosi You are correct there should be no quid pro quo. Let DACA expire and build the wall. Obey the laws.
@NydiaVelazquez @NancyPelosi Are they here illegally? what about those who have been waiting for years to come here legally? Why are they passed over for those who break our laws? It is not our fault that the parents are criminals. If you steal a car to take your kids to school do you get to keep it? No.
@Molineaux50 @LouDobbs @BreitbartNews I don't know what it is like where you are, but out here in Taxifornia it is true. They are including both illegal and illegal in their studies. I know they say illegal cannot get aid but they are out here. They get aid using their children through WIC and welfare.
@BreitbartNews And this is news why? How many mothers, wives, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, and lovers have told a service member they miss them and you never covered that. Some singer says she misses a former president and the news wires go crazy. What are they, lovers or something?
@CNN PETA is synonymous with terrorism.
@CR Is that a prison? It looks better than some hotels I have stayed at. I don't understand why the politicians want to subject the public to prisoners who have not paid the full price to the public. There is no penalty for committing crimes, especially in Taxifornia.
@Nigel_Farage That document needs to be stopped. It may sound good because it does use a lot of feel-good words and phrasing but it not good for the country that is being invaded by the migrants. Every country needs to be able to determine who they let in and how.
@benshapiro Where is Jimmy Carter?
@ElizabethHeng We need to keep our traditions &amp; ceremonies. Too many people are trying to get rid of the traditions that we do have &amp; it is hurting the nation. The ceremony for the late President is one of them. Saying Merry Christmas is another. Keep our traditions as they are part of America.
@charliekirk11 Many shots were fired but the public has never been told about them. There was a reason it was called the cold war.
@BreitbartNews Are they going to make it illegal for criminals to use guns? Oh wait a minute, it already is. The laws are there, they are just being enforced correctly. Once a person is convicted of a crime they need to punished accordingly. Killers need to be punished not hugged.
@BBCWorld Love that bobblehead by Hillary Clinton. No greeting just a bobblehead that takes a while to stop.
@washingtonpost 2/2 my granddaughters and their father are on a 9-year waiting list. When are you going to work on that? It is ridiculous and "racist" because you are putting your first efforts toward Hispanics and telling the Asians they have to wait. The line jumpers are getting a break.
@washingtonpost 1/2 To hell with those "Asylum Seekers." Mexico offered them asylum but the turned it down so that should change their status to immigrants. Since they would not be immigrant they need to try to come in correctly. The tech unit needs to work on those who are in line already.
@Molineaux50 @LouDobbs @BreitbartNews Absurd, but true.
@LouDobbs @BreitbartNews No argument there, see it every day. Build the wall and obey the laws.
@AaronBlake 1st Worst  Obama - They acted stupidly, You did not build that.	2nd Worst - Clinton - I did not have sexual relations with that woman and the oval office - come on!	3rd Worst - Carter - Gave away the Panama Canal.
@NateOnTheHill Don't forget Carter,l he was there also.
@MarkDice I hope she is on birth control.
@RealJamesWoods Almost as bad as when the customers started yelling put it back on at a strip bar.
@RepJayapal 3/4 Americans, not even 3/4 of the immigrants are with you.
@BreitbartNews Stop it, you know it is difficult for you to think. You need your remaining brain cells so you can breathe.
@w_terrence Actually, it almost looks like San Francisco or getting close to it. This is what happens when you don't know who is coming into your country.
@BreitbartNews How many cars do you have, planes do you fly, houses to heat? Have you thought about going green and riding horses and in coaches, no planes and cooking over a wood stove while you heat your home? Oh wait, do not burn wood, try solar ovens.
@RealJamesWoods Taxifornia is doing its part by trying to make large company boards must have women on the board. Not a suggestion but a requirement. Time to move out of Taxifornia.
@BreitbartNews They don't have a helmet big enough for his head. That is not hair just a swollen head.
@tedlieu Have you thought about going back to prosecuting? Think about it, please.
@chuckwoolery Are those canine teeth getting longer?
@chuckwoolery The eyeballs, the eyeballs. How does she hold them in?
@TheDemocrats How are you going to force people into believing something? Is torture involved? "We cannot allow" what are you? How do suggest that? Are you going to pass a law?
@BreitbartNews Do you think they had a beer summit?
@b1joe @RealJamesWoods I wonder if her eyeballs will actually pop out?
@AGBecerra That is normal Taxifornia is the number one sue me sue you state anyway so your suits are frivolous.
@SenKamalaHarris We are not proud that you are our "spokes hole."
@SenSherrodBrown @realDonaldTrump There should be a way to force GM to pay all their workers who they plan to lay off for at least 3 full years at full pay or we will recoup the money that loaned to them immediately. We the people have bailed out too many companies just to have them thumb their noses at us.
@Ocasio2018 Where is the money coming from? How come the others don't pay their interns? Are you going to pay them a Washington DC living wage?
@maziehirono I looked all over and have not seen any Muslim ban? Where in the laws is that? Please reference the exact law and language that makes anything a Muslim ban?
@C0LBERTISMYHER0 @Acosta And she keeps on going and going.
@Acosta Hey Jim, do you have that report on Hillary Clinton's Foundation yet?
@BreitbartNews Quit, Please quit. It would a much better show without you.
@BreitbartNews Suffering through tear gas is a part of military training and causes no permanent harm. Let them know they are not wanted here if they cannot abide by our laws. Protect the borders, build the wall and obey the laws.
@BreitbartNews Nobody has paid him enough for it to be a good policy.
@RepJayapal @nybooks Ok, I will say it. Get your tail back to Washington and work for the people who elected you not the migrants who can find their own lawyer to represent them to file to come here like any other immigrant. They are not asylum seekers anymore.
@SenSanders @Ocasio2018 Ok, Let us be courageous. Get the illegal aliens out of here so that we will have more jobs for the American citizens. If you don't want to work then no welfare. Drug test for all on welfare. Voter ID for all wanting to vote. You don't have an ID, why not?
@amanda_farnan @Ocasio2018 How much is she charging to speak? Has she met with Hillary for strategy sessions yet on raising funds? Before she leaps she needs to take a look at what Hillary is charging for Her and Bills current speaking tour. As low as $7 a seat and still have empty seats.
@BreitbartNews I am surprised she didn't blame President Trump for his death.
@chuckwoolery Was that woman a democrat? Maybe an SJW.
@GmaG54499212 @GovMikeHuckabee Don't forget Obama who visited all 57 states. The one who could not tell the difference in the pronunciation of corps versus corpse.
@CatalinaAndOleo A regular immigrant is one who comes into the country the correct way. Not sneaking across the border or lying about their status or anything in their character. They can apply to come here but it does not mean they will be accepted. BTW are you going to sponsor anyone?
@CatalinaAndOleo I am not talking about citizenship I am talking about immigrating into the country. As far as Lou Dobbs hiring, then at least I would have a job.
@GovMikeHuckabee I thought she 3 chambers of government. She is going to rank right up there with the congressman who was afraid Guam would flip over if too many people went to one side. Or may the one who thought sunspots were caused by climate change here on the earth.
@CatalinaAndOleo As I said before if they refused asylum in Mexico then they are now regular immigrants and they need to get in line like everyone else in the world. Mexico is not as bad as people say. There are bad places just like in the US but not everywhere.
@CatalinaAndOleo If they are in such dire straights why didn't they take the asylum Mexico offered? They could have gone south of Honduras to other safe countries. Don't give me that attitude of I got mine so screw everyone else. The ones coming in illegally are the ones saying screw you.
@CatalinaAndOleo Coming into the country is an illegal act. You don't want to see what I am saying. I am trying to get my granddaughters here and they are on a 9-year waiting list just for the paperwork to be examined so yes, I am pissed about people jumping the line ahead of them.
@BreitbartNews Has he done anything worthy of the Pro-Bowl other than knowing how to kneel? I guess that would be good for the huddle and that is about it. Maybe place kick holder? Anything else?
@CatalinaAndOleo Countries are bidding on them. They are just willing to take them. The US does not have to give them asylum. Many are looking for jobs, not asylum.
@CatalinaAndOleo @damianaswan @RepJayapal International law - Mexico offered them asylum but they refused so now their status changes. They are now immigrants, no longer asylum seekers. Now it is time for them to get in line and wait just like any other immigrant trying to come to the US.
@RayAppletonKMJ I think he just likes that "sick" feeling he gets around 11 AM Mon thru Fri. I  know I do.
@Harlan This is one of the reasons we join and fight.
@No_2_PC @SenWarren @HouseDemocrats Where in the Congressional burning at the stake? Bring all the evidence forward so we can have the # Metoo go after him as they did with the innocent man, Justice Kavanaugh.
@Quigs8816 @Ocasio2018 My mother was a military wife and we moved a lot. Even though she would work at the various bases she did not get enough credits to reach that 40 credit mark so she never received Social Security even when she was disabled. Why does a refugee get it &amp; an American citizen doesn't?
@Quigs8816 @Ocasio2018 Let's say you paid into the system but you only made the 35 credit mark because you chose to stay home and raise kids. You don't get Social Security even though for those 35 credits you paid.
@Quigs8816 @Ocasio2018 It would be better if only those who pay into the system get it. There are American citizens who do make the 40 credit mark who do not get anything even though when they worked they did pay into the system. Like I said there are refugees who paid nothing and get it.
@Comey Have you noticed most of your supporters are women? Must be your good looks because it is not your character.
@Comey No, when you finish with the closed-door session you can come out do what you did before - leak it. You have done it before so you can do it again if you really believe in transparency. If what you leak is wrong then the official documents will come out.
@RepJimCosta @lopezobrador_ 2/2 They were offered asylum by Mexico but refused it so that would change their status to just regular immigrants. Asylum seekers are should take refuge in the first country that offers it to them. If they decline and want to come here then get in line like any other immigrant.
@RepJimCosta @lopezobrador_ 1/2 Your office told me last Thursday that you have no effect on immigration. could it be that they are lying to me? I want to see those that are waiting in line now are ahead of those showing up at the border. Those at the border are no longer asylum seekers.
@USCIS 2/2  If this is true does it apply to all of Congress? If not then since they won't help with people trying to get here legally then they should no influence on anybody including illegal aliens, sick, refugees and other such immigrants. Hold them to what they say.
@USCIS 1/2 Can you please explain how an earthquake in Alaska affects the processing time in Taxifornia? How can we get some of the petitions moved other service centers that are not so busy? I was told by Congressman Jim Costa's office that they have no ability to help with immigration
@SenWarren @HouseDemocrats Great, are they going to start with themselves? People like Nacy Pelosi, Dianne Feinstein, Maxine Waters, Cory Booker, and others? Each one of the should be held up just like Justice Kavanaugh and scrutinized all the way back to their time in cribs.
@Quigs8816 @Ocasio2018 We could probably have had more on Social Security if we were not giving it people who never paid into the system like some refugees. Yes, some of them do get Social Security even though they never paid into it. There are American Citizens who cannot get Social Security.
@Quigs8816 @Ocasio2018 Congress controls my fixed income (Social Security Disability) so I can truthfully say it did not help me much. The last time we got a raise the cost of Medicaid went up also equaling no increase, in fact, some went down a bit.
@Quigs8816 @Ocasio2018 Don't forget some of the richest are in Congress. Look at Maxine Waters and Dianne Feinstein. Not only are they helping themselves but also their families. BTW many of the companies used the savings to update equipment and make repairs that were long overdue.
@RepJayapal How much money did Hillary Clinton or the Clinton Foundation receive for help from her husband, Bill Clinton? Does anybody really know or has it been laundered also? Maybe we should ask the Russians? They seem to have done a lot of business with the Clintons. Uranium anyone?
@washingtonpost BFD my granddaughters are on a 9-year waiting list just to have their paperwork examed for possible immigration to the US. Migrants showing up at the border are trying to jump the line. File and then wait your turn. You are not asylum seekers, just immigrants. Mexico offered.
@Ocasio2018 Could it be that many of the companies are held back in giving help because of the regulation put in place by the government? Would you want to be sued for trying to help? Maybe if you change or eliminate some of these regulations &amp; laws more people could get the help they need.
@bdomenech Fox News has reported on it. So far what I have seen is that the French are protesting higher gas taxes which were raised by the government. The French President has used the excuse of climate change to force everyone into using less gas by raising the gas taxes.
@StephenKing Why the interest in sex?
@LisaMei62 Can we say that the police threatened to arrest "journalist" for recording the action of Antifa? What about the actions of Antifa why aren't arrested for threatening citizen walking on the sidewalk? Mr. Mayor, police chief where are you? Hiding behind your desks.
@RayAppletonKMJ My Condolences.
@CNN People will buy anything on sale. Years ago a grocery store had green bean in a can for 23 cents but they were not selling. They put the green beans "on Sale" for 4 for a dollar (25 cents a can) and they almost sold out. People are not using their brains for buying things.
@charliekirk11 She needs to also be charged aiding and abetting criminals. If she helped any of them vote that needs to be dealt with also. Both for the attorney and illegal alien. We need to go after the illegal voter with a vengeance. It is our country, not theirs. Build Wall, Obey Laws.
@MeetThePress @RepJerryNadler @chucktodd I hate to break it to you but Hillary Clinton did not get elected President. I know she does lie to everybody and misleads them but she is not the president.
@charliekirk11 Taxifornia leads the way in stupid laws. Jail time for saying the wrong gender, and what about plastic straws. We had to get rid of bags at the grocery stores, but you now buy them. In fact, those on EBT get to charge them to their card. We are paying for people to buy bags.
@Ocasio2018 Well, fight to get rid of it and go on the same plan ordinary people have. Did you forget Congress gets to write their own laws? Time to grow up and get serious if you want to succeed. Not everything is pie in the sky like you believed, in fact, most everything is not. Obey Laws.
@IvankaTrump The Trump administration is working to combat human smuggling but the Democrats are encouraging it. The best to help stop it is the wall. A nice high physical barrier could stop or at least slow down the invaders long enough for the CBP to get there &amp; round them up. Build a wall.
@Comey Does this mean you are going, to tell the truth, this time? You did say without being in contempt. Why did you protect Hillary Clinton? Why did you leak information? Why didn't you do the job you were hired for without political leanings?
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump What do you know about the people? Your own state allows Antifa to disrupt traffic and assault seniors while you worry about the Atlantic. Start worrying about your own state first and once that is cleaned up then you can turn your attention to the rest of the US.
@JonahNRO The Catholic church has lost its way and needs an intervention. They need a Pope who will them back on the straight and narrow and teaches according to their doctrines and the Bible. They need to cut down their protests and start tending to the needs of their people.
@ByronYork She should have demanded a refund and donated the rest to the Republicans.
@ChabadLubavitch That guy needs to caught and fully prosecuted. He is a complete coward. Live PD please air this one.
@CNN My wife was treated like trash and I am still working on that. It was 5 years ago. She was a South Lake Tahoe when a local hit her car and then ran. She followed him and called 911. They did nothing to him and wouldn't even talk to her or anybody with her. They are all Asian.
@gdlittledorf @MikeLevinCA Even Buddhist know when they are getting a raw deal. Knowledge is power. The Democrats are not using the power they are using threats, intimidation and flat out lies to get what they want. Racist, misogyny, Nazi, climate deniers are words thrown around by the Democrats.
@MikeLevinCA How do we stop beach erosion? I hope you are not like one of your colleagues who wanted to know if climate change was affecting the Sun or another one who was concerned about Mars? Many of the original scientists now say their work was flawed. We need to go back and check that.
@damianaswan @RepJayapal Check your international laws on asylum. For asylum, they are supposed to go to the nearest country from where they started that offers them asylum not the country of their choosing. Mexico offered them asylum and since they refused their status then changes.
@nytimes That was a PC alert!
@nytimes And your point is?
@benshapiro Oh, shaitan! you are really going to shaitan him? That is going to be deep shaitan.
@damianaswan @RepJayapal It doesn't sound like she is trying to assist American citizens. They are not asylum seekers they are immigrants and according to the office of Jim Costa, they cannot help people get into the United States.
@RepJayapal @humanrights1st If they want to come here then they need to learn English. We don't need more who cannot speak our language.
@RepJayapal @AlOtroLado_Org No thanks to Congress who lie to the American people. You and Jim Costa.
@RepJayapal We are also a country of laws. Let them get in line just like everyone else who is looking for a better life. They are not asylum seekers because Mexico offered them asylum and the refused it. Now they are just immigrants trying to get into a country of their choosing. Obey laws.
@RepJayapal I cannot get an intervention on the help of getting my granddaughters here legally. My congressman (Jim Costa) has said there is nothing they can do. But yet here you are intervening for people who do not want to get in line!
@RepJayapal You did not say why they were denied, could it be they were caught sneaking into the country, you ILLEGALLY. Quit your job.
@RepJayapal Why are you assisting migrants, why not assist American citizens like you were elected to do. If you want to assist the migrants then resign your post and go to work for them!
@Krissaaay79 @BreitbartNews @brandondarby Portland and Seattle don't have pooty crews yet. That is a crew that goes around cleaning human feces off of the streets.
@w_terrence Some people just can't read, you are Uncle Terrence.
@FettGeo @AP wrong, they are the stone age.
@BreitbartNews @brandondarby It reminds of San Francisco, today
@ChrisMurphyCT And the migrants say they are coming here to flee the violence.
@sporduroy @JudicialWatch We can try.
@RepJayapal Have you visited any women's shelters in Washington state? Have you funded any men's shelters in Washington state? What about the American citizen? Have you been visiting them? Get back to work for your constituents! (Unless you think the migrants are your constituents)
@sporduroy @JudicialWatch Can we give him back to the migrants and have them do the justice to him but only if they go back.
@JaniceMontalto @TheLibertyEagle In the constitution, it says the government will not play favorites with religion. It now appears the government is supporting Islam. Stop this! It appears Sharia Law is now trying to sneak its way into the American Judicial system. What are the penalties?
@JudicialWatch How is this going to stop the caravan? If he is a criminal then send him to jail, and make his brother pay for it.
@CNN Can we ban CNN in airports?
@keithellison So is beating up women a deterrent to equal justice.
@CR @benshapiro No, but it is the poor house for all.
@frankzepeda45 @SarahPalinUSA @JoyVBehar What has marriage got to do with this?
@SarahPalinUSA @JoyVBehar I still say the only ones insulted were the dogs. How do you think they feel by having Joy Behar lumped in with them?
I know I would if I were there. I went to local INS to find out where the best place to cross into the US from Mexico was but they would not tell me. On the second visit, the manager wanted to know if I was there causing trouble again. Yep! Why do illegals get away with it?
@Cernovich @ericswalwell I thought the lesson there was no Russian Collusion just that we're looking for Testi-lies. You tell us what we want no matter true or not and we will let you go.
@RepJayapal Are you planning on moving there? I hope so. What are you doing for your American constituents? Have you met with any of your constituents in Washington where their kids have Cerebral Palsy? Are you helping them? Worry about the American citizens before going any further.
@AMike4761 Too late, now they will be coming to the US as Canadian citizens. Trudeau is no friend of ours. How many illegal aliens were there in Canada? Did Trudeau know? I don't think so. Did Trudeau care? I don't think so.
@BBCWorld Should we ask a woman if she wants an engagement ring? Tired of listening to tweedledumbs.
@BreitbartNews Here is the problem with the moon or maybe it is correct. They say she is mooning the police following her, well she has her tail to the front windshield and her face to the rear. I guess that would be correct she does have her butt to the rear.
@BreitbartNews Kid Rock and Fox News need to apologize to the dogs for that insult.
@SenWarren @Marriott You are one to talk. Why did the government allow us to hacked by China &amp; got away with our names, SSAN, Bdays &amp; such for all those who have gone through the security clearance process? It was the OPM (Office of Personnel Management) Get your house in order before throwing rocks.
@SenJeffMerkley What happened 5 years ago? Or is it you think something happened five years ago? Maybe you just wished something had happened five years ago? Plans change, things happen just maybe not five years ago. Get over it and get back to work for the American People.
@The_MOE_Dome @w_terrence You should have seen me ordering KFC in Korea without speaking Korean.
@w_terrence Thank God, I even like fried okra every now and then.
@JacksonLeeTX18 @JoyceWhiteVance @HouseDemocrats @HouseJudDems @SenateDems Make sure she has a fire extinguisher nearby.
@HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi Is there any way we can say Goodbye?
@MillsZak @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump @LaraLeaTrump No, we don't need Bill or Hillary again.
@MAGATrumpster @LBaptisia @SenWhitehouse I know. It is sad what they do when trying to sneak into the US.
@Trump454545 I thought we already had that in San Francisco.
@ParisHimynameis @nathanluecking @WitchNectar @SGrobaski @realDonaldTrump I hope you are calling the so-called asylum seekers terrorist, I know I am talking about illegal aliens. The one who wants to sneak into the US and hide in our land. Those are the ones who need to be stopped. Not talking about the ones who show at ports of entry requesting asylum
@SenSanders Condemn them all you want, the truth hurts. They were trying to get into the country illegally and were throwing rocks. Do you want them in your hometown? If they can't obey the laws and use force to get their way we don't need or want them.
@nathanluecking @WitchNectar @ParisHimynameis @SGrobaski @realDonaldTrump Those "refugees" were offered asylum in Mexico but did not choose it so that would make them immigrants. They need to do it correctly or not try at all. The military is there to make sure our borders are secure, and Mexico is safer than where they came from.
@nathanluecking @WitchNectar @ParisHimynameis @SGrobaski @realDonaldTrump If you take a look back you see that most of the replies are about people trying to enter the country illegally. I have seen a lot of them and what some of them have done. We are talking about petty crimes but rape and murder. It is not a victims fantasy.
@ParisHimynameis @nathanluecking @SGrobaski @WitchNectar @realDonaldTrump Yes, I do, and I have fought for it.
@LBaptisia @MAGATrumpster @SenWhitehouse Not true, they were trying to invade but they were stopped. The children that were present were brought there by their parents. I guess it was a teachable moment for them. Invading 101. When the others started throwing rocks they were caught up in it. The parents were wrong.
@BBCWorld must have stowed away on a moving van.
@chinabeach59 @SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump I plan to be.
@nathanluecking @WitchNectar @ParisHimynameis @SGrobaski @realDonaldTrump Refugees and illegal aliens are two different things. Since you went from illegal aliens to refugees that is a standard tactic of deflection. Please don't confuse one with the other. Our prime complaint is the illegal aliens trying to run through our borders.
@SenKamalaHarris The bed hoping politician doesn't even want the central valley to build dams to store water in. That's right Kamala the central valley needs dams for water storage. Why don't you push that through? Jump right in &amp; start the dams so the central valley will have water to grow crops
@WitchNectar @nathanluecking @ParisHimynameis @SGrobaski @realDonaldTrump Nathan, do you think they are a victim fantasy. Sorry to disappoint you but do you really know the people that live you or the people sharing the road with you or even the people in your schools. How many are illegal aliens? What is their criminal background? Do you know?

@WitchNectar @nathanluecking @ParisHimynameis @SGrobaski @realDonaldTrump we need to Nathan all the victim fantasies we see. So hang tight for more fantasies.
@MollyJongFast Why the may? Don't they know for sure? If not ask his hairdresser.
@nathanluecking @WitchNectar @ParisHimynameis @SGrobaski @realDonaldTrump Hate to tell you but my family comes first. If they want to sneak in and get caught they deserve everything they get. If they want to try and come here legally I have no problem with that just obey our laws. BTW poverty is not an excuse for asylum.
@DRUDGE_REPORT it used to be you were an adult at 18 and had all the privileges of being one. Not any more. During my time I got my first shotgun at 12, my first drivers license at 14 and was running bars at 15. People grow faster and different in other countries.
@DRUDGE_REPORT So be it. keep them detained. We need to send them back to their parents. IF it takes years then it takes years but they should never be let loose into the country. I know heartless and all that crap. You think just because your little ones are still kids they are too. Not so.
@benshapiro Ga'ould
@washingtonpost @ErikWemple So you are saying you are trying to dictate what goes on at the Whitehouse. Are you going to start complaining if it doesn't go your way? So far I have found Ancient Aliens have more correct information and far more entertaining than MSNBC.
@cnni Why would we give asylum to Honduran flag waving seeker? If loves his country so much, go back and fight for it. We need to take pictures of all those trying to enter illegally and if they try to apply automatically deny them. Build the wall, obey our laws.
@CNN My question is; Why are the women trying to grow a mustache?
@eliseviebeck Ok, everybody, let him coach and do his thing. Leave the children out of any coverage other than the team scores. I hope he can coach like he used to and have fun with it.
@linda_lindylou @TheDemocrats I think that free pack should be in English but charge other languages. I try to get one Korean and it is like pulling teeth on a pit bull. Never able to a ballot in Korean but it is always Spanish. In order to become a US citizen, you must pass an English test.
@TheDemocrats I am still planning but I have called my local voter's registrar office and told them that I only want English on the voter information packet, no Spanish. I know many people that are sick and tired of trying to get through a package where Spanish is distributed in it.
@SpursCandle @chuckwoolery Please do not associate him with fat people, just associate him with scum and a few other things that start with s.
@chuckwoolery So they are now robbing people while they call them Nazis. Sounds like a bunch of common thugs that need to bring down about 20 pegs so they crawl up about 10 to reach street level. These people (used loosely) need to have shorts handed to them.
@dbongino He almost ranks up there with Pol Pot. Almost but not quite could be on the level with Ferdinand Marcos. I wonder if his wife has many shoes.
@SenSherrodBrown @realDonaldTrump Tell GM to support America. Bring their factories back to America. That would the best way to support the workers. Why give money to a company that is going to use it in another country. Those other countries already get aid from us. We don't need to backdoor them any more money.
@MikeHeron8 English would be the most apparent choice, So, make English the Official National language of the United States of America.
@MikeHeron8 Now that we are in this time and it would be impossible to go back (At least in real life, I know it happens in movies all the time) we need to have a language that is common to all of us. Since the constitution was written in English and most everything else is done in English.
@MikeHeron8 We eventually started doing treaties and buying land instead of just taking it. I know that some places in the world still just take it. Not much I can do about that, yet. Treaties were made with the Native Americans and yes some were bad and some were broken but they were made.
@MikeHeron8 In the time that Europeans (Including the Spanish) came over here the main way of getting land was through conquering others. The Native Americans also went to war with each other and took over their belongings. This was accepted all over.
@MikeHeron8 I know Mike you say that every time and you already know my answer. We can go one further, how about one language for all the "Native" tribes and for the rest of the people English. I know you want to say this whole land was Native Americans but no longer exists.
@MarkYoungTruth I wonder if some of there relatives are already here. I have seen on some of the cops shows where they using the kids to help steal stuff. Putting the items in kids backpacks, strollers and everything that the kids have. Raising a new wave of criminals.
@CR I don't know how to explain it to those idiots to think "White Christmas" was anything about race, it was about snow. Talk to God to have the color of snow changed. See you in church on Sunday while you pray for a different color of snow. Would red be ok? How about yellow? Black?
@CR Isn't Massachusetts another state where marijuana is legal? If so now I know why they apologizing, Too much smoke getting in their eyes and clouding their minds. Get over it dummies and lay off the weed.
@BreitbartNews Have them tell who they are and that they will obey our laws by applying to come here the correct way. Make English the Official Language of the United States.
@BreitbartNews Would you like it if a ram your house with a car to gain entry instead of just knocking at the door. This country is ours and we need to know who is coming here. Are they criminals or diseased? You say they are nice people so prove it.
@BreitbartNews I do not know why they would bring their children with other than to show them how to behave during riots. Trying to gain access to our country other than through a lawful port of entry is illegal and we need to keep the country safe and secure.
@BreitbartNews Nowhere in any picture did I see brains flying out of the heads of zombies. I did, however, see people rushing our southern border throwing rocks and other projectiles. They were waving their flags and some of them brought their children with them. Rocks can kill.
@SenWarren Can you explain what exactly did he do to make it harder for people of color to vote in North Carolina?
@michellemalkin Como esta. I know not Spanish but from the Philippines. Been there (Clark and Bagio) done that.
@RepJoeKennedy There are many jobs available in the US and with today capabilities you never far from the family like we were back in the age before the internet. It was rough, we had to pay for phone calls, there was sharing of video. We did have the photo though. We survived and so will you.
@RepJoeKennedy No more having to join a union, you can bargain for your wage and benefits. If you don't think you are getting paid enough hunt for another job. You are an indentured servant. If you have to move so be it. The military is looking good people.
@RepJoeKennedy Get rid of the high taxes, illegal aliens, onerous laws. Lower the living wage to you get what you deserve. People do not have the right to get a minimum wage. It is a law but not a right. They do have a right to work. They can work where they will hire them.
@RebekahWorsham Sorry about that got off a bit of a tangent, but yes welfare should not be easy to get and stay on. Drug tests and fingerprinting for all. (and now DNA Samples)
@RebekahWorsham 18/18  While most of the doctors are decent it is the hoops we have to jump through to get things done. That is my story and I am sticking to it. maybe I should write a suspense novel about VA care. Again, Thak You President Trump for the Whitehouse VA complaint line.
@RebekahWorsham 17/18  A little over 6 months to get these problems taken care of. Talking to some of the nurses and doctors they say these many people complain about the system I was told that the doctors that they send us to are same ones that most welfare patients are sent to.
@RebekahWorsham 16/18  We had to call the Choice program again for that and another appointment was made for another month out. The ankle doctor wanted to give me brace but that also not authorized by the Choice program. That got taken care of also.
@RebekahWorsham 15/18 The reason all this makes a difference is that the doctor the Choice program sends us to is that they will only do what they are contracted for. On the knee doctor, he went to give me the cortisone shot but they found out that there was no authorization for it.
@RebekahWorsham 14/18  I called the Whitehouse VA complaint line (Thank You President Trump) and gave them my story. Within 3 days I got a call back from the Choice program and had an appointment for me for my left ankle. Finally, they got it correct.
@RebekahWorsham 13/18 I got a call again and they said they had an appointment for right ankle now. The wrong side again. I told them and they said they would call back. Two days later they called and said they now have an appointment for my right ankle. Sheeeesh!!!! Attention to detail people.
@RebekahWorsham 12/18  About 4 days later I got a call back from them and they said they had an appointment for my right ankle. It was supposed to be for my Left ankle, the right had already been done. they said they would call me back.
@RebekahWorsham 11/18 It was another month and a half out. After I finally got all the appointment and went to them I needed to get a shot in my left ankle. I again called the Choice program and they said they would get one.
@RebekahWorsham 10/18  This doctor was a knee but did not do ankles. He gave me appoint but it was a month out. His office was also an hour away. I called the choice program again to get an appointment for my right ankle. They called back a few days later and said they had an appointment for me.
@RebekahWorsham 9/18  I called the doctors office and they said they had the consult and was going to give the Choice program a call about it. They had sent the consult to a spine doctor, not a knee doctor. Another 2 days later the Choice program called back and said they found another doctor.
@RebekahWorsham 8/18  I talked to them and requested the shots, they said they would give me a call back about it. I waited. 2 1/2 months later I finally called them back, they said they call me back again. Three days later they called and said they had sent the consult over to the doctor.
@RebekahWorsham 7/18  My example of this is my experience with the Choice program on problems with my knees and ankles. I requested an appointment at the VA to have a cortisone shot in my right knee and ankle. The VA said their doctor was no longer there. They sent me to the choice program.
@RebekahWorsham 6/18  If you want to use the Choice program you must first request it. Then they will try to find a participating doctor in your area (which can take up to 2 weeks) they next check with you (if they remember) then they finally make the appointment which is another 2 or 3 weeks.
@RebekahWorsham 5/18  Veterans get nowhere they same treatment or benefits the baby of an illegal alien gets. We get medical where there are long waits. They now have dental but you have to pay for that and the cost is higher than a member of Costco pays. The "choice" program is a joke.
@RebekahWorsham 4/18 It goes on and on no matter how many children the illegal alien has they get paid for each one. People will say it is not much but it is still more than they should get. American citizens do not the same treatment. The government needs to at the least treat people the same.
@RebekahWorsham 3/18  These babies have their mothers listed as their caregivers and then they need a place to stay and medical. Guess who pays for that. We do. Once they get a little older and still receiving welfare they go to school and again we are paying for that.
@RebekahWorsham 2/18 They then file for welfare WIC and everything else they are told they can file for. Many of the welfare benefits are limited by time &amp; number of children but these limits are not applied to them. Everything is filed under the child's name since they are now deemed American
@RebekahWorsham 1/18  Unfortunately, many illegal aliens are reaping the benefits of welfare. They technically don't get it themselves, it is for the anchor babies that they have thanks to us. First off when they sneak over the border and have a baby we pay for their hospital.
@marklutchman 2/2 If I don't comply with the drug test they told they would take away my medication. People on welfare ought to have to take a random drug test to make sure they are using the public money correctly. If they have enough to spend on drugs then they do not need welfare from us.
@marklutchman 1/2 Well as a veteran and using the VA, the people using welfare should at least have to put up with a little of what we do. If you are taking a prescribed opioid from the VA you are subject to random drug tests. I just had 2 in one month.
@repbenraylujan @Wilderness One way to clean up the methane releases is to remove all the dead trees and use them for building and whatever we used them for. Dead rotting trees release methane into the air. Environmentalists don't want the dead trees removed, leaving more to rot and more fuel for fires.
@RepLoisFrankel You forgot to tell that to the Democrats in Taxifornia. The only thing is doing with the money we pay in high taxes is giving it to illegal aliens for their lawyers and trying to build a high-speed rail to nowhere.
@RepJimRenacci I believe it is the god given duty of every taxpayer to pay the least they can. We need to stop giving more politicians money to play with. We need to fight back on every tax, fee and other methods the government uses to abscond with our money. Essentials first, then think.
@RepJoeKennedy @realDonaldTrump Have you personally gone down there &amp; asked the Border Patrol if they were targetting the kids. If not quit putting out Fake News. To people who look at other pictures of the same incident, it is obvious the people were rushing the fence &amp; throwing rocks while waving their flag.
@NYAPCdc Bring back morning prayers in school and personal responsibility in all areas of life. Common sense would also be nice. Remember the Golder is Do unto others as you would be done unto you. It is not Do unto others before they do unto you.
@NYAPCdc Can a Buddhist attend? It seems like most everyone Congress are Christians but yet we don't seem to want to get together. I suggest that we hold prayer sessions before each meeting including sub-meetings. Remind the people that we believe in the 10 Commandments.
@SenSanders Ok Bernie, how is this for suppression. Print federal ballots in English only! Do not print them in any other language unless you are going to print them in all languages. To become a US citizen you must pass an English test. Make English the Official Language of the US!
@BreitbartNews If it is true then good for him. We don't need to support companies that go to other countries. We already give the other countries aid and support, we don't need to give them backdoor support also.
@chinabeach59 Make English the official national language!
@chinabeach59 English is a requirement to become a citizen of the US. Why do we have federal voting ballots in Spanish? If they are going to provide ballots in Spanish they should provide them with every language on earth no matter how small the population in the area. Otherwise English only.
@chinabeach59 I am tired of going into stores and restaurants and unable to find people who speak English. I went to Golden Corral Buffet a few weeks back and asked one of the ladies there the butter was. I had to ask her several times before she went and got somebody who understood English.
@MarkSKrikorian Remember everybody, if the government gets shut down it is because the Democrats don't want to play.
@textualdeviance @RepAdamSmith The request is legal but you don't always get what you want. President Trump is trying to get so that you only request it at the access points, not when you get caught illegally entering the US.
@BreitbartNews A true dickhead!
@EmK__g @WitchNectar @realDonaldTrump What do you want to be done? If we let them come in and roam around the country waiting for their hearing 80 to 90 % do NOT show up for their hearing. It is better for us to not let them in. If they have no other place to go other than a refugee camp then so be it. Maybe go hiome
@RepAdamSmith The biggest thing that is broken about the immigration system is that the Democrats don't get their way. If people would obey the laws and come in correctly there would be no problem. Sneaking in is not the correct way. As far as tear gas goes, good. Build the wall, obey the laws
@RepHastingsFL @POTUS Got ahead and tell us about discrimination while you and your colleagues discriminate against us.
@RepHastingsFL @POTUS I went in overweight but it did not become an issue until after 5 years of Vietnam winding down. during Vietnam, they really didn't care about weight as long as you able to do the job. I was able to do my job the whole time but they didn't like my weight.
@RepHastingsFL @POTUS If you really believe that then what about people who are obese? We are discriminated against all the time even by the government. I don't see you out there fighting for us. I served in the military and then was kicked out after 10 years of service due to being overweight.
@Starscream @SenatorTomUdall @POTUS I know, but I want him to try and spell out what the harm is. Trying to get details our of a politician can be a lifelong job. I wish there was a way I could get paid for it.
@USRepKeating This picture is going tweeted over and over but it is not the only pictures out there for the same activity. You should show the one with the young men running toward the border waving the Honduran flag. I am sure that would be nice to see.
@MarkYoungTruth @Alyssa_Milano I hope Scope has contacted her about their mouthwash. She really needs to use it before she kisses another person. We have no real idea where that mouth has gone but know it wasn't clean.
@PattyMurray When my wife and I arrived in the US we were not allowed any form of public assistance for the first 5 years we were here and we did it legally. What assistance do legal immigrants get that my wife wasn't "entitled" to? If they are then we want those "entitlements" retroactively.
@SenatorTomUdall @POTUS Is it just New Mexico that is being harmed? Maybe other things are happening elsewhere. What harm is being done to New Mexico? You say New Mexico is being harmed but you don't give any details of what is going on?
@RealErinCruz @KamalaHarris I still have no idea why a bed-hopping politician like Kamala Harris would even be considered for President.
@RepBobbyRush Please explain how. We would like the information on how we are being harmed. Is it just America that needs to cut back or is it a world thing? Are we affecting Mars or the Sun like some politicians have thought?
@ChrisCoons Can you please give us a list of the scientists who are working the climate change information. I want to see their raw data if they have nothing to hide. We, the people, hear what is being said but many of us want to see the data. Is that too much to ask for?
@marxmythmaker @RepDianaDeGette next time I say my prayers I will let them know that you think my empathy is not good enough for you. What about the empathy from the parents toward their kids. Why do they put their children in harm's way? It is up to the parents to protect them and raise them right.
@corvalues @RepSwalwell I also understand it that if you were president you would nuke everyone who owned a gun. Guess why you are not president?
@RealJamesWoods It is not surprising that every guy will eventually be accused of sexual misconduct unless you are that woman from Florida who just got lock up for the second time in 14 months for beating up a guy because he would not have sex with her. She only had $100 bail. Where is equality?
@RepJoeKennedy But we meet invaders with our weapons. Get to know the difference. Asylum seekers and throwing stones, using children as shields and waving their flags in our face. Those are invaders.
@BreitbartNews You have no idea what you are talking about, as usual. How many chambers of government are there? How are you going to pay for medical? Do you even know what the holocaust was? Do you even know when it was?
@burghfan60 @BreitbartNews You said it, now you have to apologize to the dogs.
@LAcrimsonviking @CNN What do have against fat people?
@DRUDGE_REPORT Who really cares about him?
@amyinthelou @RepAnnWagner Today we call on the United States to make sure of the safety and security of those lawfully living here. What is a Leslie Knope? Is that a new sandwich spread or what?
@RepAnnWagner In some countries, it may be. Check on their laws before you make definite statements. You should have said I believe peaceful participation is not a crime but I don't know about Rwanda.
@RepDianaDeGette One other big note is: We do HAVE the RIGHT to protect our borders. If you don't think so let your constituents know and then resign. You are useless if you don't believe in the sovereignty of the United States of America.
@RepDianaDeGette Let us be even cleared, asylum seekers do NOT have the right to come into the country illegally. They can fill out their forms and wait in line like others trying to come here. It is BS they are seeking asylum, Mexico already offered it to them and they declined. Not our problem.
@RepDianaDeGette Blame the parents, they are the ones putting their own children in harm's way. Do not give in to their cowardly acts and let them in. Photograph everyone and compare that to all applications. If a match, then deny. Build the wall, obey the laws.
@benshapiro Is that a Honduran flag they are waving. Just like an invading army would do. BTW, many armies now have women and even children in their ranks. Pictures should be taken of everyone and then compared later to those applying for asylum or even immigration. If they match, deny them.
@SarahPalinUSA When are other news networks going to apologize for them airing comments saying that I was deplorable? They didn't apologize for that. Did they apologize for comparing President Trump to Hitler? No, they didn't.
@SarahPalinUSA descriptive comparison.
@Obi_wontaun @realDonaldTrump Sneaking through in the middle of the night is not a legal way to enter the country. It sounds like you still hiding in your mother's basement watching beta max tapes.
@nathanluecking @WitchNectar @ParisHimynameis @SGrobaski @realDonaldTrump In this case, it should be on Mexico to help them or kick them out. They invaded Mexicos southern border or maybe Mexico let them in. Either way, it up to Mexico. mexico did offer them asylum but for those the refused it they need to go back home. They could have taken the asylum
@nathanluecking @WitchNectar @ParisHimynameis @SGrobaski @realDonaldTrump We need to have it done correctly. My big complaint is that I do not want line jumpers or illegal aliens sneaking into the country. We don't know who they are or what diseases they may have. We don't know their criminal history or anything about them. We need to know for safety.
@ParisHimynameis @WitchNectar @nathanluecking @SGrobaski @realDonaldTrump I hope that wasn't a slam against immigrants. There is nothing wrong with immigrants but is something wrong with illegal aliens. Immigrants that apply correctly and make their way through the system and get accepted are welcome. Those who try to jump line or sneak in are not.
@nathanluecking @WitchNectar @realDonaldTrump You do know that anyone can go in and change what is on Wikipedia. I have done so myself. I would not take much stock in that. I would, however, try to find printed information. It is harder to change that way. Good for you trying to back up your statements. We need more of that.
@RepRichHudson I appreciate your offer to help. I wish all of the politicians in Washington DC would do the same. Those from Taxifornia would never do anything like that unless you are here illegally. Harris, Feinstein, and Costa don't want to take the time out of their day for US citizens.
@nathanluecking @SGrobaski @ParisHimynameis @WitchNectar @realDonaldTrump The people of Chicago could say that they are fleeing the oppression of the gangs that inhabit their city. If they seek asylum in Taxifornia it may be granted to them so their mo0ving fees and housing will all be paid for. The other option is to stay and fight the gangs.
@nathanluecking @SGrobaski @ParisHimynameis @WitchNectar @realDonaldTrump Feel good phrasing is like "a teachable moment" "he is a racist" "he is a Nazi" and other phrase designed to make the sayer feel like they have the upper hand. Fleeing oppression is one of those phrases. Maybe the people of Chicago need to use that phrase to get out of that city.
@nathanluecking @SGrobaski @ParisHimynameis @WitchNectar @realDonaldTrump The Hondurans are not stopping at the closest option. Mexico offered them asylum, they did not take it, so go back to Honduras. We are accommodating them as long as they do it legally. Not all seekers will be allowed in. It depends on many factors, but they cannot just sneak in.
@BreitbartNews Every time you say something bad about your opponent you are trying to discourage people from voting for them. What we need is a constitutional amendment to require positive proof of citizenship before voting. The real name with photo ID and verification of citizenship.
@ParisHimynameis @nathanluecking @SGrobaski @WitchNectar @realDonaldTrump Have you volunteered to lay down your life for the US?
@moconnmaine @Agt_USA @andonious @realDonaldTrump Don't read facebook. If they are fleeing a country they hate then why are they waving the Honduran flag? Usually, invading countries wave theirs with their troops. Why don't they stay and fight the crime and corruption?
@DRUDGE_REPORT Did she post a $100 dollar bond? If that is the real case why aren't men treated the same? He didn't give in to the demands for sex and assaulted him. Why is she hung out to dry as they would do to a man? Equal treatment, please.
@SenWhitehouse That is a nice poem that was put on the Statue of Liberty but it is not the law. The safety and security of the US must come ahead of the people who try to sneak in illegally. If they want to come here do it legally otherwise stay away. We do not need more criminals. Build a wall
@nathanluecking @SGrobaski @ParisHimynameis @WitchNectar @realDonaldTrump Flee oppression is another feel-good phrase being kicked around. When you flee oppression you cannot pick and choose which country you want. You go to the first country that will accept you. It is not your right to invade my country if another country has offered you asylum.
@EmK__g @WitchNectar @realDonaldTrump Let us be even cleared, asylum seekers do NOT have the right to come into the country illegally. They can fill out their forms and wait in line like others trying to come here. It is BS they are seeking asylum,  Mexico already offered it to them and they declined. Not our problem
@mdvagov Where's the cranberry sauce?
@SenJeffMerkley If you want clean energy that will last. Think about the way the French do nuclear energy. They use small neighborhood power plants. They refine the spent rods until there is practically no waste. We don't do that but we should.
@RepSarbanes On day 1 are you going to start building the wall to protect Americans? I doubt that. You will be doing something to gather more power and money around you instead of protecting the US. You have not listened to us in over a generation so why should we believe you now. Wall/laws
@NateMaddenCRTV I no longer see any of them with passion. I see parents willing to put their children in harm's way. I see men trying to invade my country by force or stealth, against the law. I see politicians favoring the illegal aliens over American citizens. Build the wall, obey the laws.
@dbongino I have a few questions for Schiff. When are you going back to work? Questioning an acting Atty Gen is not you were hired to do. You were hired to represent the people in the district for their safety and security. Are you working with President Trump toward that? Yes or No?
@Agt_USA @SGrobaski @phoenix081340 @realDonaldTrump 2/2 Since they declined asylum in Mexico they have shown they no longer need it. They want to come to the US for better jobs and they can apply for that but not as asylum seekers. They gave that up when they declined Mexicos offer. Build the wall, obey the laws.
@Agt_USA @SGrobaski @phoenix081340 @realDonaldTrump 1/2 Asking for asylum is legal but not guaranteed. The ones at the border now should automatically be denied asylum. By the UN charter, they were offered asylum and approx 2000 accepted it but the others say they want to come here. They no longer need asylum.
@SGrobaski @ParisHimynameis @nathanluecking @WitchNectar @realDonaldTrump Many of the Illegal Aliens crossing the border are the ones who are working off their "fees." The coyotes make them bring in drugs while charging them thousands of dollars. Some of the women are forced into prostitution along with their female children. Controlled by the coyotes.
@nathanluecking @SGrobaski @ParisHimynameis @WitchNectar @realDonaldTrump A majority of those that the US took in fought side-by-side with the American troops. They escaped Vietnam with their families and really nothing else. They are grateful to be here. Personal knowledge of the times.
@graham_monica @renato_mariotti Keep practicing, maybe one day you will get it right. People who try to sneak commit a crime. They even bring their kids with them. What kind of parents teaches their kids not to obey the law? We don't need those kinds of parents here, we have enough home grown criminals.
@renato_mariotti Getting the criminals while they are still committing misdemeanors is better than waiting for them to commit felonies. All illegal aliens are criminals. It doesn't matter how they act as long as they are here illegally they are criminals. Prosecute them.
@realDonaldTrump My mother, ex-wife, and wife are immigrants. My granddaughters are on a  9-year waiting list to come here. They are doing it legally. It has nothing to do with President Trump but has everything to do with them waiting in line like the true immigrants otherwise they are criminals
@POTUS My mother, ex-wife, and wife are immigrants. My granddaughters are on a  9-year waiting list to come here. They are doing it legally. They should wait in line like the true immigrants otherwise they are criminals
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump If you notice they are not an American citizen, heck they aren't even in America. We do have people in America that are in dire straights. Let's take care of them before we start with the rest of the world. Help should start at home first. Let us get our house in order.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Blame the parents for this. They are the ones willing to put their children in harm's way. Instead of teaching them respect for the law they are teaching them to do what you want. If they don't want to obey the laws then go somewhere else. We are a law-abiding country.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump My mother, ex-wife, and wife are immigrants. My granddaughters are on a  9-year waiting list to come here. They are doing it legally. It has nothing to do with President Trump but has everything to do with them waiting in line like the true immigrants otherwise they are criminals
@chuckwoolery Of course, when I was going through high school they kept saying we were going into an ice age. They also told us to get rid of paper bags because we were losing our trees. Now we can't have plastic or paper because they are destroying the environment.
@JessicaV_CIS @BreitbartNews Is it a Black Friday sale? We need to take them back and get refunds for them. That is a "gift" we don't really want. I hope Santa does not have a hand in this. Check Hollister Ca for some of them. The one with the Hollister T-shirt is a giveaway.
@SenatorMenendez Mendendez, we stand for civility and fairness and just because you don't like it does not mean you can do whatever you want! Build the wall and obey the laws. Those invaders are not doing that. Keep them out!
@SenatorMenendez My mother, ex-wife, and wife are immigrants. My granddaughters are on a 9-year waiting list to come here. They are doing it legally. It has nothing to do with President Trump but has everything to do with them waiting in line like the true immigrants otherwise they are criminals.
@SarahPalinUSA Alyssa, for every dollar you raise for the migrant invaders you need to give each American citizen 100 dollars. So raise a lot so you can give a lot. I hope this program they are doing is not a 501(c) organization. They need to be taxed as much as we can to support the government
@RepMarkTakano Let us be even cleared, asylum seekers do NOT have the right to come into the country illegally. They can fill out their forms and wait in line like others trying to come here. It is BS they are seeking asylum, Mexico already offered it to them and they declined. Not our problem.
@BreitbartNews 2024 is still open.
@redsteeze Who gave the order? The American people. Our country, obey our laws otherwise stay out, you are not welcome acting like thugs.
@womensmarch Another buzz phrase: crimes against humanity, toxic syndromes of all sorts, a teaching moment, racism, misogyny, nazi, and on and on. Trying to break into our country is illegal no matter how you try to cover it up. They need to be blocked, bring in more troops to protect borders
@womensmarch Watch Live PD and see how many of the lawbreakers are parents. Some of them even take their children with them as those in the caravans. Take your rose colored shades off and view what is going on, but have a bottle of brandy handy for what you have to get out of your mind.
@TOMS Why the representatives and not the people who are locked up for gun violence. Don't forget to send a card to their friends. You can pass all the laws you want but with the representatives that run Taxifornia and Chicago, it does no good. We need to really lock them up tight.
@RepSwalwell Swalwell, why do you get a pass? I do not want a nuke dropped on me!
@Alyssa_Milano What have we become? Something we should have been a long time ago, Defenders of our nation! Watching the news I have found out that even mothers can cause damage and break laws. Don't forget all the young men that are in that group. No coddling.
@Ocasio2018 I am willing to discuss anything you want! If you look at your fellow Democrats who call all President Trump supported deplorable's and a few other names I will not use. Don't forget everything that happens to them is a right-wing conspiracy. We know what to defend.
@slsmitty_ @washingtonpost Ok, what about a forced lottery of volunteers like we had in the past. It was called the draft for the military. That way only those who are not rich or like the current crop of politicians, not qualified enough for the jobs.
@washingtonpost Make them all volunteers, including staff and politicians.
@49ersRichdogg @RepSwalwell Did you say something? Or rather something of importance? That is what I thought. If he didn't mean it, then why did he say it? Go back to listening to your Professors at Fresno State, even though I know you won't learn anything from them. You were probably a Janz supporter.
@brandondarby I quit back in Dec 1996 and have been grouchy ever since.
@brandondarby I quit back in Dec 1996 and have grouchy ever since.
@chinabeach59 I want to see states not honor Drivers Licenses from states that give illegal aliens driver licenses. Taxifornia is not doing the illegal alien license correctly. It needs to have bigger lettering indicating the holder is an illegal alien.
@SenGillibrand Who is going to pay the health worker? What if the doctor doesn't want to work for free? Are you going to force them to work? What about the owners of the medical facilities? Are you going to make them give up their facilities? How much are we going to be taxed?
@yashar Don't want yours!
@greggutfeld We could always talk about Jim Acosta or maybe James Comey? Who would you suggest?
@washingtonpost What about the other people in that crash. Are they ok? Who caused the crash? Please let us know. I know people are all worried about their athletes, but there were other people involved and they may be just as loved.
@AngelVF @KS_Libertarian @RepSwalwell BTW the top 1% also employ people to work for them. They buy goods &amp; pay their taxes on those goods. They also shop for the better deals when they can. If you were buying a washing machine and it cost 10% more in one state than the other, where4 are going to buy it at? Luxury Tax
@AngelVF @KS_Libertarian @RepSwalwell Everybody yells about the top 1%, but I think that is jealousy. Calling the police for help is not socialism it is for safety and security. I will take capitalism over socialism any day of the week. I have personally seen what socialism will do to people, it is not pretty.
@FresnoBee @MarekTheBee We have perfectly healthy inmates that can do that. The police &amp; courts need to start enforcing that $1000 littering fine. Tom needs to be thanked but the government needs to get their act together on this blight. Don't forget not only does it look bad it also is fuel for fires.
@KS_Libertarian @AngelVF @RepSwalwell As I bot away. Not the first time I have been called a bot but oh well. BTW, Angel, a vote for the Democrats is a vote for socialism. Do you want others to take your earnings &amp; give it to those who don't want to work? That is what socialism is, a spreading out of unearned wealth.
@BreitbartNews I wish I could tell her face-to-face what an idiot she is. There is a line but they don't want to wait. My granddaughters are in that line and currently, there is a 9-year waiting list just to be seen. If the illegals don't like it, that is tough. They are no better than others.
@RepSwalwell Are you the one who wants to take away our guns or nuke us? Why did the founders put the 2nd amendment in the Constitution? Was it for food on the table or a tyrannical government?
@Bexmich @RepSwalwell He doesn't deserve it.
@RepSwalwell He is no longer a director. You should refer to him as Mr. if you already tried to nuke him.
@michellemalkin @LauraLoomer The truth hurts and that is why they get banned.
@AMike4761 God created man in his image and then made woman from the rib of a man. If that is the case then how come they say God is gender neutral? According to the bible God is male and woman is female. The Catholics are trying to change the Bible.
@TheJuanWilliams @realDonaldTrump If you are talking about not visiting the troops why should he put extra problems on the troops in the field by exposing himself to the enemy who would love to get him. It puts the troops into further harm. It is not a snub but you are a dud.
@SenGillibrand Are the medical workers going to be forced to work for free? Are the hospitals going to be forced to give up their buildings for free? Quit yakking and give us details.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Don't talk about groveling till you denounce Obama.
@SenSanders Is it the postal workers or the unio that is fighting against going private?
@RWPUSA Many people cared about it then and care about now. He was the laughing stock of the world. It wasn't that he did it but when and where. He was president at the time and in the oval office. The is the countries office and he disrespected it.
@HouseGOP Since the children are born into the military way of life should their time at home count as time toward military retirement? Should the military families at least be treated somewhat like illegal alien children.  If they get DACA then should time count toward retirement.
@JoWazzoo @AMike4761 That is exactly what is happening and it needs to be stopped. No matter what I say it is going to be called racist, but oh well, bring back American Values. Treat everyone equally until they prove they should not be.
@HoustonHealth @HoustonPubMedia All welfare recipients need to go through random drug tests while they are on public assistance. Veterans who have to take an opioid for pain has this requirement on them and if they don't comply they are told their medicine will be withheld. It has happened to me.
@HoustonHealth @HoustonPubMedia All immigrants need to be self-sufficient for at least the first five years. They need to have sponsors that will help them and make sure this happens. This is not something new, many people have been told that they will not receive public aid for the first five years.
@SenSchumer @SenateGOP I don't give a rat's tailbone, get the best person in there who can read and interpret the laws without a political bias.
@RepDonBeyer What if the people such as myself want Hillary and Comey investigated. Would I then be called a dictator? If so, so be it.
@SenWarren I thought the Senate was the ones who pass the budget? How does an outside agency sneak something into the budget? Do your job and vote for what is best for the American people. If you don't like it, don't approve it.
@dbongino Aren't cowards, must love President Trump and hate the "forgive us" Obama.
@SenFeinstein What would you do? Voting against something is like yelling in the wind. Nice but has no real effect. I want you to start standing up for the safety and security of the American Citizens like fully backing the wall and enforcing the laws.
@AMike4761 Why does she get special consideration? I want special consideration but I never get it. Make her abide by the rules of the House and if doesn't like them she can resign. Tired of hearing about special considerations because of their religion, color or sexual leanings.
@AMike4761 Make sure she gets no special considerations for her sex or religion. If she doesn't like that she can always resign and go elsewhere. The women of America should be very concerned. I worry for those that believe in self-determination and freedom.
@FrankPallone @realDonaldTrump You don't say why Turkey wants him extradited. You say a convoluted plan but that is all. More details, please. You also said your administration, well, you are part of the administration. Please try to work together and remember everybody there is part of one big team.
@SenKamalaHarris The military has always been a political force. Build the wall, obey the law. Kamala Harris, who are you working for other than yourself?
@Climatologist49 I thought Washington DC liked Humble Pie.
@AMike4761 What happened to the yelling about the separation between Church and State? It seems like the State is now putting the Muslin religion over all others, is that true?
@cindyhydesmith Racism - Nice word to throw around but it is being misused. Most Hispanics are Caucasian. Hispanic is a culture, not a race. Mexican is a nationality, not a race. Latino is an ethnicity not a race.
@cindyhydesmith I want my grandkids to be here for Christmas but unfortunately, they are trying to come here legally. Currently, there is a 9-year wait just to hear their case. Illegals get their hearing in the matter of months not years. Something needs to be done about this. No more illegals!
@NitaLowey @lohud Quit playing Candy Crush and get back to work for the people! Even the men!
@SenSchumer @senatemajldr Another vote to confirm!
@RepMikeQuigley When are you going to remember the OWG, I feel they are being thrown under the bus for political gains. Also what about all the obese people that get discriminated against even by the government? Are you going to help them?
@RWPUSA Wrong, it is a stethoscope and a Glock (easier to carry) and Chicago needs that now. NRA has nothing to do with this. What we need is for the criminals to register their weapons and stop selling them on the streets. When do you think Congress will act on that?
@TomiLahren I think the KKK loving Democrats need to boycott Georgia.
@CR I guess he wants to trade the LGBT members or does he only want to trade with the LGBT members. Please explain. Do not let any strange language get into the bill. If the LGBT gets in I want to see specific favorable wording for Old White Guys and the obese. Come on, fair is fair.
@CR Banned because of their religion. Time to check the Constitution.
@jahimes Talk to Jerry Brown and his associates on the burning conditions in Taxifornia. Saudi Arabia is a sovereign nation, tell us what to do. Tell China to quit stealing from us and play nice. Sometimes we have to act like the teacher and take the ball away. Oh Yeah, ban Acosta.
@DRUDGE_REPORT I keep looking but I have to find Acosta or CNN mentioned in the Constitution. How did the White House operate without them back in the 1870's?
@SarahPalinUSA New York, you wanted her for your representative. Good Luck, she yours now.
@RepJimCosta @natopapress @NATO Are you going to work with our allies and deter illegal aliens from coming here?
@RepJimCosta @natopapress @NATO Why Vice, you didn't make the cut for chairman?
@washingtonpost That is nice, I don't think any of them were classified. I send hundreds of emails concerning government business all the time. I send them to my senator and congressman and yes, even to the president. You never said what kind of government business.
@Elise_Jordan I thought you were covering Hillary.
@SenKamalaHarris Then why aren't you listening to that Republican president?
@SenWarren I have been trying to get a native English speaker as my primary doctor. Is there any chance of that?
@lachlan Has ANTIFA been classified yet? Is the Democratic party officially classified as a socialist organization yet?
@washingtonpost The "asylum" seekers were offered asylum in Mexico but they did not take it. They are no longer asylum seekers. If they try to come into the country, grab them and give them back to Mexico. Oh, they came from Honduras, tough Mexico allowed them through their country.
@stephemcneal The easy way to solve this: GET OFF INSTAGRAM!
@KirstenPowers Are you "white" or Hispanic because most hispanics are white. Apparently, you are a woman (no first-hand knowledge) &amp; you are trying to assert your female power over others. I believe you are racist &amp; a sexist. Change your name to Pat and remove your picture and see what happens.
@KirstenPowers I have examined mine and I don't get any "white privilege" in fact I have put my life on the line for this country. The main thing I see is women exerting their female privilege over those they want to control.
@RWPUSA Are you aware of the collusion between the KKK and the Democrats? If not go study history.
@PNS_CA All those protesting needs to go down and volunteer to sponsor an immigrant. If they need food or help then the immigrant goes to their sponsor and the sponsor needs to to be held responsible for all actions of their charge, including job, food, and medicine.
@PNS_CA Each immigrant coming here should have a sponsor or the means to keep themselves off of the public dole. If they can't then don't come here. We need to get our welfare roles down to those who really need it. Get rid of the generational welfare recipients.
@ChuckGrassley If wishes were horses, we would be up to our hips in horse crap.
@PNS_CA And?
@VeteransHealth Why does the Delta Insurance cost more for veterans than it does for Costco members?
@AP Almost looks like San Francisco, doesn't it?
@DiamondandSilk Who are the people that think ICE is acting like the KKK? It is the illegal aliens, so I don't care how they think. Who help developed the KKK, it was the Democrats. So why is Kamala Harris complaining about somebody acting like the group they helped come into being?
@SenSanders You talk about Wal-Mart, what about Amazon HQ2 where they are getting big tax breaks thanks to the politicians.
@kylegriffin1 With the mandates of Obamacare gone many companies can now hire people as full time instead of part-time. Doing so cuts the number of actual workers to what is needed instead of the inflationary number that the mandates Obamacare caused.
@kylegriffin1 Don't blame it all on the tax cuts. Out here in Taxifornia. If I owned a large company I do not want them telling me who I MUST have on the board. Many companies also use those tax cuts to make needed repairs and get the machines back in decent condition.
@funder Who are the candidates?	What is the message?	Who said we must pass it to see what is in it?	Who takes the most payoffs?	Who helps a failed Democratic official think shes still relevant?	Who looked at President Trump?	What is she most experienced at?	Who likes to hear themselves?
@kayleighmcenany She hasn't slept her way to the top yet, right Willie?
@DRUDGE_REPORT And this is a problem why?
@RepKClark I could pass Pelosi or Feinstein and not know who they are. They never get out in my neighborhood enough to talk to their constituents. As far as Cortez goes, enjoy looking young while you can.
@3scogbz @SenSanders I know but I lump all them in there because they want the private side to bear all the problems but don't want to hear they are not working properly. I know about the military. I was a brat then active. Been there done that.
@SenSanders What about the military families that qualify for food stamps? I don't see you talking about them. Could it be because you control their pay? You want the private side to increase pay but you are doing that on the public side. Don't forget about those on Social Security.
@RepSwalwell You are not listening.
@aninhaluci21 @washingtonpost They can still be denied entry, no matter what they do.
@aninhaluci21 @washingtonpost Asylum is legal if done correctly, but we don't have to give anybody asylum if we don't want to!
@washingtonpost If you want in, do it legally otherwise go home!
@SenSchumer I am demanding that you start working for your money and for the American people.
@SenSanders @RepRoKhanna Bernie, I hear a retirement home calling you. Please go there. No more socialism.
@TigerDol @SenGillibrand @staceyabrams What did Kemp do?
@WT_Slaughter @Geronim81284954 @SenGillibrand @staceyabrams They need to come in legally and we need to know everything about them, including name, skills, education, background, criminal activities, and medical history. Each person should also need a sponsor that would be responsible for them. No welfare for at least the first five years
@WT_Slaughter @Geronim81284954 @SenGillibrand @staceyabrams the term used in the laws is illegal aliens. The left uses undocumented all the time. The US Government uses illegal alien. My mother, ex-wife, and wife are all legal immigrants. Those coming across the border without permission are illegal aliens and need to be sent back.
@Belden35N @SenGillibrand @staceyabrams The person they registered just got her citizenship but they did not know that. In fact, her English was really bad and she spoke no Spanish. They registered her anyway without checking for citizenship. Each state needs to clamp down on their registrations.
@Belden35N @SenGillibrand @staceyabrams In Taxifornia I have personally seen it where a person registers to vote and when I question why they did not check for citizenship they said: "We take it on faith." That is not the way to do it, each person needs to be checked.
@Belden35N @SenGillibrand @staceyabrams They can walk in unregistered and vote a provisional ballot. It may not get counted until the person is verified. Not making anything up just putting it out there. You can check out the provisional ballot information. There are ways (illegal) to register to vote.
@walterhudon17 @jrolfe79 @SenGillibrand @staceyabrams The only thing I have been listening to is the speeches that both parties have made and the complaint the lawyers have made. I believe Kemp called for an exact match on the voter ID. There is nothing wrong with trying to ensure the citizenship of the one who votes.
@kcbrown83 @SenGillibrand @staceyabrams It is not just the Federalist:  https://t.co/vsNP9VR44J
@madeleine Sorry Madeline, but that was a different time. Today we have to watch who is coming here because we don't know what they really want to do here. During your time there was a feeling of joining the US culture, today it is: give me, give me, now leave me alone.
@AMike4761 It is time for large corporations to fight back. Move out of San Francisco. Look toward Central California or maybe even out of state. Do not look north they will tax you also.
@SenGillibrand I am an OWG who is overweight and I get discriminated against all the time. WHERE ARE YOU?
@jrolfe79 @diamondgirl2018 @SenGillibrand @staceyabrams That is your right, but be worried about voters outside GA because they may go there. I am worried about San Francisco allowing to non-citizens including illegal Aliens to vote. They say that it is only for the school board elections. Yeah, sure.
@marklevinshow I can understand CNN suing, but Acosta? CNN has had one of their toys taken away, but Acosta was just sent to time out. Frivolous lawsuit. Where does the law say that Acosta has to let into the White House for a press briefing?
@Debber66 @SheriffTNehls @realDonaldTrump It looks like the owner of the truck is thinking about sex too much.
@jrolfe79 @diamondgirl2018 @SenGillibrand @staceyabrams You tell us to stop but you should open your eyes to what is going on. Out here in Taxifornia the DMV is "accidentally" registering thousands of illegal aliens to vote. The DMV has changed to the party affiliation of registered voters from Republican to Democratic "accidentally."
@jrolfe79 @diamondgirl2018 @SenGillibrand @staceyabrams Nope never going to stop. She was talking about the Democratic Blue wave which was supposed to overrun the GOP and she did include non-citizens in that blue wave. Even now the Democratic Lawyers in Florida are trying to get non-citizens ballots counted. They should be fined.
@kcbrown83 @SenGillibrand @staceyabrams I have never said her opponent said it, I said she said it. Now we have the Democrats in Florida wanting the votes of non-citizens to be counted. That is against the law and they know it. They are trying to win at all costs and throw the rule book out the window. Obey the laws.
@kcbrown83 @SenGillibrand @staceyabrams In Palm Beach County, FL, Democrats argue to count votes cast by Non-Citizens: https://t.co/aAiEhwpXNM
@diamondgirl2018 @jrolfe79 @SenGillibrand @staceyabrams Even if you are "documented" but not a citizen you cannot vote. Voting is only for American Citizens, not just anyone here in the country. Stacey Abrams did say she wanted "undocumented" to vote also.
@diamondgirl2018 @jrolfe79 @SenGillibrand @staceyabrams Here is Stacey Abrams speech:  https://t.co/NHlVGUGzYf
@kcbrown83 @SenGillibrand @staceyabrams Here is Stacey Abrams speech: https://t.co/NHlVGUGzYf
@WT_Slaughter @SenGillibrand @staceyabrams Another verification with video of her speech: https://t.co/NHlVGUGzYf
@WT_Slaughter @SenGillibrand @staceyabrams For verification check out:  https://t.co/VH0vO0KZQG
@WT_Slaughter @SenGillibrand @staceyabrams Abrams said the following: ..."It is made up of those who have been told they are not worthy of being here. It is comprised of those who are documented and undocumented. It is comprised of those who have been told they’re successful and those who have been left behind."
@WT_Slaughter @SenGillibrand @staceyabrams Attorneys for Democrat candidate for Florida governor Andrew Gillum and  Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL) objected Saturday to the exclusion of a vote by a non-citizen. https://t.co/qx48h2aWj5  Check it out.
@timkaine Please stay in your own state. President Trump is correct. The environmentalist out here has caused such a mess with our forest that it is dangerous. The environmentalist does not allow for the removal of dead trees and such. That is where we have the problems. Too much fuel.
@Cat_MarqueeLV @darwinwoodka @maziehirono @realDonaldTrump Sorry, busy with granddaughters. Since he is acting I would have to look at it again. I am also wondering where it falls. Is it under the "shall" or the "may" statements. Thanks.
@SenGillibrand @staceyabrams Are all the votes legal votes? Abrams called for everybody to vote even the "undocumented." People who are not authorized to vote is illegal and those who entice them to vote should be held accountable. What else would she do if she gets into office?
@realDonaldTrump Counting all votes means counting all LEGAL votes. Any non-citizen voting needs to be found and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Put Americans back to work by driving buses full of illegal aliens back to the Mexican border.
@BradSherman The California Firefighters have already advised that much of the increase in fires is due to the environmentalist and their rules governing the forest.
@charliekirk11 Get all the illegal aliens out of our country. It does matter when they came or how long they have been here they need to leave now.
@SenSanders Is Social Security going to be tied to that raise in minimum wage? If so how much is it going to raise? An increase in the minimum wage is going to be more than double so are you going to more than double the Social Security? What about the military pay? Is that going to double?
@Cat_MarqueeLV @darwinwoodka @maziehirono @realDonaldTrump 3rd in line for what?
@ghhshirley @darwinwoodka @Cat_MarqueeLV @maziehirono @realDonaldTrump Checking, after lunch.
@VeteransHealth Why does the VA require veterans submit to involuntary drug tests? They say voluntary but if you don't do it they say they will take away your medication. If veterans have to do this shouldn't they get paid like they are on active duty since it is a requirement?
@darwinwoodka @Cat_MarqueeLV @maziehirono @realDonaldTrump Is he required to be confirmed by the Senate in the Constitution? Not talking about a statutory Act but constitutional requirement.
@mdvagov If a veteran is on Tramadol do you require them to have random drug tests?
@USCIS What is the average waiting time for people wishing to immigrate from South Korea to the US?
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Just because many people say that doesn't make it true. Years ago many people said the earth was flat. It did not make it so. What are YOU  saying about it? Is it unconstitutional and if so cite your references. Statutory Acts do not mean it is in the Constitution.
@MerrillHeidi @AllenWest Not in Florida that I know of but didn't the candidate in the Georgia Governer's race tell the people to commit voter fraud by voting even if they are undocumented?
@Cat_MarqueeLV @maziehirono @realDonaldTrump How was it unconstitutional? What part made it unconstitutional?
@maziehirono @realDonaldTrump Should Justice Kavanagh receive the same Senate confirmation since he had been confirmed before?
@CoryBooker Cory, you need to specify - every legal vote must be counted. If the voter voted illegally then they need to be arrested. Just because some politician wants you to vote does not mean you are eligible to vote. If you are not a citizen you cannot vote.
@PNS_CA Where are these teachers located? What do they teach? If they are going disinvest in private prison, what is the reason for doing that? Nice to be applauding but who made that decision?
@LincolnFresno @RepAdamSchiff I want to see him pass legislation to end political corruption. If that works then we can start in on the evil people do.
@vicenews As much as I don't like her being poor is not a crime. She can do like millions of other Americans, live out of her car if she has one. She may soon realize where she went wrong.
@bodysurfinyon @RepKClark Not a reaction, a question. I mourn for the victims but I am not going to go and say we must ban this or that until we know what happened. We have that happen way too much recently. People start demanding things but don't know all the facts.
@washingtonpost In that case, they should stay away and go back to where their microbes can flourish. They should consider the health of their microbes and stay out of this country.
@marklevinshow I saw a little kid who did not want others to play so he threw a tantrum. He was called on because he had his hand raised but when his turn was over he did not want others to get to ask their questions, so he threw a tantrum. Definitely time for a timeout.
@RepKClark How do we know he got the gun legally, he may have bought them on the streets of Los Angeles, where everything is for sale. Please wait for the facts before condemning anything.
@GeraldoRivera @Acosta @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I saw a little kid who did not want others to play so he threw a tantrum. He was called on because he had his hand raised but when his turn was over he did not want others to get to ask their questions, so he threw a tantrum. Definitely time for a timeout.
@washingtonpost Different times, different situations.
@CNNPR @realDonaldTrump A great example of Fake News. Jim was acting like a little bratty kid who does not want to play well with others. CNN was acting like a helicopter parent who thinks their child is right all the time. Both CNN and Jim need a timeout and a lesson in civility. Play Nice!
@HillaryClinton By the way, your votes don't count if you voted for Hillary this time.
@ericbolling I wish her well.
@JohnEkdahl I saw a little kid who did not want others to play so he threw a tantrum. He was called on because he had his hand raised but when his turn was over he did not want others to get to ask their questions, so he threw a tantrum. Definitely time for a timeout.
@washingtonpost The White House is acting like the playground monitor. Sending a misbehaving child to timeout because he doesn't want to play nice with others. He is a spoiled brat and needed a timeout. CNN is a helicopter parent who thinks their child is always right.
@JebBush Not a media thing: I saw a little kid who did not want others to play so he threw a  tantrum. He was called on because he had his hand raised but when his turn was over he did not want others to get to ask their questions, so he threw a tantrum. Definitely time for a timeout.
@derekahunter I saw a little kid who did not want others to play so he threw a  tantrum. He was called on because he had his hand raised but when his turn was over he did not want others to get to ask their questions, so he threw a tantrum. Definitely time for a timeout.
@KatiePavlich I saw a little kid who did not want others to play so he threw a  tantrum. He was called on because he had his hand raised but when his turn was over he did not want others to get to ask their questions, so he threw a tantrum. Definitely time for a timeout.
@Acosta I saw a little kid who did not want others to play so he threw a tantrum. He was called on because he had his hand raised but when his turn was over he did not want others to get to ask their questions, so he threw a tantrum. Definitely time for a timeout.
@JerryBrownGov Why don't you wish a happy birthday on Buddhas birthday?
@chuckwoolery Are those fangs she is baring?
@RealCandaceO What about overweight lives? Do they matter?
@DRUDGE_REPORT Please put it back on.
@Katerin08101298 Welcome
@DRUDGE_REPORT I believe they are Russian.
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump As a vet, I really would not want to go to another country just to protect it from migrants when they don't want to do the work themselves.
@HillaryClinton @votolatino @lyft One reason not to use Lyft. They are following the Democratic motto of giving out more entitlements to keep the populace under control. Are the Lyft drivers getting full pay for providing free rides? Are these free to polling places only or can they be used to go shopping?
@RepJayapal The only fearmongering that I can see is coming from the Democrats because they are afraid that they will lose again. Suck it up and put on your big boy pants or in Feinstein and Pelosi's case put on your old lady panties.
@RepJayapal Where is the racist fearmongering? All I see is President Trump trying to stop illegal aliens from invading our country. In case you don't know (and you can research it) most hispanics are caucasian by their DNA. This is not about racism it is about security &amp; safety of the USA!
@seanmdav No, just scary.
@RealCandaceO @BLEXIT That is all nice but why don't overweight people have that? Instead, we are told go to the gym all the time.
@BreitbartNews No flag, no money, so sorry.
@noteabaggers @SarahPalinUSA Who said anything about Fox News, but it obvious you bow to the feet of a Feinstein idol.
@redmooney @DonaldJTrumpJr There is always one that dominates. It is not always what one looks like but it is there in the DNA. The main point is that Hispanic is not a race, it is a culture.
@RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump @BLEXIT Maybe she weighed too much. What do you think Candace?
@SarahPalinUSA Unions also need to be held accountable for giving them membership which indicates that they are able to work here. The union leaders also need to fines &amp; subject to jail time unless they indicate on all their cards &amp; information who is here illegally and not authorized to work.
@SarahPalinUSA Jobs, All these people want money and if they don't steal it then they work for it. They will be taking away jobs from quite a few people. One of those industries is the construction industry. The employers need to be threatened with heavy fines and jail for hiring them.
@SarahPalinUSA This is not a scare tactic just facts of what uncontrolled immigration can cause. Illegal aliens pose a threat to our country whether the Democrats like it or not. You would not let random people live in your house without your permission. It should be the same for our country!
@SarahPalinUSA All their children will be going to our schools causing increased class sizes and more money spent on our schools to teach them. That money could have been better spent on those here legally. The children that came with may have communicable diseases that are not common here.
@SarahPalinUSA It is said that they don't get welfare, technically that may be true, but their children born here do. The parents get money from the government along with housing money for each child they have. They do not have the limit that American have in how much they get.
@SarahPalinUSA Should you be worried about the caravans? Yes, and you should also be worried about those who sneak across the border. There is a lot of reasons to be worried. How many of them are pregnant and going to have anchor babies? Each one of them will probably end up on the welfare.
@DRUDGE_REPORT I guess they can claim the mental disability but they still did not have a placard. I wonder if a call to the police would have helped. They should have least received a ticket for blocking a handicap spot. Common sense and civility do not seem to exist with them.
@DonaldJTrumpJr I wonder if Don Lemon knows that most Hispanics are Caucasium by their DNA? He yells about "Brown" people, I wonder if he also including those who like to get a suntan at the beaches? That makes me jealous at times. As far as the DNA goes research it. How many races are there?
@RealJamesWoods Start demanding that the elementary schools identify those who are here illegally so that they can be screened for communicable diseases. Why should your child be put at risk because someone doesn't want to obey our laws? This is our country, not theirs. Build the wall obey laws.
@RealJamesWoods Take a good look at the elementary schools in Los Angeles. They won't exactly tell you what kind of diseases that are being brought into our country by illegal aliens. If they come in the correct way and are screened for the disease then your children will be at less risk.
@RealCandaceO Another group that is discriminated against. You yell about the discrimination of the Latinos, blacks and other groups. It now seems like it ok to discriminate and put down people who do not have a body style you like. This happens to both men and women. You are being hateful.
@SenFeinstein Build the wall, obey the laws or don't come here!
@GovMikeHuckabee Here is one for you to think about: Why does heaven have a gate? Do you think that God wants to restrict access to heaven? A key is even provided to the gate if you qualify.
@IngrahamAngle I thought Halloween was over but she just proved it is not, scary!
@dgjeeoppw @sethmoulton I have more ridiculous things out here in Taxifornia.
@BreitbartNews That is almost as funny as the 9-year old elementary student in Fresno CA getting PTSD from having to push-ups. At least that what her mother and some Psychiatrist said. I personally think it is the mother who has the problem. She is suing the school district due to the push-ups.
@sethmoulton Do you think we need to restrict access to this country? Before you answer that, answer this: Why does heaven have a gate? Do you think that God wants to restrict access to heaven? A key is even provided to the gate if you qualify.
@wrexcat That has always boggled the mind if they are so poor, how do they pay the coyotes? Maybe the coyotes are cheaper than they let on and maybe politicians always keep the promises. Miracles can happen. On a side note, why does heaven have a gate? Is it to restrict entry?
@RepRoKhanna What about the American citizens that are losing their jobs to the illegal aliens coming into our country? Are you going to work for American citizens?
@dbongino A judge needs to rule that this is a frivolous lawsuit and charge them the full amount for the time taken up to make the ruling including the amount of the government lawyers. Make them pay for the wall and obey the laws. It is our country, not theirs.
@JmoSmooth13 @glaad @AthleteAlly Are you going to stop the bullying against people who are overweight?
@DailyMailUK Daily Mail, those four are middle eastern not Asian. You owe an apology to those who are Asian for your misrepresentation of a group of people. How about the just spelling it out. They are part of a grooming (Rapist) gang who are Muslim. Get the truth out there.
@SenSanders Bernie Sanders agenda is clear:		1) Lie	2) Lie	3) Lie	4) Lie
@marklevinshow Don Lemon needs to be let go. If Megan Kelly can be let go for saying something was done in the past, then this racist needs to be fired 5 days before he said it.
@CNN Love it. Everybody who had an ancestor who didn't have the right to vote. You would think she was talking about blacks. Well, don't forget women didn't have the right to vote until after blacks got the vote, so everybody who had a woman in their ancestry meets her qualifications.
@SenSchumer @AmericanCancer listening to Chuck Schumer is harmful to people who may have mental issues. He may push them over the edge.
@EricTrump @CNN Is there any way to get them out of the airports?
@BetteMidler Halloween is over, you can now take off that mask that is covering your soul.
@SenMarkey @stophandguns @ChangeTheRef @RepJoeKennedy @MassAGO @SpeakerDeLeo @RepDavidLinsky How are you going to really stop criminals from getting guns? They don't exactly obey the laws. They have friends that all over the world that will be able to provide them with what they want. Shouldn't law abiding people at least have a fair chance to defend themselves.
@SenSanders People have to have more to afford anything. Gas goes up, food goes up, housing goes up. the only thing that does not go up is the fixed incomes.
@SenSanders Paying people what they are worth gives your money more buying power. People who are on fixed incomes are able to do more with their money and not fighting to make ends meet. Raising the minimum wage causes the prices to go up all along the board.
@SenSanders As one of masses, I know that a lower minimum wage would make people work harder for what they want. Pay people what they are worth and not what they think they are entitled to. Raising the minimum wage just causes the prices of everything to go up.
@SenSanders According to the stats, Bernie Sanders wealth has increased by at least 2 million percent since 1941.
@SenSanders You complain that the company profits have gone up. How much has been reinvested in the company? Who takes the risk in the company? Who provides the jobs? Who pays outrageous taxes? The government did not build it! I don't hear you complaining about your pay and doing less work.
@SenSanders Hey, Bernie, when you were a little kid (Not much has changed in that area) what was the minimum wage then? You do realize that a minimum wage was a starting wage and you worked up from there. Imagine the starting at the minimum and never needing going up. Why work harder?
@squattchie What are you doing, trying to give racist a bad name? Please apologize to them.
@benshapiro Where is my candy corn?
@SenSanders Move out of Taxifornia!
@ntsAllOverMe @bnowalk @RepSanfordSC Well, Halloween is over and I did not deprive anyone who came up to my place any candy. There were just a few people giving candy in my area and only a few decked out children. It is too bad because Halloween used to be such a nice time. People spiking the candy ruined it.
@CapitolHe11 @bnowalk @RepSanfordSC That is not really true, there have been a few I have not voted for in the past but there are more Democrats I never voted for and they got in. I try to look at the character of the people running and go from there. Like Bill "I never inhaled" Clinton.
@Chinchillazllla @ntsAllOverMe @bnowalk @RepSanfordSC BSA - Boy Scouts of America? B - Bartender? SVR - server? New merit badge?
@Chinchillazllla @ntsAllOverMe @bnowalk @RepSanfordSC Did you get apples? They tried giving us toothbrushes (with a small tube of toothpaste). As far as the Constitution goes, you now can also blame it on the Democrats because they are now screaming about the birthright decision being unconstitutional. Both sides are bringing it up.
@ComfortablySmug Who is paying for their food? Is it the Mexican Government or the US Government? Maybe they buy it themselves with the saving from not paying coyotes? Someone is paying where they shouldn't have to. Let them go back home &amp; if they want to immigrate do it legally.
@TruthPipe @washingtonpost As far as Tit-for-Tat about which countries offer birthright citizenship it should also be noted who did and why they don't do it now. The reasons are valid and need to be out there. Besides it was in your article you referenced so you put it out there for consideration.
@TruthPipe @washingtonpost Because it is so much fun getting some of the replies. I like immigrants, my mother, ex-wife and current wife are immigrants. I just don't like illegal aliens because they think they are better than others who do it legally.
@cnni Put your big boy pants on and learn to cope with problems. Growing up I had the stress of war and seeing the numbers of American killed on TV. We had race riots, bombings, corrupt politicians, considered an adult at 18, off of our parent's insurance at 18 and no school shrinks.
@RealJamesWoods Has she started packing yet? She could move to Russia or China, that way it would be more than just a quick drive across the border. Will anybody really miss her?
@bnowalk @RepSanfordSC Don't hate kids just don't want illegal aliens in the country. Blame the parents. They don't want to obey our laws and try to sneak into the country. The parents are teaching the kids that our laws mean nothing and they are entitled to whatever they want. Build The Wall.
@HillaryClinton If you want to help them go down there and escort them back to their own country. I do not want any more illegal aliens in our country. In fact, deport all the illegal Aliens and start concentrating on those who apply legally. Send the anchor babies back with their mothers.
@washingtonpost How can you tell that is a Jewish man? Is there any identifying tattoo or birthmark? I just don't see it. It could be a Brazilian or a Frenchman.
@TruthPipe @washingtonpost You will see that it is listed in the document you shared.
@TruthPipe @washingtonpost I know. It was just a point that India and Malta did have the birthright citizenship until the illegal aliens started overrunning their countries.
@BernieSanders It is not racism to not want illegal aliens in the country. It is stupidity to want them here. We don't know who they are or what their background is. what is their education level? Why do they want to come here? We need to know! It is not anti-immigrant just sound policy.
@BernieSanders Why should we stand with illegal aliens when we can't get the legal immigrants here is a timely manner. To hell with the illegals, keep them out of our country and let the legal immigrants in when they show themselves to be beneficial. We don't need more rock throwing thugs.
@Fakefsb @maziehirono @realDonaldTrump It does feel like it is getting a little cooler, but of course when I went through High School they said we are the start of another ice age.
@SenatorLeahy Presidential Fiat, oh the shades of Obama. Where is your proof that "trade Wars" erased the gains? Please be specific for those who like to make sound judgements. Subjects don't change, but there are a lot of them. Just because you don't like one does not mean it goes away.
@SenBlumenthal Was that like you trying to say you fought in Vietnam?
@TruthPipe @washingtonpost Countries Removing Birthright Citizenship, India and Malta have both abolished jus soli. India abolished jus soli on December 3, 2004, because of the flock of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh who were taking advantage of the rule to gain citizenship.
@Acosta Nice words, now live them.
@maziehirono @realDonaldTrump Nice try. The constitution was changed when they added the 14th Amendment. Now we can change it again and define the 14th Amendment further. Get congress back to work for the American people and not the illegal aliens.
@SenatorMenendez Are you saying that if you commit an illegal act to have your kid born in the US is ok? Then why are there any laws at all? I say Congress (Dems) needs to get their act together and correct this situation. Only those here legally should get the benefit of citizenship by birth.
@NydiaVelazquez @realDonaldTrump You call it a distraction, I call it a necessity. Coming here illegally does not make your kids legal. Children should not benefit due to the illegal actions of the parents. Raise your kids to obey the laws not break them.
@RepHastingsFL @realDonaldTrump Why didn't you tell Obama that? There is still debate on what the 14th amendment was about. Due to the timing of the 14th Amendment, I would go with making the slaves full citizens.
@unperturbable @RealJamesWoods I thought it was a San Francisco park.
@NancyPelosi @StephenAtHome I have to say it: Stop peddling you A$$ around and get back to work for the American citizens.
@KatTimpf Happy Birthday!
@KatTimpf I am way ahead of you. I can't say it gets better, but it does keep on going and going.
@MEPFuller Continue...go after all the injustice. Try going to a restaurant in Washington DC without a hassle.
@BernieSanders @Scholten4Iowa Do not raise the minimum wage, increase buying power. No more hiring illegal aliens. Get rid of that Hey, Hey, Got to go slogan. That one is really old. I heard that when I was a preteen a long time ago.
@BernieSanders @Scholten4Iowa Bernie supports the fall of the US and invasion by people who will not obey our laws. we don't need Bernie or the people that he is supporting. Illegal Aliens take jobs from American citizens and those people that come here legally.
@RepAdamSmith We cannot be a global leader if we cannot secure our own borders. Gwet people like Rep. Smith out and get someone in that has the concerns of the American people in mind!
@RepAdamSmith I am tired of the global leader nonsense &amp; want our leaders to provide safety and security from those who want to invade and take over our land. These people already said they don't care about our laws or borders. They want to take and not obey. Build the wall, secure the border!
@RepAdamSmith The role of the US Government on our borders is to protect the American people and their sovereignty. If it takes the military to do then so be it. Those politicians that don't want the borders secure need to let their constituents know so they can get better representatives.
@glennbeck Do they have a version of Hillary Clinton there? Maybe Maxine waters wrote the regulations. Eric Holder may be the judge for all the cases. I  agree with the sentiments but not the results. Personal Credit? Worse than our credit scores.
@washingtonpost This one may be a copycat. We need to wait and see. Hopefully it is a dud also. If it is a copycat then we need to get the culprit ASAP.
@cnni What they don't say in this feed is that his passport had been canceled. He has dual citizenship with the US and Saudi. His US citizenship is now under question. If you misrepresent yourself on the US citizenship, it can be revoked at any time. Tell the truth, obey the laws.
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump I believe they have the right to apply but not the right to be accepted. All those who apply need to have their cases heard but they do not need to come here to have that happen. We need to have them stay in the country where they apply from. They can't jump to the front.
@micheal_eller @HillaryClinton @runforsomething It is hard to trust anybody but sometimes you have to overlook the rhetoric and look at the results. While President Trump is loud and boisterous he does get results. It is the results that I like so as long as he gets results, keep the noise coming.
@AMike4761 We need to know who they are, what is the medical history, what is their education, what is their criminal history. They need to get to the back of the line and let those who applied in first. not just from Mexico but from all other countries. Build the wall, obey the laws.
@FoxNewsInsider @TomiLahren @seanhannity Those who live in Taxifornia needs to get out and see the rest of the nation. See how they think about the border walls. The Pope says that it is wrong but yet he has walls around the Vatican. Even heaven has gates and must pass a test to get in. Shouldn't we have at least that?
@RealJamesWoods What color were her eyes?
@shaunking AR-15 is not an assault rifle. The AR does not stand for Assault Rifle, it is the initials of the company that manufactured it ArmaLite. It is a semi-automatic rifle that kind of looks like a Colt AR-15 but it is the same as a deer rifle, just look different.
@JacksonLeeTX18 @HillaryClinton A true champion of women? Why do you lie like that?
@Tori_Sachs @JohnJamesMI Hold off on the President bit, let's see how he does as Senator first. Good Luck Gunner.
@JohnJamesMI You are partially correct. the Democrats care more about the votes than they do about the people. They don't care who votes as long as they vote for them. They want everyone including the illegal aliens to vote as long as they vote for democrats. Examples are Taxifornia Democrats
@SecNielsen Are they still doing monitoring of the cameras over the internet?
@NME Does this mean they are not going to rerun the episodes that Apu in them? Oh, my. One of the best characters on the show. What about those insensitive rednecks they always have with the really obese people they show? Are they going to put all the obese people on diets?
@AGBecerra @NHTSAgov @EPA Can you get a petition on getting the wall built faster to protect the American citizens? That would something great that you can do. Build the walls, obey the laws.
@SenThomTillis @DeptVetAffairs @SecWilkie @InsideSourcesDC There is one thing the VA is doing that is not being done to civilians and that is unannounced random drug tests. If the veteran doesn't want to do a drug test they are threatened with having drugs taken away from them. We are not treated like civilians. We are threatened.

@earlineleone1 @JCrongeyer @GeorgeTakei That wouldn't be so bad but in Taxifornia the DMV has been "accidentally" changing political parties from Republican to Democratic and also immigrants both legal and illegal have been "accidentally" registered to vote. The DMV is currently being audited, by itself!
@GeorgeTakei George, don't forget to tell them only American Citizen can register and vote. Registering if you are not a citizen is also a crime.
@RepMaxineWaters Social Security - Stop giving it to refugees who have never put a dime into it. It is supposed to be for those who have paid into it not freeloaders.
@RepMaxineWaters As a senior, I noticed that it is the Democrats who are taking my money especially here in Taxifornia. Taxifornia needs to get the GOP back in so our standard of living can go back up. We need our safety and security also. With the Democrats and sanctuary cities, that's not here.
@kevliz97 @RepJoeKennedy Don't forget North Korea, (DPRK) Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea. You can assign names to anything but it is actions that define. Patriotism does not mean you have accepted everyone. It means pride in your country. We need to protect our country from invaders.
@RepJoeKennedy They are not migrants, they are invaders. Block them from getting in and start working on the people who have started the legal process for immigration. Stop all applications from south of the border and make them get in line like the legal applicants.
@SarahPalinUSA I have been there, it is your backyard, you take care of it. Don't blame someone else for your failings. You wanted corruption, you have it. Instead spending your money liberally be conservative and spend it the best way. More cops, call ICE, Enforce laws. Make kids go to school.
@FoxNews @Richardafowler @foxnewsnight He can sponsor some of them if he wants but make sure he puts up a good bond up front. None of them trying to come across meet the refugee status. Refugees need to go to the nearest country that would be safe for them. What about Belize or Mexico. They could have gone south.
@w_terrence Can I join you on that call?
@RealCandaceO Sorry, I was out of the country.
@lawprofblawg @socalmagagirl37 @charliekirk11 @______I______l_ That doesn't cover all the languages in the area. It they are going to do that then it needs to be in every language spoken in the area. If it costs them then so be it. It is their fault.
@charliekirk11 Are there going to be federal election officials checking the ballots to make sure that American Rights are upheld?
@w_terrence @AppleSupport I have been working IT since eons ago and I have never trusted "the cloud."
@WayneDupreeShow This our country and our laws and if you want to come here then you must come by our rules and laws and not your. If you don't want to abide by our laws then do not apply. Stay Home!
@WayneDupreeShow We need to cut back on the number of South and Central American immigrants and get caught up in other regions of the world, including European and Asian immigrants. These people that are trying to cross our borders need to be reminded this is our country and not theirs.
@WayneDupreeShow We need people who want to work to come here legally. No more undocumented (Illegal Aliens). If you need workers then sponsor them. As soon as they are not needed they can go back. If they want to immigrate here then get in line. Learn English while waiting.
@WayneDupreeShow Illegal aliens are a threat to our country. We don't know who they really are. what diseases do they have? what are their criminal backgrounds? what is their education level? I heard a democratic spokeshole say they need undocumented aliens to work the fields. No, we don't.
@WayneDupreeShow Those [people that are marching to our southern border are carrying flags of foreign countries. The only time you see an army of people carrying their own flag to another country's border is when they are invading that country. They need to be turned away immediately.
@WayneDupreeShow Build the Wall. Obey the laws. Immediate enforcement of zero tolerance! Safety and security first. Who are they? No criminals need to apply. No more anchor babies, no welfare, no WIC for the first five years they are here. They must be self-supporting. They need to have a sponsor
@WayneDupreeShow I am trying to get my stepson here from another country that does not speak Spanish. There is currently a waiting list of about 10 years for that country. I want to know why illegal aliens think they have the right to come here before those who are trying to come here legally?
@eggymce Taxifornia does what it wants. I hope you are right, but....
@eggymce Don't worry Taxifornia will find some way to ban it.
@CNN Cannot be used in Taxifornia where everything causes cancer. Careful of the air you breathe, the water you drink, the food you eat, and the hands of your partner.
@foxandfriends While they are investigating the "bomb" how about investigating him like they are doing with President Trump. Check to see if he is hiring foreign people to influence the elections.
@VP @NDU_EDU @POTUS Can you please have your people get the names they are requesting money correct. They keep misspelling and getting my name in wrong order.
@SenBlumenthal What about the rights of Veterans, shouldn't they have the right of not having people steal their valor?
@SenBlumenthal What about the rights of American citizens who do not speak, read or write English or Spanish? Shouldn't they be able to get voting ballots in their language?
@SenBlumenthal What about the civil rights of the obese?
@kenavotetrump Bring back the holey board of education!
@BBCWorld Is there a group of people headed for the southern US border? What are their intentions? Do they plan to comply with US laws for entering the country? Please answer these questions to make sure there is no false information going around.
@BreitbartNews Why should anybody be forced into hiring somebody that is not good for them no matter what happens. That is not the freedom of America. The kneeler should know that his actions have consequences and if he doesn't like that, tough.
@w_terrence Here is my DNA breakdown: 	  Asian – 5%	  European – 6%	  African – 4%	  Robot – 6%	  Robot Overload -8%	  Young Punk -11%	  Female - .005%	  OWG – 59.995%
@CNN What are "thought leaders?" Are they supposed to tell us how to think?
@BBCWorld You got here, now go home. If you cannot obey our laws we do not want you. we have enough people applying to come here legally already. Bye Bye.
@JohnCornyn How about: In Orange County, 13 of the 24 people running for office have the same last name.
@washingtonpost Oooppss.
@foxandfriends The people in the caravan are waving the Honduran Flag. That is a sign of an invading army. If they hate Honduras so much they are leaving then why wave the flag? We need to stop them at the border. If they try to come in legally then take their Phone number then turn them around
@BreitbartNews Build the Wall. Obey the laws. Immediate enforcement of zero tolerance! Safety and security first. Who are they? No criminals need to apply. No more anchor babies, no welfare, no WIC for the first five years they are here. They must be self-supporting. They need to have a sponsor
@AnnCoulter If I was still hiring and a person came to me today with a degree from one of the Ivy League schools that would immediately disqualify them from any position within my company. I want people who work, not whiners.
@DonaldJTrumpJr This is one way to help pay down the debt. Charge each country X5 for the cost of each illegal alien. If it cost us 3000 then we need to charge the offending country 15000. We can take it away from the money we give them. Take the overage and start putting it against the wall.
@ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump Build the Wall. Obey the laws. Immediate enforcement of zero tolerance! Safety and security first. Who are they? No criminals need to apply. No more anchor babies, no welfare, no WIC for the first five years they are here. They must be self-supporting. They need to have a sponsor
@ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump . תבנה את הקיר . לציית לחוקים אכיפה מיידית של אפס סובלנות! . בטיחות ואבטחה קודם ? מי הם . אין צורך להקשיב לפושעים לא עוד תינוקות עוגן, לא רווחה, לא WIC במשך חמש השנים הראשונות הם כאן. . הם בטח תומכים בעצמם הם צריכים ספונסר

@kilmeade People need to learn to embrace history so they can learn from it. People who don't want to acknowledge history will not learn from it. Pulling down statues and removing books because it offends them is not the way to learn. Read, study learn, then do.
@AMike4761 She needs to stay where she is at. She made the conditions now she needs to live in them. Actions have consequences. SJW need to learn that.
@GSDAlpha Got you beat by one president. To me, it is a toss-up between Reagan and Trump. The worst I believe was Obama followed by Carter. Clinton was the laughing stock of the world. I was overseas when the Monica thing hit. What an embarrassment.
@SpongeHarris @FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC @MariaBartiromo Where is the map of the Aztec nation?
@FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC @MariaBartiromo Definitely, invaders notice they are waving their flags while marching to our borders! Stop them at the borders, do not even let them apply, turn them around, build the wall, obey the laws. Our country, not theirs!
@AMike4761 There have been a lot of protests by the Catholic Church against many American things including the US Military. They protested the bases in South Korea, They tell us who we need to let into our country while they keep their wall up. They want us to help while they demand tithes.
@w_terrence Let's see racial makeup:	Japanese - .5%	Canadian - 3%	French   - 0.05%	Mongolian - 0.15 %	Robot - 4.3 %	Cyborg - 2%	Robot Overlord - .5%	OWG - 89.65%
@RosenforNevada They want your money, but I say give the GOP your vote, it is well worth any amount of money they will spend. Get the money grabbers out of the government.
@FoxNews What does the Bible say?
@CNN I called shotgun first.
@FAIRImmigration What I want to see first is the the wall, then enforce the laws already on the books. No reform till the wall is built and current laws are enforced.
@SenGillibrand I want a candidate who is best qualified for the job, woman, child, man, dog cat, Godzilla, I don't care. Just give me the best!
@SenWarren What I earn is mine so keep your filthy fingers out of it!
@RealJamesWoods Kujenga ukuta. Kutii sheria. Utekelezaji wa haraka wa uvumilivu sifuri! Ulinzi na usalama kwanza. Wao ni nani? Wahalifu hakuna haja ya kutumia. Tena Fungia watoto, ustawi hakuna, hakuna WIC kwa miaka mitano ya kwanza ni hapa. Lazima itegemee. Wanahitaji kuwa na mdhamini
@RealJamesWoods Build the Wall. Obey the laws. Immediate enforcement of zero tolerance! Safety and security first. Who are they? No criminals need to apply. No more anchor babies, no welfare, no WIC for the first five years they are here. They must be self-supporting. They need to have a sponsor
@SenGillibrand decriminalization of Marijuana will cause a large increase in the sales of girl scout cookies, maybe even a shortage. Other than that do not drive stoned.
@BernieSanders People please go read the thread or the speeches that were given and you see where the liars are.
@BernieSanders Talk about liars, both of you. Look at what was actually said and any person with 1 sliver of sense will see what he actually said. Bernie Sanders, you are an absolute liar and con artist. Daniel Dale, tell the truth. I know it will hard for both of you but please practice.
@cnni That is OK, I was just waiting for it to get up there before I won.
@RonWyden Do we have to go through Portland to get there. I am afraid I may have to disobey the Antifa traffic cops there.
@cathymcmorris Just think how many jobs there could have been if the illegal aliens weren't taking them. Build the wall, obey the laws. Not their country!
@BreakingNLive I wonder if they were using legally obtained guns?
@CR @JenKuznicki Too bad we can't have antifa march south to Honduras.
@FoxNewsInsider @greggutfeld @GregGutfeldShow Does he has any elfin or robotic overload mix in his DNA?
@GovPressOffice @JerryBrownGov @chucktodd @MSNBC What does Gov Moonbeam have to say for himself other than he wants more money and power for himself and not the legal citizens of Taxifornia? He needs to sit down and shut up.
@cnni Great and please don't try to make up for the loss of the tax money from another source. Cut back the spending on things we don't need like sending more money to South America.
@FoxNews @BretBaier Was the journalist Jamal Khashoggi an American citizen?

@SenGillibrand It is my right as an American citizen but it is not the right of an immigrant or illegal alien. Once an immigrant becomes a citizen then it is their right but illegal alien do not even have the right to sign up to vote! Build the wall and obey the laws! Not their country!
@DineshDSouza @TheDemocrats I want to get my step sons and my granddaughters here. I am trying to do it legally but they are on a waiting list of almost ten years. Why would any person trying to sneak into our country get in before people who are doing it legally? Send them back to Mexico. Walls and Laws!
@chinabeach59 I just saw that. Yep, he needs to be scorned for his actions. (or accusations)
@DHSgov @SecNielsen Build the Wall. Obey the laws. Immediate enforcement of zero tolerance! Safety and security first. Who are they? No criminals need to apply. No more anchor babies, no welfare, no WIC for the first five years they are here. They must be self-supporting. They need to have a sponsor
@SenatorTimScott Are you working to keep the American citizens in South Carolina employed? What are you doing about the illegal aliens who are taking jobs in South Carolina? Do they get any benefits including education from the taxpayers of South Carolina? Highlight that if they do.
@washingtonpost Was the journalist an American Citizen?
@chinabeach59 The question is guilty of what? He did admit he sexually assaulted a young woman. Did she come forward and accuse him? Not that I have heard. Of course, he is guilty of something, we all are. As an OWG I appear to be guilty of everything, but I didn't do it. Whatever it is.
@radiokaos666 @Scavino45 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @LukeAFB Having spent over 14 years on B52, UH1, UH60 AH64 and CH47 aircraft I believe I know a little about them. Also, the fleet is no longer grounded, In fact, NAS Lemoore is back to full operation.
@chinabeach59 She tries to every chance she gets. I know she still yearns for Willie even despite his age. Elderly abuse maybe.
@radiokaos666 @Scavino45 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @LukeAFB Never said I worked on them but I have seen them being brought into the hangar after a test flight. The people who did the checks would plug in their laptops and download all the data. How do you know what I know about the F-35? what do you know about them?
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Jeff, repeat after me. Vote GOP, Vote GOP, Vote GOP. What about the violence put out by Maxine Waters, Cory Booker and Eric Holder. It is ok to harass Trump supported but not reporters? Tell your own people to be civil. I am tired of being told that we are violent.
@cnni I was at the store yesterday and almost made the purchase. I am an OWG well over 40. It is working.
@greggutfeld I remember my first portal, it was round, about 13 inches across and only showed black and white. It did have a voice-controlled channel and volume remote control. Me. Anytime my dad wanted the channel changed he would tell me to do it.
@Scavino45 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @LukeAFB You really ought to see it when they bring one back in that just went on a shakeout flight. All those laptops being hooked up to it. Nothing like the old days when you had mechanics swarming everywhere. Beautiful Sight.
@CR He really needs start using his real name or put his nickname in quotes. It is hard to trust someone who does not identify who he is.
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump Build the Wall. Obey the laws. Immediate enforcement of zero tolerance! Safety and security first. Who are they? No criminals need to apply.

@BernieSanders If you ask Maxine waters, Cory Booker or Eric Holder politics is an MMA Sport. Even Hillary Clinton says it is uncivil. She should know, look at the way she treated the women her husband assaulted. Vote GOP. Make the Country Great Again.
@Fresno_State @LamasVPSA @UnivisionFresno @calstate @FresnoStateASI @BulldogsTell @FresnoStateAlum @LisaMBoyles @FresnoBee @JosephICastro @USNewsEducation Do you have any other language help, such as Korean, Tagalog, English or maybe Japanese? If you are going to help one group shouldn't other group be given a helping hand also? Why do people who come from another country have to pay out of state tuition?
@KennedyNation That is like those who call their mothers hoes. I don't know why they like to call their mothers a farm implement but a 2nd-grade education does not go too far.
@SteveKingIA @worldnetdaily Why should it hurt President Trump? According to Obama everything that is going on right now is what he started, the economy and such so why not the illegal alien invasions?
@CRTV @deneenborelli It wouldn't surprise me if her ancestors came over on the Mayflower. That would be a shot in the arm she needs.
@CRTV @deneenborelli I am an OWG but I feel Asian today. Maybe I feel like an Asian female today so you have to believe me. One second thought Maybe I am an Asian Female Lesbian, so you have to believe me and give better treatment than everyone else. Never mind I will deal what God gave me.
@SaraCarterDC Build the Wall. Obey the laws. Immediate enforcement of zero tolerance! Safety and security first. Who are they? No criminals need to apply. No more anchor babies, no welfare, no WIC for the first five years they are here. They must be self-supporting. They need to have a sponsor
@AnnCoulter Birds of a feather hang out together.
@nytimes Has she tried wing walking to protest?
@FoxNews @SenatorCardin Explain what are sensible immigration laws? You talk but never say anything. Explain what you mean.
@FoxNews @SenatorCardin So says the Senator from Maryland. What does he know about people running through his backyard? Does he have a wall around his own house, if so, why? Let him open his house to everyone that wants to stop by for a snack, borrow his car, take a shower, or get whatever they want.
@washingtonpost Go back to the original "I Agree" you checked on Affordable Care Act enrollment. Around line 4000 of the agreement it said "there is no reasonable expectation of privacy on this website." Pelosi said they must pass it to find out what is in it, but they didn't tell you. Lured in.
@chuckwoolery For that answer take a good look at the VA.
@realDonaldTrump Now that looks like a well behaved mob. No hidden faces, people helping others, waiting in line like civilized people. Thank God Hillary doesn't see this, she would be upset at the deplorables.
@BreitbartNews Fake News, another CNN outlet.
@FoxNews Look out Mexico, you have invaders entering your southern border. Do you need help keeping them out?
@TaubGVWire @DevinNunes @JanzforCongress @OpenSecretsDC @USHouseNews @Campaignmag @realFireNunes @TalCloud @LincolnFresno @FresnoCountyGOP @DanielMorain Isn't it nice that Janz is spending so much to help the Valley out? I hope he has more to spend even though Devin Nunes should win. He is the better candidate.
@OfficialLivePD I wish that LivePD could give a wrap up of what happens to some of the individuals that are caught and have results from their cases. Great show, addicted to it.
@JerryMoran Just like the Senate did for Justice Kavanaugh. What about his fundamental rights?
@CRTV @realDonaldTrump Maybe not hardened criminal but when they try to cross they will be criminals. Build the wall, obey the laws. Zero Tolerance. Immediate deportation. If you don't like the Presidents answers, quit asking questions. Do like some of the others, stay home and make it up. Fake News.
@w_terrence Does the father know?
@RepJimCosta @TIME Don't forget about Democratic values in our own land! https://t.co/UhIuRhOCdq
@DevinNunes It would be nice if they could arrest him for stalking, then we could find out who he is.
@RepAdamSmith @AAUWActionFund What about men and families or is it the men and their families just don't matter?
@RepDennyHeck @HRC What about the people who are overweight. They are discriminated against and you are doing nothing to help them. Airlines seats are just a part of it.
@RepBrady @HRC What about the people who are overweight. They are discriminated against and you are doing nothing to help them. Airlines seats are just a part of it.
@washingtonpost Bring back zero tolerance, build the wall, obey the laws. Don't like it, go away.
@GavinNewsom @realDonaldTrump Build the Wall, obey the laws. Zero Tolerance. Not their country it is our country. You don't like it stay away. Immediate deportation back to Mexico, even if you come from Honduras, send them back to the last country they went through.
@GavinNewsom @realDonaldTrump What about your policy not to protect the citizens of the United States. You are protecting the illegal aliens more than you are protecting the citizens. If they don't want to be subject to our laws then stay away. If you don't like it, tough, obey the laws and it won't happen.
@realDonaldTrump Democrats do not want laws, they want power. They want people to be beholding to them. Build the Wall, enforce the laws, zero tolerance. This is our country and if they want to come here do it the correct way. Get in line and apply to come here. Wait your turn.
@SenSchumer Why don't you stop illegal aliens from invading our country?
@SenSanders Where is the data to back up that devasting report? We hear reports but nothing to back it up. We want the data to see for ourselves. reports are meaningless without the data. BS until you can prove it. Where is the data? Get off the reports and give us the data?  Verifiable data
@CNN We definitely could have every American employed if we didn't have so many illegal aliens in this country. No more crap about them doing jobs Americans won't do. I am an OWG and I have been a farm worker, busboy, dishwasher, janitor, taxi driver, military, electronics technician.
@CNN Don't spend too much and keep your budget down and one-job is enough. I was in the military and I sometimes had to get a part-time job. You do what you have to do to survive and get what you want. If you don't like your job or it doesn't pay enough go find another job.
@BreitbartNews Like stormy hasn't called men hurtful names. I think porn-star is much worse than horseface. At least a horse's face has some dignity in the looks. Porn-star doesn't.
@SenatorCantwell Are they getting rid of the stupid diversity requirements?
@NRSC @HillaryClinton @SenatorMenendez Was she driving?
@Jcsleeper1 @bennyjohnson Not chiefspreadingbull, but princeszsspreadthebull, Princessspreadthebull.
@Jcsleeper1 @bennyjohnson Not chiefspreadingbull, but princeszsspreadthebull.
@cnni Blame it on the parents. If you don't want to obey our laws don't come here. Zero Tolerance, immediate deportation back to Mexico. Our country not theirs. Build the wall. Apply for entry, do not invade our country.
@BBCWorld Cut away, our country, not theirs. Zero Tolerance. If you don't want to do it the correct way don't come. We don't need any more invaders.
@SenatorDurbin you yak, yak, yak, and yak. What would you do? You really don't say.
@GavinNewsom I don't want the tax cut to pay for themselves. I want the tax cuts to force you to spend less. Use the taxes for American citizens not the illegal aliens. Less pay raises for peop0-le that just sleep on the job (i.e. CA DMV) Spend on it ems that have returns such as the Wall!
@MikeHeron8 Anatowa honto baca. I think you need to go back and do your research again. Humans are designated in three major races, black, white and Asian. Native  Ame4rican fall in the Asian category since they crossed on the land bridges up near Alaska. If you want to speak German go ahead
@NancyPelosi @92YOnDemand How many ways can we spell BS. If you wanted an affordable care act model with a single payer system just look at the VA. It has many parts that are broken and it is impossible to get fixed. If a vet wants to go to an outside facility they have to jump through hoops.
@MikeHeron8 yeah, yeah, you said it before. If you really wqnt to get technical since the DNA of Native Americans is asian then maybe we should all speak Korean, Japanese or Chinese. Meanwhile back in the present we need to have a common language and the USA can be English.
@GAYN3RD @SenKamalaHarris Oh, they get benefits. !. They get to stay here. 2. They get in-state tuition for college. 3. They get free medical when they go to the ER. 4. They get free education in our public schools. We even teach them ESL. No benefits?
@chuckwoolery @BreitbartNews Bill Clinton is already hexed, look who he married. Cory Booker better watch out. They are gong after Bret “and upon all rapists and the patriarchy which emboldens, rewards and protects them.” Since Bret is not a rapist he is okay, but poor Bill.
@SenKamalaHarris Are they going to allow illegal aliens to sign up for it? Why should be using our tax dollars to help someone who will not even obey our laws? Why do they get any benefit? If you want to come here do it correctly! Build the wall, obey the laws. Zero tolerance!
@CNN Build the Wall. Obey the laws. Immediate enforcement of zero tolerance! Safety and security first. Who are they? No criminals need to apply. No more anchor babies, no welfare, no WIC for the first five years they are here. They must be self-supporting. They need to have a sponsor
@cnni Build the Wall. Obey the laws. Immediate enforcement of zero tolerance! Safety and security first. Who are they? No criminals need to apply. No more anchor babies, no welfare, no WIC for the first five years they are here. They must be self-supporting. They need to have a sponsor
@FoxNews Let them in AFTER all those wanting to come here legally are let in! Before letting them in they must wait in line to make sure no one else wants to come here, then they provide complete documentation of who they are and why they want to come here. No anchor babies, no welfare.
@ElizabethHeng He can't be bothered by working for American Citizens. There are too many illegal aliens he needs to get across the border. Build the wall, enforce the Laws! Zero Tolerance! Protect and secure America! Make English the Official language. Have voting ballots in English only!
@LincolnFresno You see they don't tell their constituents where they will be so we can let them know how we feel. I have been trying to call but for some reason, she never answers the phone. can you really trust someone who looks at you over the glasses?
@Mimi1213R @foxandfriends Maybe that is why you don't see her outside when it rains.
@w_terrence Yep, the Democrats need to go back to school to learn English but do not go to school in Taxifornia. You may come out dumber than you went in. At the rate it is going they may also try ESL.
@SenateGOP We need to get all the vacant positions filled. We also need more immigration judges to clear the backlog of illegal aliens in the country. Democrats get off your a**es and start working for the American people. We need security and safety in our own country!
@ElizabethHeng Have you tried to speak on some of the college campuses?
@SenSanders If you go to vote and your name is not registered and was before, do 4 things. 1st Make sure you're not in Taxifornia. 2nd Fill out a provisional ballot. 3rd Notify your voter registrars office and finally notify your congressman, senator, newspapers radio and TV.
@RealJamesWoods Feinstein, You went to Washington without consulting me. If you had I would have told you stay home and do it my way. I voted in good faith, but you didn't listen to me either. Start working for the American people and not the illegal aliens, build the wall. Zero tolerance!
@DineshDSouza Donna Brazile, the lady who cheats. She needs to read what her party is doing to blacks. Does she agree with the statements and feelings of those who are spouting off on CNN? Talk about hate speech. Maybe it is time to take the N word off the hate speech profile. Check with CNN.
@foxandfriends How much is the church charging? What good are these cards? Are they recognized by any government? If so, why? If they are just for the church, are they doing it for profit? How do they validate the people who get one? Do they just take the information faith? They are criminals!
@BetoORourke What do you consider a perfect union? Do we all split what we earn? Why would we want you lead us? Are you worthy of leading us? I don't think so. What I earn I want to keep. Lower taxes, no socialism, Freedom and safety in my own country. Get rid of the illegal aliens and gangs.
@Red_Velvet_Seat No flag, no movie.
@RealJamesWoods BooHoo, It was hurtful. Get over it, lady. Life can be very hurtful. Don't you think what you and Feinstein did wasn't hurtful? What you did was not only hurtful but mean and devious. You and Feinstein set out to deliberately hurt someone who didn't deserve it. Hurtful, Hah!
@OhSoCali @RealJamesWoods Not with the Taxifornia DMV. They are having so many problems that they are getting an audit. The only problem with the audit is that they are doing it themselves. The inmates are running the prison.
@RealJamesWoods Are they kidding? They know that illegal aliens are voting in the election and the DMV is compliciate in the act. Get rid of motor voter, cut down on the use of mail in ballots, no internet voting, have everyone reregister and bring proof of citizenship. Create a voter ID.
@amandalitman @runforsomething @SenGillibrand Is that another bar she is at?
@KarenRi07750556 I really thought that was a girl until he started speaking. Maybe the purple hair or the big glasses. could be both. Too bad they can't arrest him for language. He is lucky he in Seattle. Hillary talk about civility, Ha!
@cnni If I had a store I would put a sign in the windows that would say "English Speaks Here!" and then wait for someone to sue me. I need the money.
@washingtonpost If they don't want to go to school then kick them out and let others in who want the school. They want to protest then go see the kneeler. Maybe he can them some tips on how to make themselves look stupid if they really need help in that area.
@w_terrence Wait till they find out your view was the right one.
@nicholas__james @ManscapedGents It depends on what you swallowed.
@TheDemocrats Get out and vote, we need more Republicans in the Senate and in Congress. Take back our country and make it great again. No more Mob rule!
@chinabeach59 @HillaryClinton BOWW
@JudicialWatch Convict and lock up.
@RepJimCosta @fresnocity @ABC30 I would like to see you put a bill before Congress to make English the official language. I would also like to see voting ballots in English only, no other languages on the ballots.
@RWPUSA How did you get your money?
@GOP BOWM.
@AMike4761 Here is a prime example of BOWW (Bitter Old White Woman).
@AMike4761 OK, PETA where are you? This would definitely be one for you to protest.
@washingtonpost Being that cartoon is from Taxifornia how do we know it is not a female asking a male for a hug?
@ArizonaKayte Yes, it is not was, it is in the 1000's.
@ArizonaKayte Don't worry they are being audited, by themselves.
@JasonCalvi As Nelson would say: Ha Ha!
@cnni @CillizzaCNN Where are the facts? No more theories or conjectures, just the facts.
@Jamierodr10 She needs to be treated equally. Arrest her.
@SenSanders What about the people who don't want to work for a union? Why would they have to sign up with a union to have a job? I don't like their politics and they take our money to give to politicians we don't like. That cuts into our freedom of speech. My money goes to those I like.
@SenSanders Bernie, you can help by not driving or riding in a car, plane, train or boat. Please start today. Please cut back on your use of electricity by turning off your TV, Computers and all electronic devices. Let us know when you have done all that. Use the semaphore flags to tell us.
@DamasiusPugnax @RealJamesWoods He is actually sticking his tongue out as he does this. He is lucky someone did hit his jaw at that time.
@ODGHITLERMETHH1 @SenSanders And it is screaming no less.
@ODGHITLERMETHH1 @SenSanders Spell checker and autocorrect went haywire and gave birth to gobblygoop.
@SenSanders Rise Up For: The Constitution? I thought that is what you fighting against. Everything you talk about goes against the grain of the Constitution. We don't want socialism. We want what we work for. Your belief is taxation without responsibility.
@jylegoff @SteveKingIA Only late because the Democrats will not help. It is not a GOP fail but a Democratic block, so far.
@SteveKingIA I have worked on farms when I was younger. I am an OWG. Cleaning out corn silos are no fun!
@AMike4761 It may have been the religious police. You know the ones who also tell you to keep your dogs inside so as not offend.
@jennflairty @CNN I gave up giggling, it makes me sound like a mad scientist instead of just mad.
@DonaldJTrumpJr At least he did it in this century. Really do need to keep him there a  bit longer, like 5 or 10 more years. I guess since he is a Democrat and ranks up there with Bill Clinton, he gets a break. Parents watch what your daughters are getting on their phones! Carlos Danger is back!
@jennflairty @CNN Happens to me all the time. I use MS word then copy and paste into Twitter some of the time. Fewer mistakes but more work.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse 2/2 If you don't like the laws then work on getting them changed. There are some laws which people don't like but they are needed so before changing them take a good long hard look at them to make sure that they need changing. No spur of the moment, feel-good changes!
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse 1/2 I would like them to talk about law reform instead reforming the prisons. In Taxifornia we need to get our laws reformed so they have teeth. They might even want to build a few more prisons. It is said we have too many prisoners, well, stop breaking the laws. Obey them.
@washingtonpost Leave? No, let go would be appropriate. Teachers are there to teach not indoctrinate. If they want to do indoctrination then apply for a job in China.
@BretBaier Wrong their, there. There is correct.
@NaomiLevinNY Any relation to Mark Levin?
@jennflairty @CNN Thanks. Also for the kids have them try reading Isacc Asimov, the Robot Series. There is one book that examines our culture very well and these were written in the 50's.
@CNN @camanpour Thats ok, your breathing is political. Eneve your "acting" is political. I know your good at it because all acting is getting someone to believe you are someone else through manipulation,
@PrisonPlanet As a elderly disable guy I would feel very threatened by their actions and would do whatever to protect myself. The police appear to be doing nothing but they watching from a little ways down the road there. I guess they are waiting to arrest normal citizen for rioting.
@AmandaLeeHouse @KelleyAshbyPaul Do some states require that a gun be unloaded and in a safe when in the house? I'm not completely sure if Taxifornia requires that a gun be locked up or not.
@nytimes 2/2 People don't want to pay higher prices so they will go elsewhere to shop which cuts into profits. So is taken from other benfits which don't affect profits. Be very careful what you wish for!
@nytimes 1/2 Be careful what you wish for! Somethings are true. Companies don't want to lose profit so when you get a raise it has to come from somewhere else other than profits. Higher prices, less benefits and such areas.
@jennflairty @CNN As far as getting high, don't need or want it. I am just trying to enjoy the raw enjoyment of the grandkids.
@jennflairty @CNN I was just passing on the info from the San Francisco Chronicle. I have not used any of it since the 70's in Southeast Asia. It may be the way you say, if so the SF Chronicle is misinforming the poeple. I have been looking at it, do you know if there are any health benefits?
@nytimes Can we please get the data the scientist used to calculate the climate change forecast? There are a few of us who don't have a degree but do know how to use the data. We just don't have the access to the raw data that we need to make up our own minds. As you say: Transparency.
@washingtonpost Opinion: She stood tall.
@MTR_EpicWin77 Love that fish. Jealous!
@chuckwoolery Can't we get them for trying to destroy government property?
@chuckwoolery I guess I need to apologize for being old, white, male and poor. I don't think it will matter how much I apologize some people will never be satisfied, so forget the apology!
@jennflairty @CNN In California, CBD derived from regulated and taxed cannabis is legal,  available in psychoactive and non-psychoactive lab-tested products. It is sold in state-licensed cannabis stores, often priced higher than other products rich in THC. (from San Francisco Chronicle 10/8/18)
@DiamondandSilk I am still waiting for the Democrats to tell us what they are going to impeach him for. Does anybody know?
@MarkYoungTruth She pissed me off also and to me, you are considered a young thing. My high school days started in the 60's. I got my first drivers license in 1968 and my first shotgun in 1966. I was running the bars in 1970. I can still remember what I did last month. I would go with liar.
@MarkYoungTruth As far as I can tell it is people like Sanders his ilk want you to feel bad about being rich. I don't have enough between paydays but I definitely don't hold it against you. You may be helping with my occasional jobs for all I know. You don't need to apologize for a thing!
@SenGillibrand Propaganda and fake news!
@Liberty8691 @jumbywumby @KimVanMunching @MrAndyNgo @tedwheeler Big ugly worm
@CNN Just what we need, more mind-altering drinks.
@SenSchumer 2/2 You don't believe the FBI or Justice Kavanaugh, what are you going to do. Make up more lies? You say he lied during his testimonies, what are those lies? Spell them out, no more innuendos!
@SenSchumer 1/2 What I saw were women coming across America to try to railroad an innocent person. I did see other women coming from across America to defend him. Why don't you mention that? Defend the innocent, 35-year-old accusations need proof.
@JRehling it would have been nice to have satellites back then.
@MattWalshBlog First black slave in the new world was John Castor, the first slave owner in the new world was Anthony Johnson, a black Angolan. Christopher Columbus had nothing to do with slavery. Don't learn history then it will be repeated. Don't repeat history.
@cynthetta @MoxyCoxy24 @karlyherron @bennyjohnson How many times do you misspell words? Those that don't misspell and don't use autocorrect can throw the word corrections around. CLAM (Calm)
@SwidanDeborah @RightWingLawMan @WhiteHatGuy @TheDemocrats I would like to see us going back to civility, where men hold the doors, pull out chairs, etc for women. Some want that, some don't. Men are confused by everything we hear. No matter what we do some women will be offended. Those that are offended by manners, get over it. Tired.
@SwidanDeborah @RightWingLawMan @WhiteHatGuy @TheDemocrats If that were a man doing the keying fists would be flying. Since she is a woman man have to stand there and take it. Where is the equality in that? What do women really want? Will somebody please let the men know? No matter what we do it is wrong. HELP!
@SwidanDeborah @RightWingLawMan @WhiteHatGuy @TheDemocrats What has being an angry girlfriend got to do with it? Does her being a woman give her an excuse? I thought men were supposed to treat women the same as another man? If we treat women the same then we are insensitive. If we cry instead lashing out we are considered too emotional.
@SirhindiRobert @SenateDems @SenJeffMerkley I am well versed in the immigration system. My mother, Ex-wife and current wife are immigrants. I am trying to get my stepson &amp; his daughters here at this time. Trying to do it legally is frustrating &amp; I am tired of the illegal aliens getting here before them. Info helps. Thanks.
@JerryBrownGov I want to know who these scientists are and how we the people can get in touch with them?
@jxjarvix @LincolnFresno @stevebrandau @BrookeAshjian Space X helping us along. Launched from Vandenberg AFB.
@MarkYoungTruth Have they done a probe on your driver yet? When is the public going to hear about it? Is he getting a retirement check? If so, from whom? Does he still report to his Chinese handlers? Do you send him birthday and Christmas cards?
@RealCandaceO @taylorswift13 @MarshaBlackburn I am disheartened. I now no longer have the desire to listen to her songs. Towing the Democratic lie that women aren't believed and are treated with no respect. I urge you to watch Cops and Live PD sometime &amp; watch how different women are treated compared to the men.
@elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump Do you think ypou will ever hold a beer summit like Obama did? Maybe you will just sit around and smoke a pipe? At least he is better than your hero Hillary.
@SirhindiRobert @SenateDems @SenJeffMerkley Our system does work but many just don't like it. I think we need to enforce the laws correctly. When a person comes here illegally they need to sent back to where the crossed the border not the originating country. That would force Mexico into controlling their border.
@SirhindiRobert @SenateDems @SenJeffMerkley The first thing we need with immigration reform is to enforce the lawzs we already have. Then secure the border. Everybody that comes into the country needs to be identified. Background, health, economic checks also need to be done. We don't need any more gangsters or such here.
@SirhindiRobert @SenateDems @SenJeffMerkley Why not, we are talking about the safety and security of the country. Eminent domain has been used for many things that are less important such as shopping malls and park lots. This a defintie time for eminent domain. I have heard some of the people on the border wanting the wall
@RWPUSA You need to talk to your good buddy Feinstein who gives insider information to hubby. Any other citizen would be in jail for what she does, but the senators have a special exemption on that. Look it up.
@CNN Was that poll taken before or after the release of the Putin calendar? A lot of Russian women liked that calendar.
@CNN Gov Brown needs to be on that poll. He thinks he is a world leader. I know that's only in his mind, but we need to give Moonbeam a break as he leads California down the garden path.
@CNN Tired of polls trying to tell me what to think. Where is Kim Jung Un on that poll? What about Gov Jerry Brown? You didn't say who was polled. Was it people in their own country or others looking in?
@SirhindiRobert @SenateDems @SenJeffMerkley Why do people who cross the border illegally get a break but those who try to come here the correct way have to wait so long?
@SirhindiRobert @SenateDems @SenJeffMerkley We build it on the US side, Say about 50 feet in. We need to also get rid of the anchor baby rule. Make it at least one of the parents need to be here legally. My wife is trying to get her son here legally but he currently on the waiting list which currently is at 11 years.
@Marty_Seaward @GregGutfeldShow Don't forget California.
@PrisonPlanet I think if that was me i would have tripped and fell on the so called lady.
@WileGenius @kwhitchcock @RealJamesWoods Don't forget the defense: "I went to public school in California."
@Brett_Kavanagh You can change it.
@SenSanders Tell me, would you feel the same way if he were part of the hard left?
@SenateDems @SenJeffMerkley We want people to come here but they need to obey our laws and do it correctly. Do not try to jump the line. We need to know everything about them. Their names, health conditions, educations, their beliefs, everything. We do not need gangbangers, murderers, thieves or their ilk.
@SenateDems @SenJeffMerkley One big way to tell how the Democrats worry about their power is the way they do not want the wall built for the safety and security of the American people. They seem to worry more about illegal aliens than they do American citizens. We need to stop this invasion. Built the wall!
@SenateDems @SenJeffMerkley all the Democrats worry about is their power, not the American citizens or even women. They want to get their laws passed through and not be held accountable for them. The GOP needs to get out and vote against all the Democrats who don't care about them.
@SenateDems @SenJeffMerkley If the accusations are not credible and cannot be verified then they need to fear. If the allegations can be verified then they will be believed. Innocent till proven guilty. Not guilty by accusations. The Democrats need to learn that and try to live by that rule.
@IngrahamAngle I have no idea how you reached a conclusion like that. Being a Christian does not mean giving up and that is what you are telling him to do. He needs to stand up and be strong in his faith and accept the nomination and do his best. Judge using the constitution not popular opinion
@AMike4761 Yes, stop all aid to them and pull out of there. Try to get all the Christians out of there but do a complete check before bringing them here. Remember the Muslins have said they will lie to defeat their enemies. They say American is the Great Satan &amp; that is another lie they use
@NancyPelosi Women marched, women are running, women will win, and hopefully, Nancy Pelosi will retire.
@FoxNews @chalcax has it correct. Nobody cares about a helmet. What is the helmet was green, would she advocating for Martians. It matches her outfit and looks good on her. It would look lousy on me because it is not my style. Style is the keyword.
@SenGillibrand Do senate democrats believe women? Not hardly. Look at the women who accused Billy boy of sexual assault. What did you do for them? Nothing. Remember the blue dress!
@chinabeach59 Which one is which?
@foxandfriends Build the wall and charge 3% on all money transaction going across the southern border to pay for the wall. Protect America. Protect American Citizens. Safety first. Verify all those who want to come here. Zero Tolerance. If they don't like it, tough! Americans first!
@kathygriffin @SenatorCollins You really need to clean your keyboard. It looks like you have some keys that are sticking. It could also be some of the foam coming out of your mouth while you are typing.
@TheDemocrats Where is the proof that the White House refused to allow the FBI to interview them? Didn't the FBI have the ability to interview them but decided not to because of the testimonies were given in the Senate under oath? If they change their story then it would be perjury. Change?
@BernieSanders @fightfor15 Put their bodies on the line. I hope you are saying that the formed a line. Anything other than that is laughable.
@SenBlumenthal You talking about trustworthiness. Hah! How can the American people trust you when you lie about your service. Not a fudge but an outright lie. Veterans know when they been to war or not. Apparently, you don't.
@SenBlumenthal Where are the pictures from inside? How do we know this is the place you toured? You have lied before, could you be lying now? We want proof, not hearsay. Quit lying and do your job for the American people!
@joanesh @DonaldJTrumpJr Actually, that was done by the Clintons.
@trumpsuckbigly @RWPUSA Oh, ok, my mind did not go there at all. LOL
@SenSanders I, too, mock Dr. Ford. She did not seem credible at all. Further information from her ex-boyfriend and other friends do not hold up to what she has said. She needs to be looked at for perjury.
@chuckwoolery Hurry up and get that wall up. We need it for the security of the country and safety of American citizens. It will also help in the fight of the opioid crisis and help in getting more jobs to the American citizen. The legal immigrants will also get a benefit out of the wall.
@FoxNews If all you want are the antlers then get a 3D printer and make your own. To kill an animal for a trophy, then let them practice goring you. That would be fun entertainment.
@dbongino She and those of her ilk think that laws are going to stop criminals from getting weapons. There are many ways to get weapons including building them yourself. The only way to stop some of these killings is to enforce laws that have consequences such as the death penalty.
@BreakingNLive Why is this news?
@FoxNews Bring back the zero-tolerance policy and build the wall!
@TheDemocrats Make English the official language of the United States.
@BreakingNLive Take the advice of your Hawaiian friend: shut up and man up. Learn to live with it. Kavanaugh is not guilty.
@tedlieu Take the advice of your Hawaiian friend: shut up and man up. Learn to live with it. Kavanaugh is not guilty.
@SenWarren Take the advice of your Hawaiian friend: shut up and woman up.
@SenSanders All this increase in pay is going to do its raise the cost of everything except the money of those who are on fixed incomes such as the disabled and elderly. Give your money away and get a disability check for less than 1700 and then we can talk, till then go away.
@SenSanders Crawl back into your hole. We don't need a socialist trying to ruin our country. You couldn't even live in a commune you were so bad, they kicked you out. That is really bad.
@HeyTammyBruce I would like a gofundme page and every citizen donate 5 cents to it. That would be enough for me to get out of debt and own a house and a car. Oh well, it is just a dream.
@GallantGrl @ChristianRep @SenFeinstein Ok, I understand you want him to have more power.
@SenSchumer Everybody jumps all over Judge Kavanaugh for saying he likes beer. Remember Obama and tales of parties and even his famous beer summit at the White House. And yes, Obama did drugs and even smoked. OMG Clinton smoked but did not inhale. Huh?m That is like I looked but did not see.
@SenSchumer I don't know who you were watching but I did not see a credible woman making the accusations. Further revelations have helped confirm that. Did not know that the Senate offered to go to her. Hah, it was on the radio, TV, Social Media and papers since it was first offered.
@CNN well, we know he wasn't a Clinton.
@BeeCast805 @KyleKashuv @Alyssa_Milano @DonaldJTrumpJr just because she didn't tell doesn't mean it happened.
@SebGorka @LisaMarieBoothe Don't forget about Obama and his beer summit.
@lisastark351 Let me get straight...I should care about Harvard, Yale, Georgetown whose degrees only mean the people had money and needed their children indoctrinated?
@TheDemocrats Let's help the Democrats. They need to go home and face the people they have let down. Vote GOP and especially for President Trump supported candidates. Help protect America, vote the Democrats out and build the Wall. Help secure America, vote the Democrats out and build the Wall
@SenGillibrand I don't know everybody that I am with when a picture is taken, do you?
@TheDemocrats They are not immigrants they are the children of illegal alien invaders. If you want to come here, do it correctly. Obey our laws and don't think you are any better than anyone else. You are not. If you don't want to obey our laws then stay away!
@mmchugh310 @nbcsnl Not much make-up is needed.
@StephenAtHome Blame it on the parents of illegal alien border crossers. Don't break our laws. come here correctly. If you get caught and you are already been in trouble here you will go to jail &amp; your kids will be taken from you just like it is done to American citizens throughout the country.
@RealCandaceO @ChrisEvans who is this Chris Evans character? What does he do? Is he even worth listening to? I have asked my friends and don't know him either. It is a him, correct?
@charliekirk11 If I am not mistaken but California also ranks 49th in education.
@SenGillibrand Donate now, They are just now learning how to panhandle. I may donate if they say they will definitely leave public life and go hide in a corner.
@FarRightGirl @SenFeinstein Calling an AR-15 an assault weapon is like putting a sleek fiberglass body on a Volkswagen and calling it a speed racer.
@SenFeinstein What assault weapon was legally purchased?
@CNN @CNNOpinion You mean it will help me better understand how much you should be paying prostitutes? Does it give us a menu list?
@RepJimCosta I noticed you said we've made progress. What did you do to help the progress? Working for the illegal aliens is not progress. Now you help progress if you help President Trump by getting the wall built. That would help with the progress in America.
@FoxNews @JeffFlake @FBI We need more competence fewer flakes.
When I was in the military I used the USO and they are great. They are the ones that bring the troops' entertainment overseas and coffee places in some airports. I have seen some of the USO shows that included Bob Hope. We NEED them! Thanks! https://t.co/inamPqyvDr
@HillaryClinton I hear Murphy Brown is looking for a new secretary.
@gmartinz @ElizabethHeng At least that is more than you would get from the current congressman.
@FoxNews @amyklobuchar Duh, where have you been? President Trump has already said there is no limit on the scope. I would put a limit on it, however. Only investigate the facts.
@SenWarren I can't make it to the meeting on Monday because I am afraid to fly. Sen Feinstein, I will be glad to meet with you when I get back from my mid-Atlantic trip on Aug 10, 2018. Nobody told me that you would come out to California to talk to me. TV, Radio, what are they?
@SenWarren It is kind of hard to investigate when there is not much to investigate. When? I don't know. Where? I don't know. Who? Kavanaugh, but no witnesses and nobody remembers the party. What is the conclusion? Nothing to investigate here.
@ChuckCallesto Nothing to say that has not already been said. Is Flake still there? I am waiting for that snowflake to melt away.
@RepMaxineWaters Mark Judge did the same thing Dr. Ford "witnesses" did. He submitted a letter in writing under perjury if he was lying. If a guy doesn't want to appear the left says he has something to hide. If a woman doesn't want to appear she is afraid of harassment. Where is the fairness?
@thecaptain18078 @CNN @CNNOpinion LOL
@thecaptain18078 @CNN @CNNOpinion Did you notice most of the complaints came from old white women?
@thecaptain18078 @CNN @CNNOpinion The GOP needs to get a stiff backbone and start working for their constituents and not their own pockets and illegal aliens. (My complaint of choice)
@CNN @lisaling Help stop PART of the meth problem, build the wall.
@RepMaxineWaters with your actions be careful what you wish for. Abdicating violence is not the answer.
@thecaptain18078 Your profile looks like fun but the one with lightning is a good reason to run. fascinating none the less.
@thecaptain18078 @CNN @CNNOpinion This actually needs no fairness just the truth, She accused him so she should be ready to handle the results whatever they are. I am sure her insurance can handle the breakdown.
@CNN @CNNOpinion 2/2 Judge Kavanaugh was grilled relentlessly even asking about his yearbook on flatulence &amp; vomiting. Dr. Ford had no evidence of what happened to her but Judge Kavanagh had evidence he did not do it. We could go into all of that but the left will not listen.
@CNN @CNNOpinion 1/2 Nice try CNN with your fake news. Apparently, you didn't listen to the questions that have been going on for at least 2 weeks. I too would cry because if I leashed out physically I would be in jail in a heartbeat. Dr. Ford was treated with kid gloves the whole time.
@IngrahamAngle If she has children, I wonder what they think of her now?
@GrayForAssembly How can people on a fixed income such as Social Security be able to afford a new "Clean" vehicle? The people on fixed income cannot afford the high price of the clean vehicles and usually those on fixed also have no so great credit ratings. Due to taxes going up.
@GrayForAssembly They need to hybrids more than electric. It makes more sense and provides the people with the freedom to move around more than the electric cars do. Do not track us by mileage. Take the money we pay into taxes and fix everything first before bringing new projects online.
@therealjapeth @MarkYoungTruth A Phobia does not go away just because you are on vacation. She could not remember whether she paid for the lie detector test or not. All the people she said were there have denied knowing about it, and that is under penalty of perjury. Mark Judge also denied it. Stepping forward
@therealjapeth @MarkYoungTruth I am stepping forward by calling out what is wrong. Dr. Ford couldn't remember where the incident occurred and not even the date. She could not remember what she did 3 weeks ago. She said she is afraid to fly but she would fly all over the place on vacation.
@SenFeinstein Did you check with the Chinese Spy driver? He may have the answers for you?
@SenFeinstein Look at Dr. Ford lifetime job: paid appearance, book deals, and celebrity status, but that may all come to an end if she is debunked.
@IngrahamAngle There are some old white women I am getting tired of: Nancy Pelosi, Dianne Feinstein, Joy Behar, Kamala Harris are just a few.
@JaneMayerNYer No delay - Vote NOW!
@McFaul Do you think that it might be Dr. Ford who is lying?
@AMike4761 Sen Feinstein is looking for a new driver.
@SenGillibrand I have no idea what show you were watching.
@DiamondandSilk if you go to other sites with of the video you see it was actually two envelopes, white and the other light blue. Sheila Jackson Lee's office said it was from women who wanted to get into the hearings. Yeah, right. Why isn't the attorney asked about the envelopes? Look into it.
@DiamondandSilk Now here an item that needs an FBI investigation.
@FoxNews @KamalaHarris Sen Harris thinks a woman being a woman is bravery and courage. She really admires people who lie for her benefit.
@drawandstrike I object to Blumenthal opening his mouth.
@TheDemocrats She was just there for a job interview. Paid appearances and a book deal.
@FoxNews @ChuckGrassley She says she did not know that the interview could have been held in California. That is complete BS. That option has been all over every news station and broadcast for almost a week. BS and a lie.
@AllenWest @SenKamalaHarris This is not a hearing, it is a job interview.
@Emma_Dumain @LindseyGrahamSC Who, was the woman? Did you get her name? when did it happen? You should be getting that information if you are going to throw it out there.
@KimStrassel She is currently on a job interview for celebrity status. She wants paid appearances and book deals.
@Emma_Dumain @LindseyGrahamSC That is the correct thing to do. Politicians are not the police. Police will take the report and start the investigations.
@Lrihendry I am trying to figure out since Dr. Ford cannot remember things that happened this month how can she remember things correctly from 36 years ago.
@RealCandaceO Don't forget Brian Banks.
@RealCandaceO According to the FBI, about 95,000 forcible rapes were reported in 2004. Based on the statements and studies cited above, some 47,000 American men are falsely accused of rape each year.
@RepJoeKennedy She is currently on a job interview for celebrity status. She wants paid appearances and book deals.
@FoxNews Did Dr. Ford work in Hawaii? If so how did she get there? She says she is afraid of flying and that was the main reason for not being in DC on Monday. I think it was just another delaying tactic. Vote for confirmation this afternoon.
@chromeit3 @RV1026 @FilmJen @CNNPolitics You know I can believe that.
@chromeit3 @RV1026 @FilmJen @CNNPolitics I myself don't have an answer to that, do you know? Thanks.
@RepSwalwell Nothing to gain? Why is it I cannot get a high profile public forum to say what happened to me in high school? Just because I am male does not make it less traumatizing. I want the celebrity status and money for appearances and book deals I will get. Please let me testify.
@RepSwalwell Rings of Truth? I say great job interview. She wants to get paid appearances and a great book deal. Maybe even a movie deal. Great interview.
@sjcloobeck Are you talking about Illegal Aliens or legal immigrants? Be specific about it. Illegal Aliens should not be here and need to leave ASAP. Legal immigrants came the correct way. No more BS, say it correctly and the deal with the consequences.
@squattchie Maybe she pulled him onto the bed and felt guilty afterward. The brain is strange and it can change your memories if you believe it enough. Stranger things have happened. It can let you pass a lie detector test if you have a strong enough belief.
@thorne_andrea @glennbeck I am so sick of hearing this is a learning opportunity or a teachable moment. Why did she take so long in coming forward, 36 years ago is a little long to not report an attempt. Are sure she didn't pull him onto the bed and just reverse it in her mind?
@NancyPelosi Shouldn't you be saying thanks for the excellent job interview? You have definitely moved to the top for the new job.
@RV1026 @chromeit3 @FilmJen @CNNPolitics Exactly that is what Dr. Ford wants but with guys and maybe some girls. Not sure about that.
@FilmJen @CNNPolitics I take it you mean: why should we believe you? That is up to you to make up your own mind. I look at this of why it took so long and 36 years ago when she was a teenager. Are we sure she didn't pull him onto the bed herself and feels guilty and changed it in her mind?
@AndrewCMcCarthy She is currently on a job interview for celebrity status. She wants paid appearances and book deals.
@AndrewCMcCarthy Nothing to gain? Why is it I cannot get a high profile public forum to say what happened to me in high school? Just because I am male does not make it less traumatizing. I want the celebrity status and money for appearances and book deals I will get. Please let me testify.
@AndrewCMcCarthy Ok, let the FBI investigate. According to the FBI, about 95,000 forcible rapes were reported in 2004. Based on the statements and studies cited above, some 47,000 American men are falsely accused of rape each year.
@WilkowMajority Aw, come on, she is on a job interview. She wants to get celebrity status and be paid for appearances and book deals.
@marthamaccallum Don't harass her she is on a job interview. She wants to get celebrity status and be paid for appearances and book deals.
@CNNPolitics She is on a job interview. She wants to get celebrity status and be paid for appearances and book deals.
@CNNPolitics The same way I am sure I was talking to you on the phone, oh wait a minute I cannot get you, just your minions.
@SenFeinstein Careful what you wish for. You may be implicated in her stories.
@FoxNews LOL She works for the Democrats and she is on a job interview. She wants to get celebrity status and be paid for appearances and book deals.
@glennbeck She is on a job interview. She wants to get celebrity status and be paid for appearances and book deals.
@FoxNews She is on a job interview. She wants to get celebrity status and be paid for appearances and book deals.
@MarkYoungTruth She is on a job interview. She wants to get celebrity status and be paid for appearances and book deals.

@MarlynM3709 @marklevinshow Unfortunately how true.
@debbiebotto I am trying but dang Senators and congressmen won't listen to me. I just keep getting their minions.
@rachaelmbade Nothing to gain? Why is it I cannot get a high profile public forum to say what happened to me in high school? Just because I am male does not make it less traumatizing. I want the celebrity status and money for appearances and book deals I will get. Please let me testify.
@mj_lee Anyanghaseyo

@TheDemocrats Vote to confirm this afternoon!
@glennbeck Nothing to gain? Why is it I cannot get a high profile public forum to say what happened to me in high school? Just because I am male does not make it less traumatizing. I want the celebrity status and money for appearances and book deals I will get. Please let me testify.

@SenGillibrand I have heard many women on the radio and TV that do not have her back. Before you jump on me about that shouldn't those women also be believed?
@FoxNews @SenFeinstein Sen Feinstein mentions put under trial, I thought this was just hearing. So if it is a trial I want to hear them say she must prove his guilt. If he is innocent then who is being victimized. Dr. Ford is in it for the celebrity and the money, no doubt about that.
@ninja_leglamp @marklevinshow All I know now is when the media puts out the letters they are getting I swear I am reading something from Penthouse of the Hustler magazine.
@marklevinshow What I "love" about this whole thing is that it is Democratic Members of the Judiciary Committee that say he has to prove his innocence. For heaven's sake don't you know your own laws? You say it is not a criminal trial so give the Judge the presumption of innocence.
@SenFeinstein For you bring up Dr. Ford at the last minute is outrageous. Vote for confirmation now!
@jerbicbates @LindseyGrahamSC Don't forget Bill Clinton. He was doing it in the oval office while he was supposed to be working for us. President Trump was not the president at that time.
@BretBaier Can I file an injunction against his injunction? I want the vote to go forward with no more delays. Kyle Griffin has as much standing on this as I do, so my wishes should count just as much as his.
@TheOfficialPORP @realDonaldTrump Yes, that what you do. Pay prostitutes. She is nothing but a golddigger. President Trump had admitted to the affair whereas Judge Kavanaugh says he did not do it. Still, have not seen much of this third accuser &amp; it is amazing how they are coming out of the woodwork &amp; piling on. https://t.co/EDwayNQp5T
@SenSchumer Tell you what, Judge Kavanaugh can withdraw his consideration if you, Senator Feinstein, Cory Booker, Maxine Waters, Kamala Harris, and Kirsten Gillibrand resign and leave public service.
@FoxNews I hope they kept the receipts. Return them and go to Walmart.
@arawilson @Heminator I can't tell if you are talking about partying or sexting, but I do know personally they have been doing since the 50's on. Sexting didn't really start until after the turn of the century. Women need to be reminded that the pictures are out there for their kids to see.
@dbongino I feel so disrespected.
@Heminator Everybody has forgotten about all the teenage girls sexting.
@SenSanders Hey Bernie, Is it your money? No, it is his and has the right to spend it the way he wants. People voluntarily go to work for him. They are not indentured servants, they apply for the jobs. If they don't like it there they can to other places to work.
@catiedid3 @maziehirono Judge Kavanaugh's mother Judge Kavanagh foreclosed on Dr. Ford's parent's house.
@catiedid3 @maziehirono herein lies the crux, what if Judge Kavanaugh is telling the truth? Don't forget Dr. Ford has an ax to grind with the Kavanaugh family.
@StJimmySonofGun @IngrahamAngle uh huh.
@StJimmySonofGun @IngrahamAngle Uh huh.
@CalvinKlein Great with all the sexual abuse innuendos flying around we get to see a bunch of women in their underwear parading around. Great timing.
@RealSaavedra Notice he doesn't acknowledge the fact that Judge Kavanaugh may be telling the truth. What sleazeball. Don't forget about Brian Banks.
@BernieSanders Many people complain about our health system and much it costs the citizens but they forget to mention how much it costs the citizens of their own countries. They may not pay for it when they go but they pay a heck of a lot in taxes. The doctors do not work for free.
@StJimmySonofGun @IngrahamAngle The one that needs to be investigated is the accuser. Judge Kavanaugh has already been through 6 extensive FBI background investigations. I know what those investigations are like since I have had them myself. The FBI shows up everybody's door questioning them about you.
@IngrahamAngle @RichLowry @NRO Don't forget the story of Brian Banks.
@StJimmySonofGun @IngrahamAngle Accusations, not proof. Don't forget about the story of Brian Banks.
@IngrahamAngle Don't forget about the story of Brian Banks.
@LauraLoomer @realDonaldTrump Don't forget that some of those refugees will be getting Social security without paying into the system thereby causing it to run out of money earlier than it should. Check it out: https://t.co/6tQlKNa1OZ
@JMLoogman @ChrisDanielShow I think Rachel was upset about that. She was not invited.
@MunschyCraig @ChrisDanielShow That is ok because they still allow drinking and shooting up in public.
@TeamPelosi How did that work out for Brian Banks?
@Soli317 Is he guilty of what the say or is he innocent?
@ikerepublican @RWPUSA Thanks for the compliments. Is that a picture of yourself on your profile?
@RWPUSA Innocent until proven guilty by a court of law, not a court of public opinion.
@RepJimCosta @TBJFresno And this relates to you how? I want to see it when you say you have allocated more money to keep America safe by building the wall. If an illegal alien is identified being here then they need to leave. Convicted of a crime or not. Don't forget them being here is a crime.
@RepJoeKennedy I took a .look at what was referenced but they did not post the memo itself. They just said a few things about it. Post the memo itself so we can read it also. No more of the "just trust me mentality."
@SenSchumer Check out the story of Brian Banks and then say that.
@LouDobbs All you hear is believe the accuser because she is a woman. I invite you to look up the story of Brian Banks. Take a look and then say believe all accusers because they are women. Especially you, Senator Hirono.
@LoriDixon8 @CoryBooker But it is true, and that is supposed to be Yeah, right. The comma.
@HillaryClinton Register to vote Republican. Help keep people like Hillary Clinton out of politics. Help President Trump drain the swamp.
@MrJonCryer They are doing it republican nominees and being a male was just an extra topping.
@LoriDixon8 @CoryBooker Not desperate just trying to remind him of his actions while he is jumping all over Judge Kavanaugh.
@LincolnFresno Starting to pile on https://t.co/9K9hprL85V
@KMJNOW @clovisusd @DomMcAndrew I am curious why was it mentioned that the killer does not have a valid California drivers license? What kind of drivers license does he have? The way it was said leaves me to believe that there is more behind the story than just the lack of a drivers license.
@JudicialWatch Now having the FBI investigate Maxine Waters would be a good use of their time.
@PNS_CA Another California thing to spend more tax dollars. The people who have kids should already know of the responsibility they will incur. Make the families burden the costs, not the public. Families need to gather together to help raise the children. Take personal responsibility.
@CoryBooker Make sure you are registered to vote Republican. Help President Trump drain the swamp. Cory Booker, are you still groping 15-year-olds?
@JudicialWatch Build THE WALL long and high!
@CoryBooker Cory, are you still groping 15-year-olds?
@maziehirono Senator Hirono is on the Senate judiciary committee for The Constitution. She is the ranking member. She needs to be kicked off that committee if she doesn't believe in "innocent until proven guilty."
@maziehirono I believe that Dr. Ford is a shill of the Democratic party and an agent for George Soros. She also has an apparent memory problem, can't seem to remember the facts. Maybe she does really need to see a psychologist.
@TheDemocrats Register to vote Republican and help President Trump drain the swamp, especially of people like Senator Feinstein and Maxine Waters.
@TheDemocrats How many illegal aliens are the Democrats registering today? In California, the DMV said there was an error in the program causing the party of the some registered voters to change from Republicans to Democrat. How many illegal aliens were mistakenly registered to vote?
@CNN The real problem here is Senator Hirono is part of the Senate Judicial committee, the ones who make the laws. If she doesn't the in innocent until proven guilty, why is she making laws?
@dbongino While I agree that things like this should never happen, I would not call it racist. There needs to be a new word for those who hate the opposite view of the political spectrum. What many people do not realize is that most hispanics are caucasian (DNA wise).
@LindaWarriorGal AF brat before you were an AF brat, also an overseas AF brat.
@PhilaColumn What I want to happen is not good, but I feel it will happen someday soon. The left will get their just desserts.
@berniethoughts Go Miracle Whip!
@Rakulus101 @AGBecerra How are the power plants generating energy? Most of them burn coal. A few of them are hydroelectric. It would better with nuclear.
@RisingAsch i want to make some mini loaves and I have the mini loaf pan. Do you know a good recipe (and easy) for just regular old white bread?
@RisingAsch @TwoKidsAndAKite @FoxNews I have no idea who that tweet was for. I too own my own business. It is sometimes hard to do but I am making it.
@RepGosar Check on why refugees can get Social Security without ever paying into the system. Check https://t.co/6tQlKNa1OZ This is a Social Security document from their website.
@AGBecerra @EPAGov Last one of the day. Why did we need waivers in the past 40 years? Give us the details about them. The people of the state have the right to know. Maybe it is time to revoke some of them. What about the rights of the people in the state, shouldn't we know what you are doing?
@ShannonBream Gold diggers galore. they are coming out of the sewers. I have said it, so now prove me wrong. I should be believed also.
@NancyPelosi @FBI Judge Kavanaugh has had 6 FBI investigations already and they are very thorough. I have been through a couple so I know. Let's investigate Ford.
@NancyPelosi @FBI Let's start believing what is told us. Judge Kavanaugh is not guilty, he said so. His voice should be heard just as much as anybody else.
@NancyPelosi @FBI Stand up for what is right! Confirm judge Kavanaugh today! Nancy start listening to your constituents!
@TwoKidsAndAKite @RisingAsch @FoxNews Are you implying that I don't have a job? If it is because I am on twitter right now, don't forget so are you.
@AGBecerra How can the people on a fixed income like the elderly be able to afford the new electric cars? Are you going to have California give them to us? Also what good are electric cars with a limited driving range. Hybrids would be better because you can drive it just like a real car.
@AGBecerra Don't forget the people who fought those fires have said they were bad because the state would not allow the dead trees and undergrowth to be cleared. All those dead trees just added to the fire and made it spread faster and farther. bring back the logging of dead trees.
@PhilipTeresi They are still trying to write the rule book on that. It keeps getting delayed by outside influences that are brought up at the last minute.
@RepJimCosta @VAFresno @DeptVetAffairs It would also be nice if double or triple deck parking with ramps leading right into the hospital.
@CNN Get rid of those reality shows and bring back good shows. By the way, not every show needs to have a gay couple smooching it up on the screen, or even halfway clad females wiggling around. Some good shows with great plot lines would be nice.
@AGBecerra @EPA @NHTSAgov How about proving to the people first? I want to know why you feel it violates federal law.
@TwoKidsAndAKite @RisingAsch @FoxNews Who was that tweet meant for?
@TwoKidsAndAKite @RisingAsch @FoxNews Immigrants, yes, but not illegal aliens.
@TwoKidsAndAKite @RisingAsch @FoxNews I have tried to keep the money from being spent unwisely but the Democrats want to spend the money on the feel-good projects and not on what needs to be fixed. A friend of mine who was visiting from Korea wanted to know why the roads are so bad. depressing to tell him why.
@TwoKidsAndAKite @RisingAsch @FoxNews The homeless that you mention are actually very few, most of the people panhandling are vagrants. They are not looking for housing, they want the money to feed their habits. drugs and drinking are chief among those habits. The opioids are prevalent out here and need controlling.
@TwoKidsAndAKite @RisingAsch @FoxNews No welfare for immigrants for the first 5 years including refugees. The refugees need to have sponsors to come here. No break on tuition for illegal aliens. They must pay the full tuition like the international students. Our tax dollars support schools so the need to pay.
@TwoKidsAndAKite @RisingAsch @FoxNews Another thing that needs to be done is get rid of the anchor babies. Change it so when an illegal alien give birth in the United States the baby is not automatically a US citizen. make it so that at least one parent must be here legally.
@TwoKidsAndAKite @RisingAsch @FoxNews I know what you are talking about and to some degree I agree with you. We need to get people off the welfare rolls and back to work. Everybody yells about more education. They do better early education, but I say get rid of some of the colleges and get more trade schools.
@TwoKidsAndAKite @RisingAsch @FoxNews Nope, the CA tax dollars are being sent the moochers we have in this state. They are spending money on a high-speed rail, instead of fixing the roads. They just raised the gas taxes to give more money to the high-speed rail. Money is also being spent on lawyers for the illegals.
@TwoKidsAndAKite @RisingAsch @FoxNews Unless you live out here it doesn't seem like, but there are a whole lot of people standing on the street corners panhandling. You then see the same people at the welfare office and the food banks. San Francisco is much worse.
@TwoKidsAndAKite @RisingAsch @FoxNews Maybe if California didn't spend all their money on illegal aliens, drugs and feel good bills, high-speed rail to nowhere, we would have more for fixing what needs to be fixed.
@TwoKidsAndAKite @RisingAsch @FoxNews Have you been to San Francisco lately? That is blue as blue can get. They have even had to hire a Poop Squad to go around picking up human feces. Talk about lazy, can't even go far enough to go the bathroom.
@TwoKidsAndAKite @RisingAsch @FoxNews Duh, Social Security is Federal, not State.
@SenKamalaHarris Why you don't care about the rule of law otherwise we would not have as illegal aliens in our country as there are.
@TwoKidsAndAKite @RisingAsch @FoxNews Directly from the Social security website. See the following link or google Social Security refugee payment. https://t.co/6tQlKNa1OZ
@RWPUSA So do women.
@RisingAsch @TwoKidsAndAKite @FoxNews These payments were enacted during the Clinton and Obama terms. https://t.co/6tQlKNa1OZ
@RisingAsch @TwoKidsAndAKite @FoxNews Are you aware that refugees who come over 65 automatically get Social Security without ever paying into the system?
@Public_Citizen @MarchForTruth17 @TheLoyalO @MoveOn @NormEisen @StollmeyerEU @benwikler @AdamParkhomenko @justinhendrix @IndivisibleTeam @Alyssa_Milano Rosenstein will not be fired, he will resign. Are there going to be protests when a person decides to quit? What will you protest about?
@Public_Citizen @MarchForTruth17 @TheLoyalO @MoveOn @NormEisen @StollmeyerEU @benwikler @AdamParkhomenko @justinhendrix @IndivisibleTeam @Alyssa_Milano Don't forget good ol' Hillary. Make sure she is not above the law.
@TwoKidsAndAKite @FoxNews That has changed. D now stands for Socialist, they can't even get the initials correct.
@jennifro @RWPUSA You are the only one keeping yourself down. There are plenty of jobs that pay well. I have never personally seen women treated as property. My mother was never treated as property and we were raised to be respectful to women. It changed at the burning of the bras.
@keemee1999 @RWPUSA I know, it is such a good feeling at times. People reading what I say but they don't understand what I am saying. I did a bunch of what if things but people took it the wrong way especially Painter. All he could think of was sex. Women can also keep their zippers up.
@atipical1 @RWPUSA Most women do not pay, the government takes cares of them. WIC and welfare.
@trumpsuckbigly @RWPUSA What has an apartment got to with anything on this rant?
@SenFeinstein Let's help stop global warming, Dianne, please stop yakking so the earth can cool down.
@charliekirk11 Gold digger.
@TheDemocrats Get out and vote. Vote for the President Trump supporters. We have to tell the Democrats that we will vote to get the American values back and that socialism is not for America!
@seegrayw @RWPUSA Somewhere along the way it did not get through. I agree what he did was completely wrong and if he is guilty then he deserves what he gets. So far it is just accused not tried and convicted.
@speshalteacher @RWPUSA I have known women who have got pregnant just so they could get child support from the fathers. This especially happens near military bases (in the states) because military men can not afford to get in trouble that way. I know 3 women near Ft. Hood, TX who did this. Blackmail.
@susalaesq @RWPUSA Do the payments go to the child? No, they go to the mother. The father does not get a say in where the money is spent. Also, it should be support, not child total care. Have the woman kick in her fair share. If she has to get a job and show proof of income, just like the father.
@jennifro @RWPUSA If he is wearing a clown wig then he probably lives in Wasco, not sure about the poet. All-in-all men get very little say so in the matter even though there are many men who want to be a dad.
@kramer_susan @RWPUSA You are right it is wrong for anybody to give anyone else a drug without their knowledge. I completely forgot about the first part of the article and I agree with you on that. If true, hang em high.
@speshalteacher @RWPUSA What about the women just giving the child to man and then leaving? How can we take more responsibility for our reproductive capabilities when we have no say in the outcome?
@jennifro @RWPUSA I am beginning to enjoy this. What if he wants a child and she doesn't and they had agreed that they would not have one at this time. However through the miracle of life a child is conceived and he wants it but she doesn't, who decides? If the reverse was true, again who decides?
@susalaesq @RWPUSA Just for that, I will not "pipe down." No abortion, no child support.
@speshalteacher @RWPUSA It is always the man's fault. Did she help him achieve the orgasm? If so then it partly her fault too. If she doesn't want an abortion but he does then she should give him no access to the child and do not ask him to pay child support.
@speshalteacher @RWPUSA Then don't make the man pay child support.
@SenSanders The Democratic Senate and Congress were cutting back on the elderly a long time ago. They were instead spending more money on making refugees and illegal aliens comfortable and happy before they would take care of the elderly. No more Social Security payments to the refugees.
@nabsharris @RWPUSA Frankly, his opinion doesn't matter anymore. If she decides on an abortion there is no way for him to stop it. It appears men are no longer or meaning in our society despite all the rage going on against men. The women know this and are making sure we know it too.
@bethm1000 @amyriscool @jackguire2 @RWPUSA How about her taking the pill or the day after pill?
@kramer_susan @RWPUSA I know I didn't mention anything about giving anybody a drug so I am not sure who you meant that for. Abstinence is the best way to not get pregnant but sex was not what I was asking about. I was asking about what to do after the woman gets pregnant.
@amyriscool @RWPUSA Everyone still has missed the question. If a woman gets pregnant shouldn't the guy have a say in the abortion? Many men would like a   child but the women have the control over the life, keep it or murder it.
@amyriscool @jackguire2 @RWPUSA Everyone still has missed the question. If a woman gets pregnant shouldn't the guy have a say in the abortion? Many men would like a   child but the women have the control over the life, keep it or murder it.
@CellularSiren @RWPUSA How many times has it been said: "yes, I'm on the pill' but that is not the case. The woman gets pregnant and the man ends up paying. What if the man says he wants a child and the woman says she is not on the pill but she is. Despite everything, women are in control, not the men.
@RWPUSA Everyone still has missed the question. If a woman gets pregnant shouldn't the guy have a say in the abortion? Many men would like a   child but the women have the control over the life, keep it or murder it.
@Vituperative @jennifro @RWPUSA Everyone still has missed the question. If a woman gets pregnant shouldn't the guy have a say in the abortion? Many men would like a  child but the women have the control over the life, keep it or murder it.
@jennifro @RWPUSA Is it her sperm? The answer is no. Everyone still has missed the question. If a woman gets pregnant shouldn't the guy have a say in the abortion? Many men would like a child but the women have the control over the life, keep it or murder it.
@RWPUSA Women also have the choice of the pill. Do not lay all the blame on the man. Women do have some actions for her pregnancy. The questions still i"does the man have any say so in the matter of the child's life?" Shouldn't an abortion also include the father being informed?
@RWPUSA What if the guy wants a child and the woman doesn't? what if the guy doesn't want a child but the woman does? Who gets to decide this. Why do men have to pay when the woman has control. They were in it together. Shouldn't the guy also have a say so in the life of a child?
@JohnJamesMI On the Apache, were you in the front or rear seat? Personally, I liked the front seat where all the action was. The rear was just the uber driver.
@BretBaier She is using her sex to pull at the heartstrings of the nation. Oh poor me, look what he did to me 36 years ago. I still feel violated because he coped a feel. I wonder how she lives with her husband because of this guy. A George Soros soldier.
@FoxNewsSunday @LindseyGrahamSC I thought you had better sense than that, but I guess I am wrong. She is the one using the people of the United States by not coming forward in a timely matter and using every excuse under the sun to delay the vote. She has her marching orders from George Soros.
@LauraLoomer @KarenMonahan01 It is the media ignoring it, not the people. Keep it up. He will crack one of these days and show his true colors.
@seungminkim @FoxNewsSunday I also watch KBS and NHK and they cannot get the Democrats on their broadcast. What gives? Are they racist?
@PhilipTeresi I haven't had my first cup of coffee yet, who?
@MsBuonarroti24 @gatewaypundit @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @charliekirk11 I don't put much stock in many of the pictures I see on the internet. Photoshop is too common. Groping over the clothes, as I guy I have had that happen to me, and I am sorry to say but I enjoyed it and so did she.
@FoxNews @RepGoodlatte @MariaBartiromo The Senate needs to vote on Judge Kavanaugh on Monday whether she likes it or not. She along with the Democrats are just doing a delaying tactic and we need to say to them, No, we are moving forward.
@FoxNews I always knew Purdue was chicken.
@GregGutfeldShow @greggutfeld @PlanetTyrus @KatTimpf @rcbl @JedediahBila @FoxNews Concerning Taco Bell - Make English the official language of the United States. Also, have voting ballots in English only. To become an American citizen you must pass an English test. American citizens are the only ones allowed to vote in our elections.
@tedlieu What about Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN)? Do you support his accuser with the doctor's report? Are you going to rewrite the standards for him?
@Htygrett1 @tedlieu Did the therapist mention the name of who attacked her? What are witnesses name and did they see it first hand? I have also requested FBI investigations, does that really count? Who are the hundreds of classmates and alumni that support her? I believe Bret Kavanaugh.
@ShannonBream Republican's disregard for the basic due process? What about convicting Judge Kavanaugh before a trial? Is that what the Democrats call due process? what makes it so that she is believed over what he says? Has something changed in the laws that men don't know about?
@WaysMeansCmte When you get a chance look at your 401k. Did it grow? More than likely unless you have a bad manager. What do you think rich people do with their money? Do they buy things? Do they hire people? Do they have parties? All of these things put people to work so they will have money.
@PhilaColumn Finally!
@LowellRoemer @paulsperry_ @TomFitton Oh look, not only does he grope he steal pacifiers.
@paulsperry_ You think they can stop by and pick me up? I need a 5-star hotel with meals, spending money and the expectation of doing nothing but having fun on that trip. If they want to protest, fine, but don't get in the way. I heard there is a nice little alley they can hang out in.
@SenateDems @SenBooker Okay, Cory, we get it, you think only Hispanics built the nation. Now it the time to build the wall on the southern border and around 15-year-olds near Cory Booker.
@SenBooker American Citizens deserve better. BUILD THE WALL, and Cory no more groping 15 years olds.
@Sig45Mike @glennie_sims @mrskolson @TheRealHublife You never know what weapons she may be carrying. Stay safe and get as much info as you can safely. (PS Not everyone is a professional cameraman.)
@TrueloveWill @CNN Is this Hillary with a wig?
@CoryBooker @MikieSherrill Were they 15-year-olds in the picture with you?
@CoryBooker @Malinowski Cory, are you still groping 15-year-olds?
@FoxNews @RudyGiuliani John Kerry is helping and backing them. Watch him closely, he is not a friend of the United States.
@brithume @nypost You hear the Democratic women telling men to shut up &amp; know their place. Can we tell a woman to shut &amp; get in her place? No, we would be shot down in less than a heartbeat. Everyone should have their statements believed. Facts will win out, not allegations. Get on with the vote!
@SenGillibrand @HeidiHeitkamp You are giving her the benefit of the doubt but because he is male he doesn't get that same benefit. Are you still flirting with 17-year-olds? You say you didn't do that, then prove that you didn't.
@Donnam8470Donna @FoxNews I agree, just getting tired of words without any backing, proof or substance. Have a nice day.
@dbongino 2/2 there was also one female porn/prostitute star who tried blackmailing him after she accepted money from him. Granted he was not exactly faithful to his wife at the time but that is between him and her. There was no crime there, just very bad judgment. Rosenstein should go.
@dbongino 1/2 Who is this Schumer character who likes to spout off? All I hear are words without substance. Allegations, rumors, and mischaracterizations but nothing to back them up. There was one tape of what he thought but nothing to prove anything illegal.
@FoxNews I saw the ad but I didn't hear why. There was no substance there. Please explain what he did to make his brothers and sisters mad at him.
@tomselliott I hear the words but I never hear the facts. What has he done that is a danger to every inhabitant of the planet Earth. IS he making deals with aliens to take over the planet or maybe is constructing overlord robots to rule the Earth? Come on man, get it together and retire.
@SebGorka 2a/2 We have tried doing the "Right thing" but all it has gotten us is a kick in the teeth. It is time to show tough love &amp; get the job done. No more nice guys, Crackdown 100% on all illegal aliens and let them know come in the correct way or don't come in at all. OBEY OUR LAWS!
@SebGorka 2/2 The country of origin should not matter anymore. Mexico allowed them through their country and did nothing to stop them. We should reply in kind. Let Mexico escort down to their southern border and let them go back the way they came.
@SebGorka 1/2 Help uphold the rule of law, build the wall. Start with illegal aliens who have broken our laws (big or small) and send them back to where they crossed into the United States. If the crossed into the US at the Mexican border them send them back to Mexico.
@FoxNews @SenJohnHoeven So far the evaluation is: "Does she even know what happened, or is she just making it up to please George Soros?"
@FoxNews Another Maxine Waters moment. I wonder if she is going to try to impeach the Constitution? Democrats just want to destroy our union and make it a socialist society. Ask Berni and that NY woman.
@Tyler2ONeil @realDonaldTrump @SebGorka Bring back the values of the United State of America.
@JudicialWatch I wonder if the State Department and California DMV use the same handbook. Out of date and slow.
@dbongino What do you want to bet she delays it till after the midterm elections and then says: "Oh, I was mistaken saying it was Kavanaugh." Vote now, no more last-minute revelations, no more delays whatsoever.
@FoxNews @MikeEmanuelFox We the people should notify her it is to be Monday or nothing. If not Monday then go home and like the Hawaiian Rep said: "Shut Up."
@SenSanders The sounds like a push for union workers. The job description is up front, you don't have to apply, except maybe Bernie wants you to so he gets his socialist ideas working. The lady complaining in the video really has nothing to complain about.
@SenSanders Loopholes or not, did they break the law? If not what is the problem or that you don't like your job. If you don't like what you get move on. There is nothing stopping you. The people in the US are free to go get another job, there is no law against that.
@minhthuanbui @AlecA82475839 @FoxNews Easy answer, bought from criminals on the street corner. Unfortunately, that happens way too often. It is like buying drugs on the street. There is always someone willing to sell anything for a buck.
@SenSanders Bernie, have you bought your tickets to Venezuela yet?
@SenSanders It may be that many of the companies have seen the writing on the wall and are trying to private or move out of California. The new proposed laws demanding a certain number of women on the boards whether they are qualified or not may hurt some of these companies.
@SenSanders And? This sounds like sour grapes by a Former employee.
@NancyPelosi @HouseGOP Where was your moral outrage for Benghazi?
@minhthuanbui @AlecA82475839 @FoxNews Through Obama fast and furious program.
@minhthuanbui @FoxNews The AR also stands for ArmaLite Rifle, the initials of the manufacturer, not an automatic rifle as many people believe.
@minhthuanbui @FoxNews The shooter in Las Vegas used a bump stock which does not make it an automatic, it just speeds up the semi-auto by using kickback pressure on the shoulder. It does allow the user to get about 400 rounds a minute.
@FoxNews Have the hearing on Monday and if she doesn't like it, tuff. Like Hawaii Rep said, "Shut Up."
@IngrahamAngle I am still trying to find out if they have a union. Are they getting a living wage? If not they need to go on strike.
@minhthuanbui @FoxNews AR-15's are a fancy looking deer rifle and that is all it is. The looks of it have nothing to do with how it performs. There is nothing special about it. It is not an assault rifle and it is not an automatic rifle. It is semi-auto,
@minhthuanbui @FoxNews I was in both places, yes.
@minhthuanbui @FoxNews Danang and Saigon
@minhthuanbui @FoxNews Yes, Vietnam 1971-1972.
@NancyPelosi Don't weigh, don't ask.
@NancyPelosi What about those who are "overweight" are you stand up for their rights? All I ever hear from the government is the overweight people can't do a thing and need to lose their weight. A lot of people have an addiction to food and it is hard to simply stop eating.
@minhthuanbui @FoxNews Vietnam. Stand up and fight for my country. What about you?
@GPKellyS97526 @SenFeinstein Everything, but Moonbeam wants us to go green, so it is just another way to help him out. Do you think they (the CA government) will ever recognize their foolishness?
@gotta_doittoit @SenFeinstein Her net worth could actually be more because of her inside trading with her husband. She gives her husband heads up when she will be voting on bills that would benefit him.
@SenFeinstein Tell you what. Have the state give low income (anybody making less the $85,00 a year) a loan at around 5% interest rate and maybe you will get more people buying these cars. Currently, low income will be paying around 18% or more, if they can get qualified.
@gillibrandny Is Puerto Rico a state yet? I thought they were a separate country.
@minhthuanbui @FoxNews We don't want to take away an item because some people use it the wrong way. Look at cars, should they be taken away because drunks kill a lot of people? Maybe we should take away beer because some people can't handle it.
@minhthuanbui @FoxNews Anything can be a powerful as a gun, dead is dead, no matter which way you look at it. The second amendment that we have is for the protection of the people from a government that wants to enslave it.
@SenWarren I want it in Korean or Japanese. Maybe Tagalog would also be nice. May in Native English would also be great.
@minhthuanbui @FoxNews Guns are not the only thing used to kill. London terrorists have been using knives and vehicle. The middle east has been using rocks to stone people to death. No matter what people will find a way to kill people who they think are their enemy, rightly or not.
@minhthuanbui @FoxNews They already have bulletproof backpacks available.
@EmilyLindin What if that man is your husband, boyfriend, son, brother or any man you can for? Would still be so willing to throw them under the bus? Apparently innocent has no meaning to you. Do you hate men that much? IF so, why? At least let us know why.
@FoxNews It is very sad, but I need more information to make an intelligent comment. Not that all my comments are intelligent, but I try.
@JFNYC1 @SenBooker Do you think Cory Booker is still groping 15-year-olds?
@SenSanders @MadeleineSix Does that mean you are going to move to Canada?
@AsheSchow It has now come to the point if a woman accuses a man of anything he is automatically guilty and will never be innocent, even if the woman recants what she said. Innocent till proven guilty does not exist between man and woman.
@SiddonsDan I want to see this on Live PD or PD Cam.
@SteveSchmidtSES Riddle me this: Why did Dianne wait so long?
@AmyMek @POTUS I think Moonbeam is going to snap, again.
@SenSanders Wrong
@RepJimCosta Wrong
@Salon May have? My question is are you still printing fake news or fake opinions?
@BettyBowers What if it is a democratic male or woman that tries to rape you. Do you give them a pass and apologize because you did not know they were a democrat? What if a Democrat woman tries to screw over a Republican man? Do they get the same belief in what they say?
@TheDemocrats Vote for President Trump supporters and to build the wall. Let's get out there and have our voices heard.
@TheDemocrats We do NOT want everyone! We do NOT want murders, criminals, rapists, and scum. We want to know who you are. Apply the correct way and you may get in. There is no guarantee. If you are wanted you will be jailed and your kids will be taken from you. Blame the parents!
@SenWarren I have a double hernia from an operation performed by the VA and when I ask them about it, they say it is not their fault. I want the FBI to investigate the VA. Since you want to investigate 36-year accusation then you should investigate a 10-year-old problem.
@RepJimCosta @UCMBasicNeeds @ucmerced Why is it when I request a meeting with you I can never get. But around the voting time, you magically appear everywhere. Maybe we need the FBI to investigate this phenomenon.
@CoryBooker I have a double hernia from an operation performed by the VA and when I ask them about it, they say it is not their fault. I want the FBI to investigate the VA. Since you want to investigate 36-year accusation then you should investigate a 10-year-old problem. Let me know.
@CoryBooker It seems like anybody can now request an FBI investigation. Can we have 2 more investigations? First one on Maxine Waters and her threats to President Trump Supporters and threats to President Trump. The second investigation ought to be on Cory Booker who thinks he is Spartacus.
@jujo28 @CNN What about Juanita Broaddrick. Why shouldn't she have been believed or is because he was a democrat?
@CNN Right the right thing to do is ignore the accuser and get on with the business of running the country.
@FoxNews A demand from her lawyer, from Feinstein, from the Democratic Party, From Hillary from Obama and finally from George Soros.
@LincolnFresno Sheesh, I want to FBI to investigate a lot of things but that ain't gonna happen either.
@TheDemocrats @AlexPadilla4CA Yes, protect the vote. Demand ID and verification of citizenship! California does not even check if you are a citizen when you register to vote. One other way is to vote for those supporting our President.
@SenSanders The only problem I have had with McDonald workers is that they don't get my order correct. I did have one young woman get mad at me and said I was disrespecting her when she could not understand I said no cheese. She was the one who disrespected me. If they walk out, fire them.
@chuckwoolery He not only said America does it, but he also singled out the military for doing it. He needs to leave this country and go live in Venezuela and don't bother to come back.
@SenFeinstein I am trying to figure it out. Is it true that women never lie? If so then why weren't they believed when they told their story about Bill Clinton? Maybe it is just left wing women don't lie? Do you think that is true, Dianne?
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump It doesn't matter what President Trump does you will not like it. Don't forget your "Spartacus" guy was releasing classified material and we didn't hear you complaining about that. It is time for you to sit down, shut up and vote. I want to see a yes vote.
@SJoyce65059389 I am glad my granddaughters don't see that ice cream. I would have a hard time trying to find it around here.
@SenSanders Stop giving refugees SSI, they didn't pay into the system so they should get any. If you want to give them money, give them money from your pocket, not mine.
@TheDemocrats @justinhartley Yes, Vote, for those who back President Trump. Make America Great Again. Get Bernie Sanders out of here. Send him and his friends to Venezuela!
@seanhannity Bernie calling you an idiot is too polite of a term for you. Go to Venezuela and never come back!
@ElizabethHeng Don't forget about the Merced area. I did hear the ad about you not voting on certain items for the valley. The ad did say you were not here. Do they really expect you to vote on valley problems when you are living outside the area. If you're registered elsewhere you vote there.
@RepJimCosta That is BS. You have done anything except hang out down on the border saying how bad we are on the Illegal Aliens. The only time you seem to make to the valley is when you need to be reelected. We have asked to make your schedule available for viewing but that is never done.
@ucmerced @NatureEnergyJnl Always do extreme testing on new products. What will cause them to fail? Heat, dirt, dust, vibrations, humidity, and other environmental problems need to be looked at. That is just a few items. A new product needs to be "slammed" to make sure it will perform as promised.
@DonaldJTrumpJr How many Islamic states are there? 57
@MikeHeron8 But which Native American language?
@RealJamesWoods I have never seen anything come up about California launching its own probe. Trying to spend money we don't have. Maybe it will the high-speed spaceship to the stars along with his high-speed rail. Yay, Moonbeam, you are really high again.
@RobertAOeser @statedeptspox Blame it on the parents for not wanting to obey our laws and also putting their children at risk. Verify the children are theirs then send them back telling don’t try to come back, even legally. You cannot be trusted therefore we don’t want you.
@FoxNews Qualifications - Able to extended her middle finger on her left hand while riding a bicycle and not crash. Great accomplishment.
@RealCandaceO I believe some of the major carriers of this disease are Maxine Waters,, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and most of the Democrats. The worst carrier is Hillary Clinton. Her victimhood disease has seemed to reach newer highs every day. Is there any cure or inoculation?
@GrayForAssembly AB3259 - Vote no except for the part of changing 19__ to 20__. Duh, common sense. the 1900's are done and gone we are now in the 2000's. Get with the times.
@GrayForAssembly AB3260 - Vote yes with amendments - Post the notices on the website, bulletin boards and the local Newspaper where the offender is located/sells. The notices should also be on the local city/county website where the offender lives/sells.
@GrayForAssembly AB3261 - We need a way to rate potency. The level of potency sold should be lower. There also needs to be an accurate way to determine if someone is "high" for the purposes of public safety (driving). Lower the taxes to underprice the illegal trade. Keep $ in CA.
@GrayForAssembly AB3263 - vote yes with amendments - change 20 miles to 60 miles.
@GrayForAssembly AB3264 - Vote Yes. Cut back on instituting more taxes
@GrayForAssembly AB127 - vote no. Tired of seeing a "special" group getting extra attention. They should be treated just like any other citizen.  The only group of people discriminated against even by the State and US government are the people who are obese.
@GrayForAssembly AB18 - vote no. We still need the orientation program to make sure the doctors know our rules and regulation. I would also suggest that all courses be done in English. Make speaking, reading and writing in English a requirement.
@GrayForAssembly AB17 - vote No. No free passes, Half price for 5 and under. 3/4 price from 6 to 17. 18 and over should pay full fare. Income doesn't matter. Give up smoking, drinking, and drug if necessary.
@GrayForAssembly AB11 - Vote no. The age should be under 18, not 21. It actually should be done for all. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
@GrayForAssembly AB10 - Vote No. Isn't about time that the parents pay for necessary products. If they have to quit drinking, smoking, and drugs so be it. Bring back personal responsibility.
@GrayForAssembly AB8 - vote Yes
@GrayForAssembly AB7 - Vote no, unless the crime would only be a misdemeanor with no fines or punishment, just a ticket asking you to PLEASE not carry the weapon.
@SenGillibrand It is time to make English the Official language of the United States.  Language is the common denominator of cultures. Americans should be able to communicate with each other. We should be able to go anywhere in the  US and be understood without a translator.
@GrayForAssembly AB6 - Vote Yes.
@GrayForAssembly AB3 - Vote No. We considered adults at the age of 18, so everything should be legal at that age including drinking, firearms, smoking and other age-restricted items. At 18 you can die for your country but should also be allowed to live in your country.
@GrayForAssembly Assembly Bill No. 4 - Vote Yes
@RepJimCosta   It is time to make English the Official language of the United States.  Language is the common denominator of cultures. Americans should be able to communicate with each other. We should be able to go anywhere in the  US and be understood without a translator.

@Jay30409668 @FoxNews The reason this thread was started was that an employee at a Taco Bell would not take an order because the customer would not speak Spanish. English is the common language in the US. There are many countries that want their people to learn English to compete in the Global market.
@Jay30409668 @FoxNews I myself speak Korean at home but I do not force anyone to speak it. I do however expect that when I go to a restaurant the workers understand me and we are able to communicate. The United States was founded by English speakers. Look at the Declaration of Independence.
@Jay30409668 @FoxNews Nope, you missed the point. We need a common language that everyone speaks. It is fine to speak another language but when go to a store and want to buy something a common language is needed.
@THEHermanCain It is time to make English the Official language of the United States.  Language is the common denominator of cultures. Americans should be able to communicate with each other. We should be able to go anywhere in the  US and be understood without a translator.

@JimmyTheMoose1 @FoxNews Herein lies the problem, I would retweet items like that. We need to discuss things and be able to back up what we say. I will try to find out where I saw them but was less than 24 hours ago.

@FoxNews It appears that the left is having a lot of problems. If weren't for foul language and disgusting pictures they would not have a thing to say. Disgusting language, threats of violence and filthy pictures are their forms of communications now.
@Grey_Obelisk @SRuhle @TuckerCarlson @MichaelAvenatti @realDonaldTrump @StormyDaniels Why didn't you hold Bill Clinton to at least the same standards? President Trump at least did the deed before he was President and definitely not in the Oval Office.

@C_Dawg_Knight @FoxNews もう一度言ってくれ
@FoxNews It is definitely time to make English the official language of the United States.
@FoxNews If you look closely he is not putting his arms around either one, in fact, he is standing a respectful distance from the closest lady. That is the way you gain respect, by showing respect.
@ElizabethHeng Love the attack ads by Jimmie Costa. If you live in another state then you are probably registered to vote in that state. Quit trying Jimmie you are just making a fool of yourself. PS - There is no law requiring a person to vote.
@RepJimCosta @NatResources @YosemiteNPS @NatlParkService Isn't it funny that there is a group here in America that wants the US Park Rangers to change their uniforms because they look too much like the Borger Guard uniforms. Three guesses which group that is.
@Sadwings51 @SenGillibrand Only nonsense because you don't want to accept the truths of what is happening to our Social Security. Have a nice day.
@msdeehj1 @anaiswoolf1 @SenSchumer But why did he need translate it? They could have done it themselves.
@Sadwings51 @SenGillibrand It still goes to the fact did not put into the system or work their 40 hours.
@anaiswoolf1 @SenSchumer By the way, English is also spoken in Puerto Rico.
@anaiswoolf1 @SenSchumer Degree in Telecommunications, I have been to school in Canada, Japan, Korea, and the United States so been there done that. Nowhere in Schumer's spiel did he say it was just for Puerto Ricans so why should he put it out in every language spoken in this country?
@BobDingles123 @anaiswoolf1 @SenSchumer But he didn't put Russian translation on Twitter.
@PeterCJD @ElizabethHeng @realDonaldTrump Maybe CNN and MSNBC should stand down also.
@anaiswoolf1 @SenSchumer You call yourself an educator, get out and educate yourself on who can become a US citizen. That has to be on of the dumbest statements I have seen on twitter. There are many Korean who have become US Citizens, my wife for one.
@SenSchumer Why is it I never hear or see anything in Korean from you?
@Sadwings51 @SenGillibrand Oh yeah, it is a federal thing, not a local thing.
@Sadwings51 @SenGillibrand I have checked in my area with the Social Security ar3ea supervisor and certain refugees get an automatic SSI without any time and never paid into the system. Please check again with your area and ask them about refugees getting SSI.
@ElizabethHeng Don't forget about Benghazi.
@Sadwings51 @SenGillibrand First One:	  https://t.co/6tQlKNa1OZ	  	First page top of the second row. Concerning 7 year limit. That is for refugees. No 40-hour requirement. Did not have to pay into the system and that is SSI.
@SenSanders How much do you pay the people who work for you? A little transparency, please.
@SenSanders California Gov Brown's new green clean ambulances will start production 2019. https://t.co/zAXM6WPsn8

@Sadwings51 @SenGillibrand Getting the info for you.
@chuckwoolery Blame it on the law breaking illegal alien parents. If they weren’t doing illegal activities the children would still be with them. Obey the law.
@SenGillibrand The average monthly Social Security benefit check is $1,294, so why do refugees get up $1850 a month. They should only get the average at most. It should also be noted that they don't have to pay it back and they have put into the system. This is one reason we are going broke.
@SenGillibrand When are you going to give a substantial increase to people on Social Security? When are you going to stop foreign nationals from getting Social Security who have never paid into the system? Look at the refugees who get anywhere from 5 to 8 years of Social Security.
@WashTimes Mueller, have you looked at this foreign collusion with the Democratic Party? Should he be indicted on collusion charges?
@chuckwoolery Indian, why not American? Indian running again a fake American Indian. If you put that in there it would have been better. The two Indian are vastly different, but it is a good play on words.
@nbcwashington That is just a distraction. Imagine what his brothers are doing while the people evacuate the building.
@syptweet What if the person you hear is not speaking English, can we consider that hate speech, because we have no idea what they are saying?
@FoxNews It is not a law so that is Ford's prerogative. I would like to see all cars sold in America be made in America, but that will probably never happen again. We do however need to know that those cars are built solidly and will hold up for us. I wish we could get to manufacturing.
@SenSanders Get of RBG, she is a threat to the environment. Her rulings are against all of humankind. How does that sound? No judge alone is going to bring down a thing. It takes 5 judges. To put one as swing vote is ludicrous. Anyone of them can be a swing vote. Abide by the constitution
@RepJoeKennedy Yes, get out and vote for the right way, for the Trump supported candidates and not for socialism. Socialism will just take away your earning and eventually your freedoms. It has happened many times. Look at Venezuela.
@SenGillibrand We need to tell CPS to stand down and let the parents discipline their children. Some kids only behave when disciplined others will do it on their own. We don't need CPS threating the parents for discipline, beratings yes, discipline, No.
@SenGillibrand You have that wrong, when does money make students learn, never. The parents need to get more involved. We need to open the classrooms so the parents can go in at any time and see what their precious baby is learning and doing. It may open the eyes of some of the parents.
@politvidchannel Another round of tax cuts, that wou.ld be great. I believe it every citizen's God-given responsibility to give the least amount in taxes as they can. We need to force the government into doing more while spending less. Get rid of the pork in the projects and get real things done.
@KamalaHarris What about Bhuddas birthday? I have never seen you mention anything about him.
@bestcakerecipes @RoySchuhmacher @RealJamesWoods Get rid of CPS so the children can be disciplined again.
@VALLY21504730 As it should be.
@RealCandaceO Was it Naomi Osaka or Stormi Daniels refusing to disavow the KKK. LOL
@SueinRockville @TheDemocrats @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @clairecmc @SenatorHeitkamp @JoeManchinWV @SenDonnelly @JeffFlake @SenBobCorker I do call my representatives and even been told that they don't want to hear what I have to say on some of the subjects. I have never said a bad word just tell them what I feel about some things and when they reply with some of their sayings I have answers for them.
@TheDemocrats Is it because Judge Kavanaugh is white? How is he a threat to voting rights? The only threat I see to voting rights are the people who vote and are not allowed to. Oh yes, what about those who can vote but choose not to?
@RealCandaceO You hear it all the time; "I'm here fighting for (fill in the blank)." What they are really there for is a paycheck or in some cases a hefty donation to their personal non-profit fund. Like illegal aliens, (my pet peeve) if you obey the rules then you would not be in trouble.
@AMike4761 That picture is from Tirana's main boulevard in Albania, not Alabama.
@thehill DNC are you just trying to generate interest? Maybe dead? Have you tried to confirm about the death? What are your sources? Is it an anonymous source? Come on let us know. We can handle the truth but you have to come clean. We are tired of lies, deceit, and misleading comments.
@FoxNews Maybe the sales were for flip-flops only.
@FoxNews Oh my, another cultural appropriation scream. "Take a knee" I have heard that in church, in football practice, in the military, and in marriage proposals, but I have never heard it was for only one race. Maybe they meant sexist; the woman should be proposing to the man.
@foxandfriends Make English the Offical language in the schools. Many won’t like that but we need a common language. We might as make it the one that was named after me. As far as I know, nobody spoke it until I was born.
@foxandfriends It is time to rename the State Board of Education to the State Board of Indoctrination. We really need to get the school back to teaching and not indoctrination. Parents need to look at what the children are being taught and hold the school responsible for what they teach.
@CNN Are absolutely sure that wasn't a California Kindergarten?
@AMike4761 I would add that say more Illegal Aliens, As long as the immigrants coming in are invited that can be controlled. Open boards and illegal aliens just flooding into any country is unwise. Who are they? Why are they here? What are their intentions? All countries need to know!
@SenSchumer I listened to you and along with Booker you are a joke. If Kavanaugh had pledged anything to you other than upholding the Constitution I would have been very upset with him. You demanding he pledge to you is absurd. Y0ou talked about President Trump wanting loyalty, glass house.
@CoryBooker The Senate ethics committee is just a joke now thanks to Booker. He has proven that Senators don't give a damn about ethics, they just want power and be able to line their own pockets. He needs to out of there and someone with true ethics needs to be brought in. Dem or Rep.
@LindseyGrahamSC @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump I hate to say it but the Obama years were not the good ole years. I remember the Reagan &amp; Kennedy years being much better. I remember when Americans were respected. Clinton changed that with his romp and became the laughing stock of the world. I saw that first hand overseas.
@chuckwoolery Just wait for it. Illegal aliens will soon be taking jobs away from American citizens and they will just love her for it. Hopefully, she will keep the voting ability sacred.
@CoryBooker You should not have released them. You should be put behind bars for it. Other than that there is nothing inflammatory about the releases, considering the dates the messages were written. They were mostly right after 9/11. The others were about equality.
@BenJealous @realDonaldTrump Maybe we should go back to those times including no electricity, growing our own food and defending each home with a musket. Sorry to tell you but times have changed and not everyone coming here is coming to work.
@mchooyah Thanks.
@HillaryClinton Biggest wildfire caused by not clearing away the dead trees and underbrush. Ask the firefighters who fought it.
@SenSanders So Bernie, How is your stock portfolio doing?
@CoryBooker Don't they sell over the counter birth control? What about condoms? Personal responsibility or has that been thrown out the window? Doesn't planned parenthood give you free birth control? Of course, there are always exceptions to the rule and let the doctors handle that.
@SenKamalaHarris vague is better than none. Look at your own glass house before you start throwing stones. What kind of answers are you giving your constituents? When are you going to start working for American citizens and not the illegal aliens? You spend too much time on them.
@BrandonGaines91 @SenKamalaHarris I know, but the courts don't.
@BillOReilly @PhilMushnick @newyorkpost The only problem with that is we are putting American value system on other countries. It doesn't work. What we consider next to nothing may be a middle income in that country. There are countries where it is the opposite. Need to look at buying power, not the amount of money.
@BrandonGaines91 @SenKamalaHarris I wanted another child and she didn't. Now divorced.
@SenFeinstein Still waiting to hear about the insider trading from Dianne's husband.
@BrandonGaines91 @SenKamalaHarris You have missed the real question which was why if the man doesn't want the child but the woman does, why does he have to pay? This is going one of those things which really has no good answer because someone is not going to like it.
@WichitaStatePD @LawrenceKS_PD A politician in the normal habitat. Practicing for the crowds.
@The_Unlocked @SenKamalaHarris Not yet, just wait.
@BrandonGaines91 @SenKamalaHarris It is the man's sperm so shouldn't he also have a say so?
@gorkaotz @TimothyKenison @FoxNews @ElizabethHeng That 0% tariff was for cars only, and President Trump rejected because he is trying to get ALL tariffs down to 0%. As reported in various "news" outlets.
@FoxNews @ElizabethHeng Everybody complains about farmers - Are you Hangry? Everybody complains about big corporations - How is your 401k doing? Everybody complains about low wage jobs - Are you studying? Everybody complains about socialism - Do you want to give your money away for someone to lay about.
@SenKamalaHarris Why is it a man no say so for the child? What is the man wants a child and the woman doesn't? She gets to decide to have an abortion whether he likes it or not. If the man doesn't want the child and the woman does, then the man ends up paying for the rest of his life. Fairness.
@45th_FLOTUS I am trying to get my stepsons and granddaughters here legally but they are on a 12-year waiting list. I wish there were a way to speed it up but so far no luck.
@SenSanders If people would obey the laws then we would not have so many people in jail. Other countries do not have the same laws we do and you can see how most of them are.
@SenKamalaHarris @maddow That is the best way to talk to Maddow, so one see you talking to her.
@SenGillibrand See you later.
@chuckwoolery The ok sign.
@SenSchumer Time to get your facts straight. DACA expired not rescinded. It should have never been put in place, to begin with. They are illegal aliens in our country. They should go back to their own country and then try to come back the correct way.
@SenKamalaHarris Now you know how it feels when you are ignored. Do you now have an idea how we feel when you ignore us, especially the American citizens that try to contact you? Work for Americans, not illegal aliens.
@RepJimCosta What about the water storage problems? When are you going to put Americans first?
@SenSanders Find another job, or like many others start working two jobs.
@timpo55 @TrumpsReturns @DineshDSouza Yeah, I do feel like that dog at times. Have a nice day.
@RepJoeKennedy You should look at the whole video to see what happened. The father came up to him from behind while the judge was going the other way. There was no chance for him to see a bracelet or anything about him. That picture shows a glance which lasted about a second.
@LincolnFresno Totally unbelievable. You can no longer do something or say anything without it being racist, upsetting or politically incorrect. Time to bring the country back and make it great again.
@SenKamalaHarris Who or what do you hold your loyalty to? While you complain please let us know so we can determine whether you are worthy of your position. I hope you can do a better job than you did as you did when naming ballot initiatives.
@KamalaHarris We have to appoint him to see who he is.
@SenJeffMerkley You complain when you don't get the documents, then you complain when you get the documents. Sheesh! You are never satisfied.
@SenKamalaHarris So what, do it. You got what you wanted. Stop complaining and do your job.
@SenatorLeahy Just think how the American public felt when you all said that you must pass it to see what is in it.
@CNN I hope it gets built then taken back.
@JohnHolbein1 @nberpubs It is just another government job they want to be filled so they can get more of your money.
@Ahmadinejad1956 @Kaepernick7 In case you did not know Kaepernick quit the 49's to go, free agent. That does not guarantee him a job anywhere. It is up to teams whether they want him or not. His own actions have led to those consequences. I would not want anyone on my team with his attitude.
@kausmickey Pay the workers what they are worth. If they worth the $15 then pay them that much. If they are worth only $7 then that is what they should get. Their worth should be determined by experience and performance. Time on the job should be the last thing to count.
@sclancy79 @NFL @Nike Buy SAS shoes, they're better quality and fit better and they are made in America (Texas).
@SenBooker How about implications: Are still sleeping with 13-year-olds? Implications have no real meanings without facts. Also, what was he implicated in?
@Richardhiatt16 @DeptofDefense @IIIMEF No more than FLR-9's after Penthouse.
@DeptofDefense @IIIMEF I wish I had that system, but all we during my time was cable and a Tropospheric Scatter system.
@w_terrence The real problem is that Hillary never looked that good.
@LeahRBoss That ad says "Pity me, I feel threatened by my own actions. I quit a team and now nobody will hire me. Pity me." Sorry Nike but I will buy anything from you again. I don’t even want to see your logo anymore. “Just do it” sounds like an anarchist mantra.
@FoxNews That was not the people of CA that was the Democrat overlords in Sacramento CA. We tell them but they do not listen to the people themselves just their money donors.
@dbongino Nike is not doing themselves any favors with those socks. As for Kaepernick, everybody forgets he put himself on the open market as a free agent and that does not mean he will get picked up by anybody. Those are the results of his actions, not collusion.
@alpinegoodtime @lori_rencher @TheDemocrats Break time. I have to get my granddaughters ready for their flight back to South Korea. Have a happy Labor Day.
@dbongino I wonder if she told them to gather in groups and wear brown shirts?
@CNN I wish I could have read Mollie's mind but I never even met her. Her smile is the most I remember about her pictures. It seems like she was smiling in every picture I saw. I am sure she would rather still be here if she could and let us know what she really thinks. My condolences
@alpinegoodtime @lori_rencher @TheDemocrats He has too many holding and property to for extortion. The main problems I hear on the news are suppositions and ifs. I try to look at facts and that is really hard to find and verify, but I keep trying.
@alpinegoodtime @lori_rencher @TheDemocrats I would never call Jimmy Carter JC, but I am not sure it was Jimmy that got himself into debt. It could have been his brother with that beer venture. As far as President Trump being in debt, I kind of doubt otherwise he would be collecting his salary instead of donating it back.
@lori_rencher @alpinegoodtime @TheDemocrats What skeletons? The only thing I have really heard is a tape of 2 guys talking rudely about women. Not right, but not a crime.
@Susie16540504 Why?
@CNN A massive tragedy for the world.
@alpinegoodtime @TheDemocrats Ok, now I got it. Let them lie in the bed they make. I agree with that part of it. I cannot defend the actions of President Trump before he even started to run for office. He was a private citizen at that time. Once you are in the office all that changes.
@alpinegoodtime @TheDemocrats https://t.co/5Vr9GdxIJy
@alpinegoodtime @TheDemocrats Are you kidding, who gave Putin that great uranium deal? It wasn't President Trump. Who told the president of Russia he would have an easier time working with Putin after the elections?
@GavinNewsom Wrong the right to work is the backbone of our economy.
@SenGillibrand Workers need to prosper so let them work without having to join a union. Let them be paid for the experience and performance.
@SenateDems Let's strengthen workers freedom by allowing to work where they want without having to join a union. Workers should be paid on their experience and performance on the job. Not by just longevity of hanging around.
@FoxNews @guypbenson Voting is definitely issued based unless you are just a sheep and do as you are told. We need more people to vote on the issues and not because they are one party or another. My biggest issue is ILLEGAL ALIENS, not immigration. There is a big difference. Obey the laws.
@TomMorrisJr1 Celebrating Labor Day with my son and granddaughters today. They are returning to South Korea tomorrow. They have enjoyed the visit here and they really enjoyed America.
@danielledsouzag @Pontifex The pope needs to tear down the Vatican walls and take all the gold and jewels and start doing something good with it. Water and hospitals in the area of need would be a good starting place. Time to live up to what you preach.
@FoxNews No flag, no movie. The theaters need to voice the opinions of their customers in the movie industry. Not everybody is a Candian or a Democrat.
@KialoHQ First a viable space station, then the moon, the asteroid belt and then to Mars. We need to go in steps. The station to build. Moon to refine. The asteroid belt for raw material. Mars because it is there. Curiosity and the spirit of adventure. Push forward.
@NancyPelosi Sorry, Nancy but that is not true. The union is only about 11% of the workforce and a great majority of that is the public, not the private sector. Teachers are also a great majority of the public sector. They should be able to at public schools without having to join the union.
@alpinegoodtime @TheDemocrats Hillary schmoozing it up.
@realDonaldTrump Unions take money from the people who are working so they line their own pockets. Give the workers the right to work without having them join a union! Labor day needs to be for the workers who actually do the work and not the union bosses who want the power over the workers.
@alpinegoodtime @TheDemocrats Don't forget about the antics of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Glass houses.
@RealCandaceO I don't know about the adult part but they older than the average child throwing a temper tantrum. The truth is sometimes hard to swallow but it needs to get out there.
@TheDemocrats We need more right to work states.
@DameJEMarshall @KamalaHarris @BrunoAmato_1 @FBI @GOPLeader @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @GOP @GOPChairwoman Who gave the Russians a great deal on uranium? Who got paid to speak from the Russian government?
@TweetlySaved @TheDemocrats I have been to the voting offices here and called the CA number for voters and no go. I have tried to get my assemblyman involved but I am not a big enough donor for him to get involved. I am taking a look at that minority voting rights you sent and see what that says. Thanks.
@TweetlySaved @TheDemocrats Have you actually seen the ballot? They don't have them in this area and I am in CA. I have been at them for over 15 years and they will NOT give her a ballot in Korean. I even have a hard time getting the ballot information in Korean.
@foxandfriends Now we can have the wall built from the money we are not sending to Pakistan. Now if only we could take the money we are sending to Mexico, El Salvador, Venezuela and the other countries that the illegal aliens come and put that money toward the wall.
@crickafer00 @realDonaldTrump No flag, no movie.
@FoxNews @POTUS I wonder about these polls. Nobody has ever asked me what I think, they just try to tell me what I think.
@TheDemocrats Make English the official language of the United States.
@TheDemocrats Why do we have voting in Spanish? My wife cannot get a ballot in Korean. Why does she have to learn English but the hispanics don't? In order to vote you must be an American citizen and in order to be an American citizen, you must pass an English test. English only for voting.
@TheDemocrats Yes, get out and vote for the right way, for the Trump supported candidates and not for socialism. Socialism will just take away your earning and eventually your freedoms. It has happened many times. Look at Venezuela.
@FauxLassy @DiamondandSilk What is even worse, try to find a doctor at the VA who is a native English speaker.
@alpinegoodtime @TheDemocrats A fabricated dossier and what is in the National Enquirer's safe?
@RealJamesWoods I would be grateful and honored that Kaepernick would go away and be quiet so I can watch football again without hearing about him.
@FoxNews We at least know he is not a snowflake. He is willing to work to make his way in life and he should be commended. It is always nice that people notice the people who bag their groceries, normally they go unnoticed and very seldom does anyone say "Thank You" to them.
@TheDemocrats The new socialist democratic is ripping off their donating public by not telling them the truth with what they will do with their money. Buying dossiers on their opponents should not be paid for by their donations.
@charliekirk11 Agreed, Logan Act. He no longer represents the United States and should be reporting all contacts he has with any foreign government trying to gain favors from him.
@foxandfriends It is not going the way Chuckie baby wants so he is going to throw a temper tantrum.
@johngizzi @MeghanMcCain @realDonaldTrump President Trump was not invited and people complained because he was golfing. What is he supposed to do? Sit around and mope? No, relax and take it in stride. Take the holiday off and then get back to work on Tuesday.
@foxandfriends If they don't want to talk we can't make them. Let the lay in the bed they made. We need fair and equitable trade with every country.
@MarkYoungTruth @realDonaldTrump I was at Columbia State Park in CA yesterday and noticed a woman trying to get her kids to listen to her while they climbed a rock. It was like her talking to a rock. That is the same way I feel while talking to Democrats.
@DiamondandSilk I have a double hernia from an operation done by the VA and I can't get a thing. Feinstein taking care of her own.
@YourStuffIsBad @JudicialWatch Is that a Nazi salute Maxine is giving?
@DianaAlford20 @PhilipTeresi Only if it is Antifa attire.
@SenGillibrand Trying to make NY the stoner state.
@TRats91 @MarkYoungTruth Father was on official orders so he is an American Citizen. I had the same for my son who was born in Japan. He was born on a military base and I was on official order, so he is an American citizen.
@rolandscahill Are we sure it is candy?
@foxandfriends I say make the first 5 miles inside the border a free fire training zone.
@RepGosar Build the wall. Enforce the laws. It doesn't matter whether they did anything else, they are here illegally. Send them back. We need to know who they are, that is the reason they need to come in legally.
@RealCandaceO It appears it is not ok to use funerals as political stances except in the case of President Trump, then it is anything goes.
@nasty_woman2 @SenSchumer To me, it seems like they are on vacation all the time.
@RealJamesWoods If your theater is showing the movie then tell them No Flag, No movie.
@drcarlpatrasso @RealJamesWoods There's a movie?
@AmberJPhillips Did you catch Bill starting to lean over for a look?
@CNN How many cases were brought in from other countries?
@BasedBrooklynNY @stephendare @tabithagoodwin @EatMoreBacon_ @mattgaetz @realDonaldTrump Are you trying to give the Mafia a bad name?
@ClintOlivier Not everything is inevitable. If that were the case I would get my weight down to 185. We all know that ain't gonna happen in my lifetime.
@constancehammon They did because they were caught.
@DineshDSouza What in the world, in this case, the moon, does being a hero have to do with planting a flag? Nothing! Many men and women have planted a flag in places to represent their country or even to claim it for their country. Get the scene in the movie.
@RepJimCosta @uscensusbureau @PBS @NewsHour Count the illegals for the population but not for representation.
@LincolnFresno Don't forget the AB10. No more money bail.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump @ActMeasuresDoc Where is the proof? Just because you say it doesn't make it so.
@GrumpAdam @GavinNewsom @realDonaldTrump That is what I am saying reunite them and get them out of here.
@RepAdamSchiff Help clean it out - leave.
@GavinNewsom @realDonaldTrump Blame it on the parents for not wanting to obey our laws and also putting their children at risk. Verify the children are theirs then send them back telling don’t try to come back, even legally. You cannot be trusted therefore we don’t want you.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Because of the Democrats wanting a $15 minimum wage the buying power of the dollar is shrinking. I think we ought to take the minimum wage to 5.75 an hour and if they do their job well then increase their wage. The minimum wage is not supposed to be a "living wage." It is a start
@HouseDemocrats @RepBeatty Make English the official language of the United States of America. My wife went to a Chinese buffet the other day and she came back to the table complaining the worker doing the Mongolian cooking does not speak English. My wife is Korean.
@HouseDemocrats @RepBeatty Work for the American people and not the illegal aliens.
@RepAdams @realDonaldTrump Work for the American people and not the illegal aliens.
@RepAdams @realDonaldTrump Make English the official language of the United States of America. My wife went to a Chinese buffet the other day and she came back to the table complaining the worker doing the Mongolian cooking does not speak English. My wife is Korean.
@RepAdams @realDonaldTrump The 1% also hire the most people and spend their money putting others to work. They have a lot of forms that need to file and the Federal workers handle that giving them a job so they can get paid. The average American person is tired of paying too much in taxes.
@RepMGriffith Work for the American people and not the illegal aliens.
@RepMGriffith Make English the official language of the United States of America. My wife went to a Chinese buffet the other day and she came back to the table complaining the worker doing the Mongolian cooking does not speak English. My wife is Korean.
@TrumpsReturns @DineshDSouza Who would check facts on a fantasy? Now you are free to roam.
@DineshDSouza New movement: Make English the official language of the United States of America. My wife went to a Chinese buffet the other day and she came back to the table complaining the worker doing the Mongolian cooking does not speak English. My wife is Korean.
@GrizwoldW @CNN You are correct. I missed a zero. 1% is $4,000. Thanks for letting me know. I try to be accurate, but sometimes mistakes happen.
@JudgeJeanine @foxandfriends New movement: Make English the official language of the United States of America. My wife went to a Chinese buffet the other day and she came back to the table complaining the worker doing the Mongolian cooking does not speak English. My wife is Korean.
@RealJamesWoods What is wrong with this state: Democrats.
@CNN If true, keep 1% and the other 99% to the person it was a raised for. The 1% is for doing the work to get it set up and other misc things. 1%, in this case, is $400.
@JudicialWatch That need to be done with every state especially CA. CA also needs to have a voter ID. Racist, hah, the Dems just want to bolster their rolls.
@benshapiro Political correctness appropriated another word so we can't use it like it has been used for a very long time. Monkey with = mess with.
@LizWFB Stupid is as stupid does.
@jonkarl I wonder about these polls. Nobody has ever asked me what I think, they just try to tell me what I think.
@CNN Learn it. Rules are rules. Just because you are a mother or father it does not ENTITLE you to break them.
@DeanObeidallah It doesn't matter why he fired him, he needed to go. This happens everywhere all the time. When a person no longer is needed or has become a liability to the organization any excuse is a good excuse to fire them. From what Comey himself said it was to go.
@AMike4761 The Catholic church is no longer a God fearing organization. It needs to get back to its roots and stop changing everything for political correctness.
@SenGillibrand Call them to make sure that they keep the criminals in jail and send the rest back ASAP. The longer they are here the more they cost us. If you want to come here do it legally!
@GavinNewsom What about when they gave the Social Security people a 2% pay raise then raised the cost of Medicaid?  At that same time, they gave a 5% percent mandatory minimum wage increase to HB2 visa holders. Their minimum wage is now over $14 per hour. That was done under the Dems.
@GavinNewsom This has an easy answer; quit spending so much on projects we don't need or even want. The people sometimes have to do with less and it is about time the government learns to do without for their pet projects.
@SenSanders What about the American subsidizing you. You are on the government dole. You should be preaching for free or at least near that. Spread your wealth around, but I want to keep what I have!
@HillaryClinton Blame the parents. They don't want to obey our laws and try to sneak into the country. Remember this separation actions started with your husband so get over it and tell them to obey the laws.
@seanhannity I live in CA and I do not want to subsidize anyone's rent. I worked two jobs when necessary, they can too. Learn personal responsibility.
@TheDemocrats @AndrewGillum Another Fake News story. The democrats want racism and will make anything sound like racism so they can think they are relevant.
@PJMedia_com Do that include the guys also?
@TheDemocrats @cdockjr Yes, get out and vote for the right way, for the Trump supported candidates and not for socialism. Socialism will just take away your earning and eventually your freedoms. It has happened many times. Look at Venezuela.
@espn Why would I want another leftist political show when all I wanted was sports?
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Not needed - revoke them!
@CNN Are they called love birds?
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Isn't Puerto Rico a sovereign nation. Just because Americans live there we cannot just go in and do what we want. What would you want the administration do if it happened to Russia? There are American citizens living there also. Blame it on the government there, not here.
@GavinNewsom @realDonaldTrump Learn your flag protocols. Precedence does not mean procedures.
@SenWarren First thing for you to do is get rid of your house, tear down the fences and go live in an apartment. The second thing is to empty your bank accounts and give the money away to the people begging on the streets. Then come back and talk about breaking the hold of the wealthy.
@TheDemocrats President Trump did not cause the problem. The parents of the children caused the problem. If they would obey our laws this would not happen. Make English the Official Language of the United States of America!
@RealJamesWoods Another word that was appropriated for the wrong reason. It is another way of people trying to make themselves feel better about themselves. When I grew up it meant happy and fun. Even the dictionary listed it that. There was never any mention of it meaning homosexual.
@RealJamesWoods If she has kids, what will they say? Look at my mom. People need to be aware of the future and act accordingly. Do you want to see your parents that way and have their pictures passed around?
@BernieSanders Start paying people what they are worth. Bernie Sanders would have to pay to talk.
@LightningDuck @CNN Do you think the swim (and it was probably in the middle of the night) helped in contributing to the illness?
@MikeMorePlease @BooTrump21 @TheDemocrats It figures you would use a child's guide.
@BooTrump21 @TheDemocrats I am declared a bot, again. Thanks.
@CNN Do you think she got the infection when she crossed into the US by swimming across the Rio Grand?
@Hilliard__ I have thought about this and maybe Bernie Sanders may be onto something. If take a good portion of the pay the players get and spread it around to populace we may be better off. Seconds thoughts, no. Do remind them they are getting paid for a job to be done.
@olarrysmom @oLARRY2K Our prayers also.
@JudicialWatch We need just one individual to come forward and say that Maxine Waters told him it was okay for violence through her encouragement at press conferences and rallies.
@preachdnb @BernieSanders @AndrewGillum Go human bots that say things that are true. I have been called a bot a few times and I am starting to take that as a compliment now so, Thanks.
@LincolnFresno To me, since the Steele dossier was a fabricated document paid for by the Hillary campaign then all arrests convictions and innuendoes from using that document should be null and void. Everyone should be released and all convictions removed and the investigation halted.
@kimguilfoyle @DailyCaller Are we absolutely sure her emails were hacked? It could be she allowed them access knowingly. How can we be sure without the actual server in place. The hard drive isn't the only thing that controls access to the machine. The BIOS could have spyware in it hardwired that way.
@LincolnFresno The pundits also started complaining about his heritage of being born to a military father and a Thai mother. How stupid are they? Just because they don't like his politics they automatically don't like him and he ends up being a racist not matter anything else. Go military!
@BernieSanders @AndrewGillum Yes, get out and vote for the right way, for the Trump supported candidates and not for socialism. Socialism will just take away your earning and eventually your freedoms. It has happened many times. Look at Venezuela.
@johncardillo Voter fraud comes in many forms. One time may be a mistake but more that becomes a fraud. It could also be that they don’t know how to read or are not paying attention to the details. Either way, it would amount to fraud. They need to be held accountable and reported.
@CNN That is one way to build their military.
@Thomas1774Paine Shouldn't Hillary go to prison anyway?
@CBPRGV @CBP If they are wanted criminals then make sure they are jailed and if their children are separated from them, so be it. If they are not wanted then send them back immediately and tell them to come in the right way. Obey our laws or have the laws changed.
@CNN Is this the reason they are making the seats smaller? Do they treat their foreign passengers the same as they treat their American passengers? Like crap.
@FoxNews We should have all the children in her class call her ma'am or may use the full term instead of the shortened term ma'am, madam.
@FoxNews @SenJohnMcCain At least he did send it ahead of time. How many news organizations had the headlines already written like the did when President Trump announced his Supreme Court nominee?
@maltyhops @BillyAmerican @ICEgov To get started you must first take a step. They now have taken 19 steps. There will definitely be more to come.
@KamalaHarris If you want to come to America, do it the right way, if not then go to another country. We don't need any more illegal alien invaders.
@KamalaHarris What about white women and Asian women? Don't they get the benfits also?
@KamalaHarris It is about time.
@GavinNewsom Why? Are you afraid he will rule according to the constitution?
@PeteFierRules @RepGosar Too late obama is out of office.
@SenKamalaHarris The leader of false information.
@FoxNews Are we sure the goats weren't trying to escape from a Eid UL-Adha celebration?
@4everfresnoshow Never blame yourself if you can blame it on anything else. Sour grapes.
@IngrahamAngle Here is what is bothering me. If the guy wants the child he has no say in what the woman does. If he doesn't want the child he still has no say and then the woman can hold the child over his head. The man should also have a say in the abortion as to whether he agrees with it.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Let's bring back more nuclear power plants. We need to build the small reactors like they have in France. We can do it and keep it safe. The spent nuclear rods can be reused many times until there is hardly anything left. Research the technology on them.
@SenSchumer Illegal Aliens have no place in America also. Who are they. We don't know because they sneak in to avoid detection. Why are they sneaking in? If they so good then why not come in the correct way?
@TheDemocrats @HowardU Get out the vote. Vote for the Conservatives. We want winners not whiners. Bring back American values and respect. Keep our country safe and secure. Make English the official language of the United States. Control our borders. Left only those we want in. Do not break our laws.
@MikeMorePlease @BooTrump21 @TheDemocrats love those bots - Ivan
@TheDemocrats Get out the vote. Vote for the Conservatives. We want winners not whiners. Bring back American values and respect. Keep our country safe and secure. Make English the official language of the United States. Control our borders. Left only those we want in. Do not break our laws.
@SenWarren You can really help end the corruption in wanshington by being the first to resign. Lead the way!
@CNN Can we please get a complete list of those denouncing the President? Tired of numbers without the backing. Give us the names.
@MannyCYC @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Followers do not make you correct.
@CNN Facebook, Twitter and YouTube kowtowing to the Chinese so why shouldn't they listening to some of the thing the US Government is requesting?
@MannyCYC @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Please name what laws he is breaking, be specific. No rumors or innuendos, just the facts.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump This is another reason we need to control our borders tightly. People are invading the country and we have no idea who they are. We need to start deporting them as soon as we find them. Do a complete bio-metric survey of them and then deport ASAP.
@FIREGlennSather @CNN Are you absolutely sure? Were you there when it was written? What about the Koran or the teachings of Gautama Buddha? Were they written by frauds? I am not that old so I can't say for sure, can you? If so, where is your proof? Not just rhetoric but actual verifiable proof.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @TeamCavuto That is correct. When my clearance was suspended after I got out of the military there were certain countries I could not travel to and somethings I could not talk about for at least 5 years.
@CNN What happened to freedom of speech? Oh yeah, that is right, this is for China.
@FoxNews Who are these Russian agents? Where are they? When did they start? What have they accessed so far? When are they going to be stopped? Are the people being target getting notified? Is Microsoft helping in the security of the sites?
@CNN I didn't see The Bible on that list.
@MarkYoungTruth @MichaelAvenatti Either it was CNN or MSNBC said Brennan had a lifetime security clearance. Never heard of such thing so it must be another one of those fake news things that CNN and MSNBC like doing.
@ElizabethHeng Get up to speed on the water problems and also the illegal aliens that are in the valley. I know it is a sore subject for many but it is a problem and it needs to be taken care of. My step son is on an 11 year waiting list to come here. Why do illegal aliens get to stay here?
@JudicialWatch Who are these people who are invading our country? Don't forget how young the MS13 gang members are and how the coyotes use anybody for smuggling drugs across the border. Come in the correct way and obey the laws. This applies to people of all ages, even the young ones.
@FoxNews Don't forget you are also allowed and even encouraged to kneel in church. Kevin, I suggest you start attending somewhere.
@ElizabethHeng You have been shadowed banned. Please start yelling and screaming about it. A supporter, replace costa.
@FoxNews Thank God we still have people who are willing to jump in and help.
@TheDemocrats I will vote for Conservatives especially those that are endorsed by President Trump. Vote for winners not whiners. Make America Great Again and not like Cuomo’s New York.
@RealJamesWoods I did not see give her the $100. Cough it up you idiot. Cowards who come from the back instead of face-to-face.
@ddale8 How is Toronto these days?
@RepJoeKennedy Heartless is letting a man like this on the streets of America. Where is our safety and security? Joe start doing your work for the American people, not illegal aliens!
@buitengebieden @TomHall Soylent K9
@RealKyleMorris Hastings please take a long swim in the atlantic ocean. Do you think you can show us how to swim to Bermuda? Without safety guides?
@RoShamBoProds @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Illegal aliens who are taking our jobs, using medical and educational facilities. Who are they? They don't want anybody to know so that is why they sneak in and break our laws. Being arrested for breaking the laws is not uncommon, I hope.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Spin and spin, don't rinse just repeat. Do no put things out completely just enough so it sounds like you want. Thugs - a few people. Husband arrested while wife going in for C-section. He was wanted in Mexico for murder.
@SenSanders Since you believe in socialism so much, why did they kick you out of a commune? I remember those communes and they were the height of socialism. Why was it you did not fit in?
@SenSanders Then they forget the dems also get the same tax breaks.
@GarbageHuman_ What college are they attending?
@AMike4761 Try Tide with bleach.
@songbird145A @IgnitedTrueWord @TheDemocrats @WhitfordBradley Whatever, but that is still a fifties style haircut.
@kellidragon4 Paris Dennard is absolutely correct. Private companies pay more if you have a security clearance. I know this for a fact.
@RealJamesWoods Come think of it, I need to get half of what is remaining. At that rate how much would be left in a day?
@RealJamesWoods Perfect example.
@IgnitedTrueWord @TheDemocrats @WhitfordBradley They are bring back the fifties hair style.
@TheDemocrats @WhitfordBradley Go Trump!
@lynnmasters17 like the hat, you should go to Clovis CA on big hat day.
@AMike4761 This is another reason we need to stop illegal immigration. We need to know the background of the people who want to live. We also need their health status before they enter the country. We have legal ports of entry and they must apply to come here. Do it the correct way.
@HarryWh61174636 @BreakingNLive Careful, we don't want to give criminals a bad name.
@SenGillibrand How well do you remember the movement?
@UCBerkeley Buy ramen.
@TheDemocrats Yes, vote for Trump. Back a winner, not a whiner!
@mrdefender1983 @CNN Exactly!
@SenGillibrand You spout false information and bullshit.
@FoxNews Revoke them all, they don't need them. Just because they want them it doesn't mean they can have them. I want a million dollars but the bank won't give it to me either. They are no longer in NEED of a clearance.
@UCBerkeley Oh darn, I was hoping you meant Jesus. US Berkeley does need his help too.
@CNN It seems like nobody can do anything without somebody complaining about it. Give us news not opinions. What happening on the streets of Chicago and when is it going to be safe there?
@RepSwalwell What an idiot. Did you forget about 401ks. All the people who have a 401k and the corporations are doing better that helps them. Stocks going up help them and you. Quit complaining about tax cuts, start working on spending cuts. That will help everybody out. Do you job!
@45th_FLOTUS My mother, ex-wife and current wife are all immigrant (legal of course) so I understand what goes on for immigrants. My current wife though is wondering why English is not the official language of America. Please advocate for English as the official language.
@ElizabethHeng Please get out there and start letting the people in the district know what you stand for. I not heard nor seen very much about your campaign so it needs to ramped up a bit more. Get with 580 and see if you can get more interviews for name recognition.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @SouthwestAir How do you fly? Do you fly coach? Did you fly coach to Korea? I bet because you have money you fly business or first class. Do you grab military jets like some of your colleagues?
@ddale8 ICE doing its job. Illegal need to leave then come back in legally. If you get caught here illegally you may not have that chance. Hard but many immigrants have already done it. Illegals are not better than anyone else!
@KamalaHarris They can cut out their booze, drugs and cigarettes.
@JohnJamesMI @FoxNews Which seat did you fly in? Left, Right, Front or Back?
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @nytimes So what is the big deal? Dems appoint judges to uphold Roe V Wade. Turn about is fair play. We need judges that will not make up laws and will uphold the Constitution!
@TheDemocrats What are the dems doing other than jumping all over President Trump. I do not see them doing anything other than complaining and helping illegal aliens. Get off your lazy A**es and get to work for the AMERICAN people!
@RepSwalwell That is an honor that can readily be granted. The Admiral does not really need the clearance if he is retired. He may want it if he is going for another job but he probably living very well off his retirement pay so it is really no skin off his back. Sit back and enjoy retirement
@chuckwoolery You can get better news on Ancient Aliens than on CNN and it is more timely.
@TheDemocrats How about the illegal aliens here taking up seats in our classrooms? They take up seats in the colleges where an American should be going. They are only paying in-state fees where they should be paying double international fees and only on after everyone else gets’ in the class.
@4everfresnoshow You may be Americans but that does not mean you are not embellishing the facts. I want to know if you are digging up the facts such as when an accident occurs and an illegal alien is involved do you mention that fact or just let it slide. We would like to have the full picture.
@chuckwoolery Pearl Jam and tester need to retire and go back to obscurity.
@foxandfriends @TheOfficerTatum I have never seen a soldier while in uniform take a knee during the National Anthem. The players say they respect the military I am call BS on that. The only thing they respect is their pay checks.
@Thomas1774Paine Did they say what his illness is? Where does it hurt? Is it physical or mental? Oh, so many questions with no answers. Please give us the details. Like the left says, we have the right to the details.
@rendale @WhiteHouse I guess you want us to look up to hillary or bill? Where do they lead the way. Even obama wasn't to fond of bill or hillary.
@FoxNews Cuomo is leading the way in making America an immoral country. He is starting with New York. We need to make sure he doesn't go any further. Do not reelect him. Put him out to pasture and don't even let him act as a stud.
@THEHermanCain But they want to take the credit. They cannot stand it when they don't get their way and somebody else makes them look bad.
@TheDemocrats Here is what is at stake. Supreme Court Judges doing their job and not the bidding of the democrats who want power.
@amber_athey @CNN I hear but please provide facts with backup and documentation. People yakking like rye are just self serving hypocrites. "If I don't like it then it is wrong." They never get passed their own prejudices. They think everyone else is wrong.
@FoxNews @HarveyLevinTMZ A voice that will live forever and be missed forever.
@DailyCaller Bernie Sanders is leading the way on immorality. He hoards his money and doesn't help those in need. Let's examine his tax returns to see how much he gave in donations. Does he attend any type of religious organization? How does he try to help people other than take their money?
@chuckwoolery @BreitbartNews If revoking security clearances will suppress criticism then revoke away!
@chuckwoolery it is hard to say anything that has not been said before. This guy needs to be investigated and all his croonies with him. He should never be allowed near anything classified again.
@2jfHoward @KamVTV Paper? What is paper?
@CNN Imagine what she has been teaching our children.
@CNN Didn't she leave the country?
@JxhnBinder When are my grandchildren going to be even allowed to stay here let alone citizenship. No way get them out of MY country!
@penelope7usa Why? Take back America. Make America Great again. Judges do something right for a change! One child is dead already and they let it go like it is nothing. Why?
@LifeZette She says breaking the law is breaking the law. What about the illegals in her city? When is she going to get them off the streets? Aren't they breaking the law?
@chuckwoolery Bring back Pledge of Allegiance, school prayer and the holey board of education in our schools. If the parents don't like it then they can pay to go their own school but make sure they abide by all the appropriate laws governing schools.
@FoxNews Can we say Sanctuary State?
@FoxNews @JohnBrennan @foxnewsnight If he gets to keep his clearance then I want my TS SBI SSIR A210 Clearance back.
@JerilynneGraue @ericbolling I hope so.
@ericbolling Johnny boy yelling about the loss of his clearance and taking away his first amendment rights. No, they just took away his ability to gather classified data to hold over anybody. Welcome to the real world Johnny.
@tedlieu You are in South Korea at the museum in Youngsan-gu near the US and UN base near youngsan in Seoul. You may have even gone to either the embassy club or dragon hill hotel for dinner.
@FoxNews Part of the problem also may be due to illegals entering into the US. We do not know what vaccinations they have or what diseases they have. Until they start coming in correctly this is going to hard to track down.
@UCBerkeley Don't they get enough sleep in their overpriced safe places in the university classes? How about teaching them hard work so they will get that feeling of accomplishment?
@dbongino Do you think he is going to donate his money to those who don't want to work. If he does, when do I get some? There is a whole line of people ahead of me though including all the politicians.
@CNN If they think they are going to lose or have already lost it must be a hack or something other than their fault. Check with hillary about that, she has it down pat.
@TheJusticeDept Another murdered in California? Don't we have enough already? No delay, send him back. Make sure their justice system gets a chance to work.
@KamalaHarris You need to work for the American people! We are a nation of laws. Blame the parents for being separated from their children. American citizens who go to jail get separated from their children. Obey the laws or suffer the punishment. Americans are being ignored
@BreakingNLive It is about time.
@RepJimCosta It is not gridlock, it is you are representing the American people. Start working for the American people and not the illegal aliens!
@SenKamalaHarris Where is your degree in climatology or meteorology? What about the guys who are the ground in the thick of it. Doesn't their word mean anything? It seems like since what they are saying doesn't fit with your neat little teaching they are wrong. Try to learn instead of repeat.
@RealJamesWoods We really need to make English the Official language and start teaching it in schools again.
@McClanahanV @CNN @AnushayHossain @CNNOpinion Last time I checked that saying was no filter not know filter.
@McClanahanV @CNN @AnushayHossain @CNNOpinion What is a know filter?
@SebGorka Pick them up and give them a choice of which country they want to go to as long as it out of the USA. Make sure the airline ticket is below coach with only one carry on bag.
@TheDemocrats Unfortunately I do not have a republican senator. You want republicans to vote No so I guess that means you want the democrats to vote Yes. So I am tell my democrat senator to vote Yes on Kavanaugh's nomination. Thank You.
@SenSanders You want, you pay. It is not my obligation to pay for what you want. I have paid enough for people who do not deserve a thing from me. Illegal aliens, drug addicts and such need to have personal responsibility for their own actions. If you don't like it don't do it.
@TheDemocrats Find one higher education school that is not a for profit school. It is hard to find a school that is not of the public dole. They want their cake and eat it too. We need to get rid of some of these schools and get more trade schools in their place. It should be a 2 to 1 trade.
@SenGillibrand The people that are most targeted are the people on fixed income especially after the states add more taxes and fees they have to pay without an increase in their income. If you want to help get rid of some of the onerous taxes and fees you help put in.
@seanhannity Could not have happened to a nicer guy. Have a nice life but do not let him keep his clearance.
@amber_athey @CNN I don't think they regret saying that their employees are non-violent. They just gave them pay raises to have a living wage.
@FoxNews We all could learn something from them.
@RealJamesWoods @CNN Do you have idea how much CNN and MSNBC are paying the protesters? I am looking for a job where I can get my frustrations out without any consequences. The only problem may be that I have different frustrations than most of them.
@NancyPelosi A culture of corruption? We have to pass it to see what is in it sounds like you want to hoodwink the American people. You should have read it before forcing it upon the American public. We have the right to know instead having things thrust upon us in the middle of the night!
@thenationsrage @Ocasio2018 Socialism does not promote personal responsibility. It does not help those who help themselves. It takes the money that you earn and puts it toward others who don't want to work. The talk sounds good but look under the hood and find out what is really going on.
@NancyPelosi @HouseDemocrats You talk about improving the policy for the American people, then why did you say we have to pass it to see what is in it? How does that help the American people? We need to know that YOU are working on our behalf,
@4everfresnoshow Why would a court take up a case like this? If they do then every time a person get injured while stealing, mugging or other criminal act can get rich by suing the people or property owners. Bad precedence if it is even taken up by a court.
@AllenWest Is there any penalty for lying on the census? If a family says they are citizens but they are what will happen then?
@Jamierodr10 @TheJusticeDept A bare mid-drift, you have got to kidding me. Another "woman" that make sex hard to think about. If a guy did that to her we would already have his head on a pole. What about equal treatment? Is that just a saying or does it mean something? Find her, jail her.
@TheBabylonBee And the count won!
@cwilliamswrites You got me on that. I saw one thing and was thinking another. Thanks for tell ing me.
@stuartmulin @IngrahamAngle We are discussing china not the economy, yet.
@IngrahamAngle Obama should have tackled this situation when they started making those islands. He just let it go like he did for many things in the world that are coming back to bite us in the rear end. It is now a scary situation developing. What are we to do? I have no answers.
@TheDemocrats Health care is something you pay for. It is neither a right nor a privilege. A few occupations offer it as a part of package during employment. It was offered by many companies before obama get his fingers into it. Who will pay for health care workers?
@FCDallasMom2 @RWPUSA Staying on topic, fienstein has been telling her husband for years about the bills she votes on so he can build his business. He is a real estate developer. Why should he get advanced knowledge of the bills before the rest of us. That is call insider trading.
@micahcohen @ABCPolitics @ballotpedia Hundreds of Races? Caucasoids, Negroids, Mongoloids and Australoids are the four major races of humans. The rest of what they call race is culture and nationality and other self-determined names. Hispanic is a culture not a race.
@RWPUSA Are you going to tell feinstein to stop telling her husband what and how she is going to vote on bills that affect him?
@FoxNews What is good for the goose is good for the gander.
@Jillibean557 Thaat has turned me off to sex for at least a month!
@KamalaHarris Over and over again: We are a nation of laws. Blame the parents for being separated from their children. American citizens who go to jail get separated from their children. Blame it on the parents, not the laws. Obey our laws or suffer the punishment. Americans are being ignored.
@dncpress @TomPerez Pennsylvania: where the dems encourage the illegal aliens to come and rape their children. Isn't about time the dems realize that they are causing harm to the American people? Where is the common sense? No more dancing in the offices for sanctuary city status.
@AllenWest People need to pull their children from that school. If there was a way they should be able to stop all federal/state money from going to that school. They pay property taxes to keep those schools going and the school need to be for American citizens. It should not be for illegal
@CctriadCarroll Great I made a list. Don't know what for, but it is nice to be noticed. Thanks.
@EveHammond13 @FoxNews @TimesofIsrael What has this to do with the rapist?
@SenatorDurbin What stakes? Just because you don't like someone does not mean they are bad. Besides nobody is hiding anything from you, you just want the headlines.
@FoxNews The environmentalist policies are completely hurting CA. They will not the forest be manages, allow dams to be built and try to protect a smelt fish which was brought in to feed the trout which were brought in for sport fishing. Environmentalism sounds nice, but they hurt CA.
@RepCummings We can make it certain. No dream act, make them like regular illegal aliens, which they are. No special privileges. People doing it legally are not getting any, why should they? Blame the parents if you want. They brought them here.
@RepCummings They should have never done it in the first place. Get in line. Just because you brought here illegally by your parents does not give you special privileges. My step son brought his kids here legally on a tourist visa but they are not getting any special privileges.
@RepGosar @repandybiggs Agreed also to help get the wall paid for start charging a 10% fee for all those money orders that are cashed south of the US Border. Charge on all bank transfers that go south of the border also. This will pay for the wall from countries that are primarily invading our country.
@USAHotLips Thank Good the mute button works.
@Alf65123 @AMike4761 Bernie, is this what you want for America? Tell you what, go to Mexico and run for President there. If you get in and it works out then come back and we will see if we want to be subjugated.
@Alf65123 @AMike4761 Soylent Green
@IngrahamAngle @WashTimes Wall, wall, wall. We need to make it harder and not welcoming for illegal aliens. If the families have to be separated because of jail, so be it. It is their fault for not obeying our laws. Just because they want does not mean we should let them in. It is our country not theirs!
@GavinNewsom Purveyor of fake news!   Over and over again: We are a nation of laws. Blame the parents for being separated from their children. Blame it on the parents, not the laws. Obey our laws or suffer the punishment. Americans are being ignored.
@FoxNews The whole government of Philadelphia needs to be held accountable. The police need to notify ICE. The American Citizens need to start pushing for the city to do the right thing and start enforcing all the laws and make safety and security the top priority!
Everybody is trying to catch the criminals except the dems. https://t.co/vBQBXtbayM
@RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump It is time that conservatives start pushing back. I have seen it over and over where we just take it on the chin and say we are better. We may be better but we don't have to sit back and take it. We need to push back on what we believe WHEN we are confronted.
@BreakingNLive Thank You.
@wicho1949 @AGBecerra What color do you have in mind? I am talking about only American citizens voting in the election. Green card holders, visitors and illegal aliens do not have the right to vote in our elections. That is the law and nowhere did I mention color &amp; yes I enjoy the red, white and blue.
@FrankPallone Over and over again: We are a nation of laws. Blame the parents for being separated from their children. American citizens who go to jail get separated from their children. Blame it on the parents, not the laws. Obey our laws or suffer the punishment. Americans are being ignored.
@DiamondandSilk A spy getting retirement from the government, illegals getting aid and comfort from state governments. Meanwhile we have retired people on Social Security being overtaxed and no representation from congress.
@ChrisCoons @realDonaldTrump @RudyGiuliani Do you think that would also apply to the steele document the hillary paid for? If so then shouldn't hillary be held accountable?
@JohnJamesMI Apache Pilot? Apache flight simulator technician. Helped installed the first Apache simulator at Ft. Hood. Also worked on the Huey, Cobra, UH60 and the Chinook. Good Luck.
@PhilMcCrackin44 @repCohen1 @RubyRockstar333 @pinkk9lover @PatrioticVa @ArizonaKayte @bbusa617 @PatriotJenn @REALtrumpbureau @alozras411 @Chicago1Ray @Pickles0201 Give him the Purple Heart? First, draft him into the military. Second, put him on the front line. Third, see if he can earn the Purple Heart. No hiding behind big rocks.
@mamendoza480 The judge should have at least notified ICE of the subject BEFORE he was turned loose.
@mamendoza480 Actions have consequences. The actions of this judge have led to loss of life of an American citizen by the hands of an invader of this country. The DOJ needs to look into the matter and see if there was collusion between the criminal and the judge.
@RMConservative Allow transgender in when they allow obesity in the military. All standards should apply to everyone. If you have a problem or a difficulty in your life it is not the responsibility of the military to help you through it, especially if that problem started before your enlisted.
@JxhnBinder My thoughts to those who think Americans are against them: Don't come here, especially if you cannot follow our laws. I know a few people who want to come here and do it legally but they are on a waiting list to get and they are willing to wait. Love it or leave it.
@AMike4761 I wonder when Sharia Law is going to take over. I hope the women of Germany like being subjugated by people who think they are better than them. Didn't that happen in Germany before? It seems like no one bothers to learn history anymore including in the US.
@President1Trump I wonder if the guys’ mother has seen this. It seems like he always commenting about his mother and what she does. I think we should send the video to his mother and see what she has to say about it. Bring back discipline and prayer.
@AdamSchiffCA Yes, I agree with Trump "attacking" Adam, Whoever adam is. As far as chip in i will send you account number you can donate to me.
@AGBecerra Remember what you said "every American's right to vote." Not non-citizen and especially not illegal aliens. They do not have the right to vote nor should they ever.
@SenFeinstein @ShawkanZeid What about when Journalist starts into fiction without telling anyone what they are writing is fiction. They need to be held to higher standard if they want to be believed. There are many journalists who embellish their stories with their own views instead of just the facts.
@CNN Is there anyone else out there that is heartbroken when they did not get something?
@CNN I was heart broken when I did not get the winning lottery ticket.
@NancyPelosi From what I see it is the dems who are attacking the voters by wanting to include the non-citizens and illegal aliens in our most protected right. Voting in American is for American Citizens ONLY!
@RepJimCosta While breastfeeding is important for our children I want know what are you doing about the invasion of illegal aliens? What are you doing about the out of control environmental policies? What are doing to get more water storage in the central valley? What are doing?
@FoxNews Which picture is the son and which pictures is the daughter?
@GOPLeader The wildfires are the result of the environmentalist demands and acquiescence by gov brown and his ilk to not manage the forest. Put the blame on them for the large fires, not "Climate Change." If the forests were managed correctly the chances of great fires would be diminished.
@RuthieRedSox Why are they still giving away those phones? They should pay for them just like everyone else.
@RepGosar Counting legal non-citizens is fine. They are here and trying to abide by our laws. Counting illegal aliens should not happen. If found they should be deported and let the legal aliens in. It is only fair. We do not know who the illegal aliens are. Remember how they got here!
@LoriDBaker @RealCandaceO They are, they have been hired to protest. I know it is a dirty job but they don't have to do it. They should go on strike demanding more pay to make it a living wage job. Where can I sign up? I am sure I can show up and look silly.
@FoxNews I love it! This is not the first time. We had that happen here in CA also. They pulled the lady out, jumped in, and did not know how to even get into first gear. Stalled it out. I do not know if they were caught but maybe the will enroll in drivers ed for manuals.
@maryderrickart @FoxNews @JohnJamesMI @realDonaldTrump @VP Over and over again: We are a nation of laws. Blame the parents for being separated from their children. American citizens who go to jail get separated from their children. Blame it on the parents, not the laws. Obey our laws or suffer the punishment. Americans are being ignored
@FoxNews @foxandfriends @jasoninthehouse Scorched earth is correct - look what their policies are doing to California. Their demand that environmentalist get their way and not managing the forest are the reason the wildfires are getting so large.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump So says comrade swalwell.
@diebohican @hfinch61 @realDonaldTrump No, it was in the 90's when the president was getting down in the White House.
@hfinch61 @realDonaldTrump Matt Lewis has no idea if he thinks Trump convinced us that the media is biased. All Trump did was tell us what he wanted to do and so far he is holding to that. Which is more than I can say about any politician.
@LincolnFresno @POTUS @KMJNOW Whoopi and the Judge.
@FoxNews Been watching too many movies. Pushing a few buttons. Definitely watching too many movies.
@SenWarren Are you holding a pow wow for the Kavanaugh?
@KeiraJaneReed1 @puika1999 @FoxNews You do what you need to do to make a living and stay out of trouble. It is not easy but it can be done. Just keep your goals in mind and try to have fun along the way.
@KeiraJaneReed1 @puika1999 @FoxNews Some of the jobs I have are paperboy, sold cards door-to-door, sold TV guides door-to-door, mowed lawns, washed cars, cook, dishwasher, bus boy, waiter, taxi driver, worked on a dairy farm, lifeguard, janitor, electronics technician, military and a business owner.
@KeiraJaneReed1 @puika1999 @FoxNews Yes, I hear, there are no jobs for me. The jobs are there but they may not be they glamorous job you want, but there are jobs available.I have had to work jobs I didn’t like but I did it because I wanted to get ahead.
@KeiraJaneReed1 @puika1999 @FoxNews It is not up to the corporations to give you what you want or even demand. They do not have to hire you. Their job it to make money for their shareholders and they do that by selling product. There are plenty of jobs out there if you really want them. You just have to WORK.
@KeiraJaneReed1 @puika1999 @FoxNews One big way to decrease inflation is for people to realize that not every job is a "living wage" job. Some jobs are starter job and part time jobs. If you really want a living wage job you work your way up to it and learn it. Go to schools, even trade schools to get ahead.
@KeiraJaneReed1 @puika1999 @FoxNews The cost of shipping the products to market will go up because of the wage increase in the people who transport it. The cost of gas will go up because the cost of the wages for the oil workers will go up. People will start demanding that they get even more to keep them level.
@KeiraJaneReed1 @puika1999 @FoxNews When the minimum wage is raised several things can go one. The number of people they hire may have to be reduced; pay raises in the future may have to cut. Fewer full time employees will be kept on. Raising the cost of the product may lead to fewer items being sold.
@KeiraJaneReed1 @puika1999 @FoxNews These corporations are the basis for our retirements among the everyday people. We want the corporations to do well so our 401k and other retirement vehicles become worth more so we will have a decent retirement. For the corporations to do good they must look at their spending.
@KeiraJaneReed1 @puika1999 @FoxNews Everybody says that the corporations are too greedy. Who owns the corporations? Sure it run by the CEO but it is the shareholders who own it. Who are the shareholders? They are everyday people like you and I. We want these corporations to do good so we make money.
@KeiraJaneReed1 @puika1999 @FoxNews The reason we have inflation is that every time we increase the minimum wage the cost of that good goes up. When it gets too high people will not buy it and they will look for other places to get it cheaper. That is also why people go overseas to buy products.
@KeiraJaneReed1 @puika1999 @FoxNews We want the people from overseas to buy our products. That is the way we can increase our income. Corporation need to make money to keep expanding and to hire people. We live in a capitalist society and it is not against the law to make money.
@KeiraJaneReed1 @puika1999 @FoxNews The only way to sell our products and services is to make them cheaper and better quality than anyone else. That is the way the rest of the world come and knock on our doors to buy what we have. The rest of the world needs to look to the US for quality instead of overseas.
@KeiraJaneReed1 @puika1999 @FoxNews The federal minimum wage in 1980 was $3.10 per hour. It is now $7.25 an hour. That is more than double. I will grant you the buying power is not all that much but in actual terms it has gone up. What we need is to be selling our products and services.
@KeiraJaneReed1 @puika1999 @FoxNews If we raise wages everything else goes up.. There is no way around it. People and corporations want to make money but the more something costs the more they have to charge for it. Raising wages is not the answer. Food, housing &amp; wages are increased. Where does it end? Venezuela?
@FoxNews During my time as waiter I was paid less than $1.00 an hour. Well below minimum wage. I also like the OLD Japanese way which was you don't leave a tip unless you were dissatisfied with the service. You need to get better service so here is a few yen to make that happen.
@FoxNews I have been a short order cook, waiter, bus boy and dishwasher. It was nice to get a tip but I came not to expect (or demand) one. People would like to eat out from time to time and not to have to pay extra for good service. The servers need to give good service no matter what.
@SenGillibrand This one again, waste of twitter space. Go Kavanaugh!
@Tweets4DJT Every non-citizen needs to be their best. An illegal will never be the best until they straightened out their status, and even then they need to be on their best behavior. Those that kill others while they here illegally need to get the maximum! Where is our security?
@john_vischio @charliekirk11 @sarahjeong @Twitter Had nothing to do with plagiarism. She said in her tweet actually what she did which was replace white with black and asked how it felt. That was spelled out in her tweet.
@charliekirk11 @sarahjeong @Twitter Definitely says you can debase whites but every other race is protected.
@Twitter Is sarah jeong banned from twitter?
@seanhannity The motive will lie with Mindanao in the Philippines. That is where a  group of terrorist Muslims reside. His girlfriend went to that area.
@KamalaHarris Yes, Trump needs your votes so get out there and register. Keep the Trump administration going!
@chuckwoolery Sorry but how was he threatened? Did somebody yell the truth at him to scare him? Maybe he can't handle the truth and that scares him. I don't how telling the truth will put his life in danger.
@RealCandaceO Don't forget what she thinks about women who have been abused by her husband.
@TheDemocrats Over and over again: We are a nation of laws. Blame the parents for being separated from their children. American citizens who go to jail get separated from their children. Blame it on the parents, not the laws. Obey our laws or suffer the punishment. Americans are being ignored.
@AMike4761 He is going to be one messed up kid.
@doug_wright1 @chuckwoolery could just say ebonics.
@chuckwoolery Look hard enough and long enough and you find racism in everything.
@SenBooker @CoryBooker @ChrisCoons @SenatorIsakson Are you going to request that the dems accept our elections and quit harassing those who support our president? You should also ask to stop trying to get the Green card holders and illegal aliens the vote. They are not US citizens.
@FoxNews @ellisonbarber What about all those who have been waiting for years to come here legally? Why do illegal aliens get a benefit for having broken the law, no matter how it was done? Go to the back of the line and let those who are doing it legally in ahead of all illegal aliens.
@KamalaHarris I want to know more, why are you telling me that is all I need to Know?
@darrenrpowers I remember hooking them up in St. Anthony back in 1970. It was a lot of fun. I wish I could go back.
@jeff776588468 @FoxNews Where to, New York?
@SebGorka Since she hates America so much she can go back to the Democratic Republic of Congo where she came from. I think that would be well suited fine to be given to her for her actions and statements. I am sure she would appreciate because the country is so bad according to her.
@FoxNews Since she hates America so much she needs to have her green card revoked and she need to be sent back to where she immigrated from. If a person decides they don't like America and isn't willing to obey the laws then they should be forced to leave and find another home.
@FoxNews He knew if got in the back of the patrol car his goose would have been cooked.
@FoxNews @GeraldoRivera It is nice to be compassionate but what about the laws and fairness. What about all those who have been waiting for years to come here legally? Why do illegal aliens get a benefit for having broken the law, no matter how it was done? Go to the back of the line.
@MattBracken48 @SebGorka I wonder if she thinks she is a fire hydrant?
@CNN That is their prerogative. If the employees don't like it they can always go to another job. They are not working in bernie sanders world, yet. At least they have those neat brown suits.
@SenGillibrand I wonder how many times she is going to send out the fake information tweet. It is getting boring and ridiculous. This tweet says "paid for by gillibrand for senate." How much did they pay for tweet? They will probably take it off on their taxes.
@AMike4761 Make sure her and hillary do not share a cell together.
@USAHotLips @TheDemocrats Maybe he just likes to cry, the baby.
@AMike4761 Finally, a great idea worthy of following!m Are you listening dems?
@FoxNews Aren't most syringes plastic?
@MarkYoungTruth I wish people would understand there are only 4 races. Check it out. By the way Hispanics are white by their DNA, unless they are black or Asian. Hispanic is a culture not a race. Mexican is a nationality not a race. Check it out. Use an encyclopedia or just google it.
@MarkYoungTruth Russians trying to influence our election with ads and the dems are trying to influence the elections by using foreign agents known as illegal aliens to actually vote in our elections. The only voters are supposed to be American citizens.
@DevinNunes @Doranimated @Twitter I guess to some people the truth is betrayal. Keep telling the truth. It is hard but eventually the truth will win out.
@DiamondandSilk Russians trying to influence our election with ads and the dems are trying to influence the elections by using foreign agents known as illegal aliens to actually vote in our elections. The only voters are supposed to be American citizens.
@MoneyForUse @DailyCaller @JesseBWatters Remember the therapist will make up new diseases every chance they can so they can line their pockets with more money. This also gives their "patients" an excuse to be idiots.
@realDonaldTrump Russians trying to influence our election with ads and the dems are trying to influence the elections by using foreign agents known as illegal aliens to actually vote in our elections. The only voters are supposed to be American citizens.
@CNN There are no official qualifications for becoming a Supreme Court justice. The Constitution spells out age, citizenship and residency requirements for becoming president of the United States or a member of Congress but mentions no rules for joining the nation's highest court.
@FoxNews Hungry! There is enough left for tuna fish head soup.
@CNN Fake conservative, ha; do you remember what you ran on? This emission control proposal complaints coming from a guy who drives around in a Hummer. You messed up California when you were given the job. Just sit down a shut up and keep up pants zipped up. Go make another movie.
@carldemaio @DevinNunes Thank you Devin Nunes, when you are on a fixed income like Social Security people cannot afford increases in taxes and fees when there is not increase in income. That is part of the reason CA is so expensive.
@FoxNews @McDonalds Where are those salads made? So much for the healthier food. I want my old unhealthy food back.
@chuckwoolery What does she have to offer the DOJ other than not trying to run again? Oh wait, obama's DOJ, in bed together not negotiating.
@CNN Russians trying to influence our election with ads and the dems are trying to influence the elections by using foreign agents known as illegal aliens to actually vote in our elections. The only voters are supposed to be American citizens. Where does Panetta stand on this?
@MarkYoungTruth Meathead - Treason?   Russians trying to influence our election with ads and the dems are trying to influence the elections by using foreign agents known as illegal aliens to actually vote in our elections. The only voters are supposed to be American citizens.
@MarkYoungTruth Meathead -   Russians trying to influence our election with ads and the dems are trying to influence the elections by using foreign agents known as illegal aliens to actually vote in our elections. The only voters are supposed to be American citizens.
@SenGillibrand Senators you need to vote - vote for Kavanaugh!
@realDonaldTrump I am not too sure about that. Remember the reported that ask Sandra Bullock what is like working in outer space after she made the movie gravity? It is a toss up.
@eScarry My grandchildren are here visiting, why can't they stay with me as long  as they want? Because doing so is against the law until they are allowed  to immigrate. current waiting time is 11 years. What makes DACA better  than my grandchildren? Nothing, they are here illegally.
@anntensity My grandchildren are here visiting, why can't they stay with me as long as they want? Because doing so is against the law until they are allowed to immigrate. current waiting time is 11 years. What makes DACA better than my grandchildren? Nothing, they are here illegally.
@primalpoly She is an insult to the Korean people. Pabo ajima.
@AnnCoulter Russians trying to influence our election with ads and the dems are trying to influence the elections by using foreign agents known as illegal aliens to actually vote in our elections. The only voters are supposed to be American citizens.
@ErikaMcdougall @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @sarahjeong Listened to that bearman guy and he has no idea what he is mumbling about. He talks about personal experience and he has no idea what she went through if anything. He is trying to make Koreans out as a suppressed people when they are not.
@FoxNews Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders don't want you to keep your money. You will have to give it to them for redistribution among those that don't want to work. They are entitled to it.
@SenWarren @SEC_News Try a savings account instead of stock brokers. You should only buy stocks with money that you are willing to flush down the toilet. It has a risk. Take some personal responsibility in your actions.
@brithume Ajima, Manu pabo.
@marklevinshow They yak about Russian collusion but the dems don't realize trying to get illegal aliens to vote is also foreign interference with our elections.
@corvalues You know you are getting old when a biker hold the door for you and says "after you, sir."
@AnnCoulter Sorry to say but Asians do not get as much special treatment as the illegal aliens get. We even have to learn their language whereas the Asians try to learn ours.
@Robertcassell51 @GarbageHuman_ @NickSzabo4 Sorry, but they don't reach the status of Mad Magazine.
@SenFeinstein Release your insider trading info with your husband! Vote Kavanaugh in.
@SenKamalaHarris Where are your full records? Until then vote him in.
@DiamondandSilk I saw him jumping up and down yelling "look at me, pay attention to me, I am here!" Oh wait a minute, that was a 3 year old in a mall.
@FoxNews Start selling your stuff and keep your pants zipped.
@SenFeinstein @SenKamalaHarris Show us the science, not hearsay. Just the facts, ma'am, just the facts.
@KamalaHarris 2/2 There is suppression for communities of color. I was with one individual when she registered to vote. They asked to see an ID card to verify name. They looked at it &amp; that was all. I asked them "Don't you check for citizenship?" They said "No, we take it on faith." Wrong.
@KamalaHarris 1/2 You very wrong! Voting is the most important an American citizens has and it needs to be protected above all else. We need tighter controls over who votes. They must be a verified citizen of the US and not someone who just shows up on the doorstep.
@SenSanders Who did the study? What group did they question? When was it done? What area of the country? Did they ask anyone in the military? Was it only done in big cities? How many of the respondents were American citizens? Give me the facts. I can no longer take things on blind faith.
@AGBecerra @realDonaldTrump What those guns used to defend our children and loved ones?
@SenKamalaHarris Imagine how many apt &amp; homes would be if there were not illegal aliens in the country. Imagine how schools would be if there were not so many illegal alien children in them. Imagine how many more starter jobs there would be if there not so many illegal aliens taking them.
@CNN Charge the customers with a recycling fee if they bring it to the store instead of a recycling center. What other countries is this happening in to become a global movement? Watching several different news channels I have not seen any reporting of this. NHK, KBS and BBC.
@FoxNews @foxandfriends She has no respect for the American people, the veterans and even her own grandfather. She needs to resign and apologize to her entire district for her actions. She has no idea what the flag means.
@GavinNewsom I have heard people talk about climate change but I have to see the scientific proof of it. There is talk, but no actual findings available for the public to view along with how the scientist have determined their findings.
@SenKamalaHarris Kamala Harris has proven she will work harder for illegal aliens instead of the American citizens. She will work hard to take your money away for her socialist programs.
@nytimes how many white men work for you? how many white men subscribe to your rag?
@sarahjeong pabo
@CNN @StCollinson I am telling Sessions to shut down the Mueller probe and now I am making it an order. CNN are you satisfied now. Someone has ordered it.
@gehrig38 That's like an ex-wife will not embellish tales against the ex-husband. Come on give me a break, they are hoping for the attention and a lot of money from the "offender." In today's time the "offender" is automatically guilty whether they did it or not.
@FoxNews Alright!
@CAStateParks @CA_DWR where are the signs in Japanese, Korea, Chinese and the other languages that people speak when they visit the parks. Spanish isn't the only other language that is spoken at the state parks. English only or list all the other languages.
@RepMimiWalters Do you agree with maxine waters?
@Vall76089154 Both, a mental jihadist.
@chuckwoolery Let them yell and when sharia law is imposed they will not be able to yell.
@FoxNews @RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump obstruction of justice. Steele dossier? Paid for by hillary's campaign? Who is obstructing justice with collusion? The investigation should have never started with this as the basis. Every thing found during the investigation needs to be dismissed
@TheDemocrats Let's help the dems, vote for Trump, vote for conservatives. Let the dems know we are tired of them giving away our money!
@TheRealVAnon @Acosta He hears it and his mind is telling him that he is yelling it. It doesn't matter what the reality is.
@charliekirk11 She is part of the 1% of the 1%. The upper crust, the high and powerful and all that junk.
@CNN Over and over again: We are a nation of laws. Blame the parents for being separated from their children. American citizens who go to jail get separated from their children. Blame it on the parents, not the laws. Obey our laws or suffer the punishment. Americans are being ignored.
@chuckwoolery Which organs are they offering? I hope they are not trying to sell them because that would be illegal.
@SenFeinstein Wouldn't not securing our borders also allow terrorists and criminals get into our country with unrestricted, unlicensed and untraceable weapons?
@jkj4411 @AnnCoulter @maziehirono So, if you fly in on United you are welcomed into the US? Is the senators house surrounded by a fence. If we crash through that fence is she going to invite us to dinner? Do we get to sleep there forever? Please let us know. Also how much is the senator going to pay us?
@Tweetsfor45 her name is Stephanie and she drives a black Mercedes. She also likes to flaunt her body and she thinks she is hot sh*t. watch her toss her hair back and thrust our her chest. *I am pretty and I can do whatever I like*
@FoxNews where is the email? You talk about it but don't show it. Could it be another hoax? Who sent it? Why was it sent? Come on, the details, please. If it is really as bad as you think then I am against it. If it is another hoax get the person who sent it.
@tictoc @SenMarkey A bigger risk are socialist trying to take over the government.
@flywithkamala @SenFeinstein @JudiciaryDems You talk about hiding, what about the label for prop 47 in California. Safe neighborhoods indeed. Let more prisoners out to commit more crimes. What were you hiding from the public?
@SenFeinstein @JudiciaryDems He is already vetted since there are no official qualifications for becoming a Supreme Court justice. The Constitution spells out age, citizenship and residency requirements for becoming President of the United States or a member of Congress but nothing for the Supreme Court.
@CNN Why don't we do that? Oh, wait, the snowflakes might take it as a violent action and run to their safe spaces.
@RealJamesWoods If it is going to be that way then we need to stop spending all federal money there, close all federal offices, go after every illegal alien, no matter status. Bring in federal troops to protect ICE agents during their time in the area.
@joshdcaplan He insisted. If I knew I could insist on something then I would still get paid from jobs I no longer do. Everybody start insisting on what you want. The dems will let you have it. I insist that hillary take a 30 year break from running for any office. How is that for insisting?
@FoxBusiness @Judgenap @USTreasury I am tired of my tax money going to illegals and benefits for those in prison. We need to charge the countries the illegals come from to recoup our expenditures. Prisoners should get less than what the VA gives veterans. We could save money that way.
@HillaryClinton @WeDemandJustice I want power! I want power! I want power! I want power! I want power! I want power! I want power! I want power! I want power! I want power! I want power! I want power! I want power! I want power! I want power! I want power! I want power! That is all she can think about!
@FoxNews maybe they can move his office to the south side?
@10x32 @CBPSouthTexas @DHSgov Read a book.
@SenKamalaHarris She just wants to get her name out and make it LOOK like she cares. She doesn't so don't let it fool you. When is she going to call for an investigation why there are so illegal aliens in our country and what can we do about getting them out of here.
@SenFeinstein Severe case of TDS. need to have the docs give her something to calm her down. What about the collusion between hillary and the Russians?
@Emy32306546 Yes
@LouDobbs Do your houses have fences around them?
@FoxNews Do you think they will partner with the Hallmark channel?
@CNN @Alexandrasking @CNNOpinion How long will the paid maternity leave last? What did we do before that? This is another reason things will cost more. Are the people on fixed income going to get an increase in their monthly amount?
@FoxNews Do you think the people can withhold their taxes from sanctuary cities. They should tax the illegals more to increase the school and health funding's to help the American citizens survive in the new order.
@FoxNews @charliekirk11 Why don't the politician work for free? Because they are greedy. Ask fenstien, she gives her husband heads up before she votes on items that will help him in his real-estate business.
@TheDemocrats Why is it so important to vote. To make sure Trump get re-elected.
@CNN What is going on in Chicago? How there been any results on the war front there. Are we going to get new commanders in the field there? It seems like the head of that city doesn't care about most of the people that live there.
@LouDobbs @gatewaypundit How is he going to make with only 70 Billion to live on?
@FoxNews What is that? turkey is joining the resist movement? Doesn't he know that hillary did not win?
@CNN That is like asking your reporter is they are still dating 12 year olds. There is no correct answer.
@RepAdamSchiff TDS Strikes again: We are a nation of laws. Blame the parents for being separated from their children. American citizens who go to jail get separated from their children. Blame it on the parents, not the laws. Obey our laws or suffer the punishment. Americans are being ignored
@Emy32306546 Have you tired get rid of the addicts? Find out where they are immigrating from and stop that immigration.
@CNN So you did not like the way the White House reprimanded a reporter. I did not like the way I was reprimanded for talking in class in the third grade. get over it whiner. Behave yourself and you will not be reprimanded.
@TheDemocrats @MarcusScribner Don't forget to vote for Trump.
@Hilliard__ Socialism is 5 guys working with 4 of them sitting under a tree and one doing the actual work. All of them get the same pay.
@TheDemocrats Ivan here again, don't forget to vote for Trump.
@UCBerkeley Have you thought about having your antifa members open a bi-partisan day care center? Another thought might be the people on welfare putting in 15 - 20 hours week working in child care and preschool centers.
@CNN They really need to go after the people who litter. I would like to see the litter laws enforced on the highways.
@TheDemocrats Those who yell Russian bot and true comrades.
@TheDemocrats Yes, Trump must win. Vote for Trump.
@TheDemocrats Face it, you don't want to take America back, you want to control it. We are Americans, we are self reliant, we want our freedom, we want to own what we produce &amp; we want everyone to be relying on themselves. I don't want to pay people to sit around &amp; do nothing like politicians!
@corvalues Children; don't forget your parents who are sitting at the front door in the assisted care facilities.
@Woozle_Hunter @dbongino They need to make that trident into a pitch fork. It needs more tines.
@corvalues Bring back the holey board of education.
@Woozle_Hunter @dbongino Don't forget to show her the pictures.
@dbongino Next thing you know she will be covering her ears and going "la la la la..." so she doesn't have to hear what you are saying. What a denier.
@CNN To get the wall paid for start charging a 10% fee for all those money orders that are cashed south of the US Border. Put a charge on all bank transfers that go south of the border also. This will pay for the wall from those countries that are primarily invading our country.
@CNN If there is a government shutdown do not pay back pay. If enough people start yelling about not getting paid then maybe the dems will start down their job for the American people instead of the illegal aliens.
@AMike4761 We need to really watch for "tourist" from the EU maily including Germany. London may be another area to watch with that mayor in charge.
@AMike4761 What happened to freedom of association?
@DailyCaller She knows everything about economics. Yours is hers and hers is only for her.

@GOP @IvankaTrump We could have better opportunities if congress would build the wall and enforce e-verify in the US. There are many jobs that are being taken by illegals that should be going to American citizens. Not just field jobs but other non-labor type jobs.
@HouseDemocrats @RepDanKildee @RepDebDingell TDS - What about American Citizens? Should you be paying as much attention to the American Citizens as you are to the illegal Aliens who are invading our country? We need to build the wall and enforce our borders to protect the American citizens and keep our communities safe.
@MalcolmJenkins Who is the bully? If kneeling were the proper way then you see the  military kneeling during the national anthem. Standing is the proper way  and if your company requires it then do so. If you don't want to then  you have the option of finding another job.
@Hilliard__ Don't feel bad, I only get one follower every two or three months.
@FoxNews Go Vegan? Are those leather shoes you are wearing? Is that a leather purse or wallet? Since you want to go vegan and supporting LGBTQ does that mean LGBTQ members are vegans and vegans are LGBTQ?
@TheDLCC Is the judge going to require that the ballots be available in all languages or just in English and spanish? If not then people who do not speak English or spanish will be disenfranchised.
@plqman The quote is quite correct and it also refers back to the Negro Project of the South which was  plan to rid the south of those that were "unfit." Pleases go back and read the entire letter and reference it back to the people, places and projects they were discussing.
@CalebJHull This straw bearer was also disabled.
@NeilMunroDC Why is the minimum wage for H1-A workers more than $12.00 an hour, but the minimum wage for American workers is less than $8.00 an hour? If anything foreign workers should not be paid more than American workers. It is time to start giving more jobs to Americans.
@plqman Please check out the date and letter referenced.
@RWPUSA @PolitiFactTexas TDS
@AMike4761 Private company. The courts have ruled that it is OK to discriminate based on political affiliation. Unfortunately.
@AMike4761 Send them back and let their homeland take care of them.
@SenWarren @BetsyDeVosED Don't forget the university of california. That is a big for profit school using tax money.
@Patwtweets @RepJoeKennedy @realDonaldTrump No all the children were related to the people that brought them over. Some of the parents elected to leave their children here. Those that reunited were verified before reunification. It is not uncommon for some people to use children as a cover for what they are doing.
@sonofromney @RepJoeKennedy @realDonaldTrump No, but you don't send the children to jail with their parents either. Just like American children they are put up through HHS.
@KatTheHammer1 @NancyPelosi Is her home open to any and all visitors? If someone enters her house without her permission do you think she will call the police? Is her refrigerator well stocked? What about her wet bar? I hope she has an extra bed we can sleep in. When does open house begin?
@RepJoeKennedy @realDonaldTrump Over and over again: We are a nation of laws. Blame the parents for being separated from their children. American citizens who go to jail get separated from their children. Blame it on the parents, not the laws. Obey our laws or suffer the punishment. Americans are being ignored.
@CNN Although regrettable she was still here illegally. She committed a felony when she snuck back in the second time. He may be a former Marine but he has to go through the same process as the rest of the citizens in America. Please read the full story.
@AmyShapiro79 @CNN No, that is not true. You still have to apply for one but you have a better chance. It is not automatic.
@writemombritt Are you kidding, she made me give it up.

@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Again: You demanded an increase in the minimum wage. Did you forget or just  didn't know when you increase the minimum wage everything else  increases. Maybe it is that you just don't care!
@SenSchumer Again: You demanded an increase in the minimum wage. Did you forget or just  didn't know when you increase the minimum wage everything else  increases. Maybe it is that you just don't care!
@SenSchumer @washingtonpost You demanded an increase in the minimum wage. Did you forget or just didn't know when you increase the minimum wage everything else increases. Maybe it is that you just don't care!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump TDS - Hey chuckie, are you going to give those on Social Security a bump in pay while you try to get more money from them? Aren't you the one who wants to spend more instead cutting back? Where is your responsibility in this?
@Divac43459121 Are they going to allow her to babysit their children?
@CNN Russia on the brain syndrome.
@StuartBirdman2 @FoxNews Yep. What caused the odor? I don't think it was Trump.
@CNN Time to strike Coke from my drink list.
@DevinNunes Still more cases of TDS and the Fresno Bee repeating untruths.
@StuartBirdman2 @FoxNews TDS Case. What has this got to do with the odor on Spirit Airlines?
@Smacks2171 @FoxNews Huh?
@tedlieu @united I haven't seen my brothers in at least 15 years; do I get a free flight? No, I am a citizen &amp; did not commit any illegal act. United stock holders ought to be up in arms about giving away free flights to illegal aliens. The parents committed crimes and need to leave country.
@USAHotLips TDS
@TheRealBuzz I think we need to start with steps, space station, moon base then Mars. Launching an expedition from the moon or a space station will be much better than just going straight to Mars. Need to work out the bugs before going there and a moon base will help get that done.
@real_jamielshaw How many of their employees are illegal? If we don't know who they are how can they get jobs working on or with airplanes. We don't know their background it. They be setting the airlines up for drug/human trafficking. We just don't know. We need to stop the invaders.
@SenateDems Nation of Laws First: Blame the parents for being separated from their children. American citizens who go to jail get separated from their children. Blame it on the parents, not the laws. Obey our laws or suffer the punishment. Simple.
@CNN Why do they get free WiFi, they seem to have all our money held in escrow. Check your email for the notifications.
@KamalaHarris @clairecmc So what? I get targeted every day by phishing emails and Nigerian bankers that have millions of dollars for me. What are you going to do about them?
@JebBush Mitch who?
@CNN I think my Hyundai is a better deal.
@LucasRAcosta Now imagine how obese people feel.
@NancyPelosi No it won't, but you do. America First!
@campusreform Why is it she still working in Fresno? Transfer her to Seattle where she will be welcomed.
@SenKamalaHarris Kamala, please help us. Resign and get someone better in your position.
@RealSaavedra I wonder if he is swapping spit with maxine waters?
@SenSchumer there can a million indictments which don't mean a thing until there are convictions.
@SenatorMenendez indited but not convicted. Indictments are not convictions except in the mid of the dems. So let us all indite bob menendez and the numerous counts of dereliction of duty.
@RepLoisFrankel @realDonaldTrump Again: Blame the parents for being separated from their children. American citizens who go to jail get separated from their children. Blame it on the parents, not the laws. Obey our laws or suffer the punishment. Simple.

@jojoh888 Should have started with his parents. He can help by not having any of his own.
@SenGillibrand What about the obese, shouldn't they be allowed to be in the military? They can do some jobs just as well as others.
@AlexPadilla4CA Are you going to make sure only AMERICAN Citizen are voting? Don't care about prepaid postage, but do care about who is voting in OUR elections. Don't want any meddlers, only US Citizens! No pretend citizens!
@ballotpedia It is not unprecedented to revoke citizenship of a naturalized person. We need to tighten up our procedures and try to prevent such things. We do however need the ability to revoke. It gives us one more thing to prevent crimes in America.
@FoxNews @RepMaxineWaters @realDonaldTrump Which God?
@DeptofDefense @usairforce A lot different than when I went through NBC Training in the 70's.
@AGBecerra @CaliforniaLabor @IBEW You are calling an independent electrician?
@ShamTrumpy @RepGutierrez Tears of joy?
@ShamTrumpy @RepGutierrez Love it. Straight to yelling and demands. No discussions https://t.co/2XmksNOdGb far as lying look it up and you will find that in 1997 clinton was taken to court over this same thing. obama also had the same practice of not sending the children to jail.
I hope the asylum seeker was worth it. ⚡️ “Swedish student stops deportation of asylum seeker to Afghanistan”		https://t.co/MRPgv1huX9
I want wider seats with more leg room. That doesn't seem to be happening either. ⚡️ “Dua Lipa unimpressed with airline over nut allergy response”		https://t.co/AtaaS9FWd4
@ShamTrumpy @RepGutierrez This has been going for quite a while. clinton and obama did the same  thing, so they must have been unAmerican also. Those coming across  illegally think they don't have to abide by our laws, sorry but they do.
@marina__9876 @FoxNews @dannydanon Try to learn from the past. Those who don't learn from the past are bound to repeat the same mistakes.
@BillOReilly It has been a long time where the conservatives had just stood back and taken it on the chin. It is refreshing to see someone dishing it out for a change. I am tired of hearing it can’t be done. Let’s get it done.
@zippity12 @marina__9876 @FoxNews @dannydanon How true.
@IngrahamAngle They came with their children, they leave with their children. I would love to have my grandchildren with me but if their parents brought them here and left them it would be illegal. Currently the parents are on a 12 year waiting list to come here legally.
@stevenj0330 I still say, close more colleges and open more trade schools.
@Rockprincess818 @TheDemocrats Too bad we don't have places where they can turn big rocks into little rocks anymore.
@FoxNews Do they know who the father is? Don't tell planned parenthood! We need more giraffes.
@NancyPelosi Why don't you go back to CA and tell them to stop raising all sorts of different taxes, fees and etc...The people on fixed incomes are not getting the same increase in money that the law makers are giving themselves. Stop giving our tax money to illegals!
@RepGutierrez Over and over again: Blame the parents for being separated from their children. American citizens who go to jail get separated from their children. Blame it on the parents, not the laws. Obey our laws or suffer the punishment. Simple. We are not the bad guys, it is our country
@RepMarkMeadows When are they going to be locked up?
@RepSwalwell Before you vote make sure you are an American citizen.
@FoxNews @dannydanon Nothing has changed is Iran since 1979. Why don't people want to learn from the past and not commit the same mistakes?
@marina__9876 @FoxNews @dannydanon Remember 1979 and carter. Who is the bad actor from then?
@FoxNews @dannydanon I remember 1979, why doesn't the news rooms?
@mightyronster @FoxNews @dannydanon Don't forget obama and his crew.
@RepYvetteClarke Again: Blame the parents for being separated from their children. American citizens who go to jail get separated from their children. Blame it on the parents, not the laws. Obey our laws or suffer the punishment. Simple.

@FoxNews @BryanLlenas Of course, news claims he had mental issues. We now know what those mental issues were.
@CNN Let see if you can keep your word about there should be no violence. Next time invite someone over who wears a MAGA hat and see what your good people do them. Remember your words.
@CNN Did the attacker have green hair?
@chuckwoolery I think now jim davis must be a pedophile for drawing this kind of stuff. Are they have him register along with justin roiland? Time to take rick and morty off the air.
@FoxNews @SenJohnKennedy Yes, you can butt-head? Security clearances are a privilege and revocable at any time and for any reason. The main reason for a clearance is for the need to know and they no longer have the need to know and if you don't need to know then neither should you.
@KamalaHarris No, tired of all the relief acts. Cut taxes and have congress spend less on things we don't need such as bridges to nowhere.
@RepSteveStivers @FinancialCmte Lets start with the American first! The Thai soccer team members are not homeless. Migrant children are separated because of the actions of their parents. If you are going to spend our money spend it in America.
@CNN Attacks have been going on for quite awhile now, but BART will not release to the public the videos of the attacks. Is there any particular reason they won't? The public needs to be informed of what is going on and what to be watching for to avoid these attacks if possible.
@CNN Stop with crap, Migrant - Ha! Illegal is more like it. CNN start telling the truth - No More FAKE NEWS. People have friends and family trying to get here the legal way and they are waiting lists that run years. So someone who trys to sneak in gets caught - Big Deal!
@FoxNews The cupcakes can't handle it.
@knowYourRole42 @FoxNews What is racist about a "Bro"
@SenFeinstein Can you release your records and the records of your husband's business deals?
@HigherHeights @BarackObama Have you tried Prozac?
@ACTBrigitte I have a 4 year granddaughter who can do the no bit better than that. But he has that whiner look down pat. I think we have found his job, professional whiner. Now we need to find someone who will pay him. Are you listening maxine?
@ErinFlora5 Welcome, and remember not all the people are bad. Have a nice day.
@FoxNews They should have got them there then blocked their cell phones and internet. There would be such a cry that there would be no unoccupied cry/safe room within 500 miles.
@CNN Then hillary must be in love with putin and worships at his feet daily after her reset with him and the gift of uranium she gave him.
@BestForJuicing @rektredpill No worse than Monica's cigars.
@SenGillibrand Where does it say you can enter the country any way you want. It does say send but it never says we have to accept.

@DHSgov Please check out: Lloyd @L___LOYD
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Ted lie is back at it again. Shouldn't he be working for the American citizens instead of trying defending those who are trying to being down the duly elected government?
@FoxNews Sometimes people just do nice things and those who cannot believe just see depravity behind it. Look for the good. Also when you get a chance watch Live PD.
@bostonsbetter2 @FoxNews Definitely not in the Buddhist way of teaching.
@jasoninthehouse Chef of the day
@FoxNews R-word, rerun, related, ruddy, ruthless, rugrat, restless, reckless, rowdy or what?
@KamalaHarris Is it for American citizens only?
@linn_leblanc @TheRealBuzz @NASAWatch Who is the pilot?
@JNP63 @FoxNews @kayleighmcenany There is a push to make it a felony. What is a felony is identity theft. If they are using the SSAN of another person then it is a felony. If they sign up to work with a fraudulent SSAN that is fraud.
@KcCliff @FoxNews @Ocasio2018 You started with the wrong people. Start with the politician first. They need divest themselves of ALL the money and property to fund the socialist system they want. We can make dormitories to live in and eat a cafeteria. When they get sick they can go to sick call.
@tedlieu @RepJerryNadler @realDonaldTrump Why didn't you complain about this when obama was in charge, or did you approve of it? If so, why not now? You talk about lying, why do you lie when you say it is a Trump policy? It is not, it was started under clinton. Blame him and the parents of the children.
@tedlieu @RepJerryNadler @realDonaldTrump Again: Blame the parents for being separated from their children. American citizens who go to jail get separated from their children. Blame it on the parents, not the laws. Obey our laws or suffer the punishment. Simple.
@FoxNews @AlanDersh @POTUS You mean to tell me that the special counsel is not interested in the truth?
@VP @POTUS It seems like the dems think that your money is their money to give away to those who did nothing to earn it. It is the God given right AND duty for every American to pay the LEAST taxes that is allowed. We should not give the government more to spend. Learn to spend less.
@squattchie seems like the power may be going to her head already.
@Acosta Wow, you can quote a poem. Did not know you had it in you.
@KamalaHarris How can you say you represent the military when you want socialism? Many of the men and women in the military want to be treated fairly and know that their sacrifices mean something. They want to keep the American way &amp; traditions alive and in-tacked. Socialism does not do that.
@FoxNews The suit that challenged the proposition was filed by an environmental group, The Planning and Conservation League. Check them out. They are afraid the breakup will not let them get their agenda through because they will have to try to convince different people.
@VeronicaCrawfo1 @FoxNews You didn't read the whole referendum. It just started the process. It did not complete it.
@Vote_American @FoxNews I am not sure you meant circumcised, did you mean castrated?
@FoxNews How much did he give to planned parenthood?
@FoxNews @SenWarren Get rid of the illegal aliens and more jobs will open up. Some of them even high paying like lawyers, government officials (in California). It is also time for elizabeth warren to give up her day job and someone more qualified to do it, even if they are not of Indian Heritage.
@foxandfriends What does she know about the real Alaska?
@FoxNews @MickMulvaneyOMB @AmericaNewsroom We need companies to invest in the future of America, not through taxes, but by helping with trade schools. The schools should be for only for those who are here legally. I am tired of paying for those who do not obey the laws.
@RWPUSA @CNNPolitics Your bio says "Professor of law." Is that true item or did you make it up. The President - What happened to "innocent until proven guilty?" Where is your proof? If it is words then maybe you turn yourself in for sedition to the US. American people need facts, not just rhetoric.
@RealCandaceO @TheView @MeghanMcCain @JudgeJeanine Who are the sponsors of this show? Shouldn't we let them know how we feel since they are providing the money to keep the show on the air.
@SenKamalaHarris Is this for American citizens or for anybody who decides to come here legally or illegally?
@potato13216 @TheDemocrats @KatherineClark Tell that to the American citizens being incarcerated on just charges. Also isn't Trump innocent, he hasn't been found guilty of anything, well...other than enforcing the laws that were on the books.
@chuckwoolery How much is her kick back, being the her "heritage" is native American, as we all "know."
@Dreambout45 A brat? Glad to meet you. I am Vietnam vet and Air Force Overseas brat. Long live the brats!
@BreakingNLive The real question is can the German people rely on Angela Merkel?
@chuckwoolery This really must be "spontaneous" otherwise who carries around a bottle of lighter fluid?
@chuckwoolery What makes it even worse is that the stole the flag off of a truck to burn it. They could have at least spent their own money on it.
@NewDay @RepSwalwell In that case build the wall and we stop others from invading our country also.
@FoxNews The suit that challenged the proposition was filed by an environmental group, The Planning and Conservation League. Check them out. They are afraid the breakup will not let them get their agenda through because they will have to try to convince different people.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump How well do you speak Russian?
@FoxNews @cvpayne Let's close some of the colleges and open more trade schools. Have companies that are looking for workers sponsor the trade school. All I see at the colleges is that they are getting indoctrinated and not trained for jobs.
@TerrellShaun Are you rowing the boat on the river Styx? How much are you charging and do you report it to the IRS?
@FoxNews If it were an illegals cafe then they would be doing brisk business.
@SenSanders When are you going to the American people ahead of illegal aliens?

@MR_DRD32 @OfficialLivePD @Sean_C_Larkin Doubt it, since they have to download the video for the Officer's camera. Granted some may have the capability to upload live but it has to be held for a bit before letting it out to public. There may be some info on it where they would not want to taint a jury.
@FoxNews @JessicaTarlov @JoeBiden Being a politician just means you can talk and schmooze your way around. I admit it may be hard work to constantly look at yourself in the mirror and practice speeches. Most of their job is glad handling their supporters without actually working for them.
@LincolnFresno @NancyPelosi When is Nancy going to do her job?  I would really appreciate it if she would start working for the American citizens instead of complaining how bad the illegals have it. They brought it upon themselves when they decided they don't have to abide by out laws while in our country.
@CNN let's see the video tape of the interviews done with the people. Have a verified interpreter available, not one that puts the wrong interpretation overlaid like CNN has done before. Ask them why the chose to come in illegally instead of the correct way.
RT @charliekirk11: Illegals should not be counted in the US census. This isn't controversial, this shouldn't even be up for discussion. 		I…
@RealCandaceO @Ocasio2018 Does cortez have a job yet?
@RieneRichard @potato13216 @TheDemocrats @KatherineClark I agree with you. Somewhere in the UN stuff it says that asylum seekers should request asylum in neighboring countries. I am trying to find those instructions again.
@allinwithchris @RepJoeKennedy We have the right to know what mueller has found so far and why strzok has such a smirky smile.
@CNN It is about time, there needs to be a big shake up. Everybody tries blaming the absolute top but that is not always where the problems lie. There are many lower down that can cause havoc and they should be removed if they are not doing their best and working to better the VA.
@CNN @CNNOpinion Have everyone re-register demanding proof of citizenship and real ID.
@KamalaHarris What is the prison's name? Where is it located? Is it in the US? Who is funding it? How long have you known about this? Is congress doing anything about it? What is your involvement in this prison system? What are their charges? Where are You?! Hopefully not in front of a camera.
@NancyPelosi @EmCollective Again: Blame the parents for being separated from their children. American citizens who go to jail get separated from their children. Blame it on the parents, not the laws. Obey our laws or suffer the punishment. Simple.
@potato13216 @TheDemocrats @KatherineClark It is not the asylum seeking itself but it is the illegal entry into the country where the parents are separated from the children because of the parents being a jail setting.
@potato13216 @TheDemocrats @KatherineClark Doesn't seem a tad extreme to let anybody break laws without consequences? In the US  kids are separated from their parents when the parents go to jail. Shouldn't illegal aliens get the same treatment as a US Citizen?
@potato13216 @TheDemocrats @KatherineClark I know you are going but she is seeking asylum from some situation. She still needs to do it legally. Not because she wants to. That is our law and if they want to come here then they need to abide by our laws.
@potato13216 @TheDemocrats @KatherineClark Anybody wanting to come here legally including the saylum seekers must come through the legal ports of entry not just anywhere they want to. The who do not have some reason they don't want to do it legally. We need to make sure that they are not problems for our country.
@CNN Stop having movies feature places in San Francisco. Then maybe people will stop.
@TheDemocrats @KatherineClark Did they cross legally?
@dianne81659302 @SenMarkey @RepJoeKennedy Then what about shaming those who take drugs and drink. Shouldn't they be shamed? We try to help them with needle exchange programs, safe shoot up sites. Aren't they causing a detrimental effect on their health and costly to services and sometimes even taking others lives?
@dianne81659302 @SenMarkey @RepJoeKennedy Thyroid conditions, hereditary, and the pursuit of happiness are some reasons. Some of it is choice but not all, so what gives others the right to shame someone because of their size, even to the point of not letting them have jobs that they can do.
@SenMarkey @RepJoeKennedy When are they going to make fat shaming a panic defense? where is the equality?
@Hizo2737 @FoxNews @marcorubio Well at least we agree on one thing, have a nice day.
@Hizo2737 @FoxNews @marcorubio Yes, you are right, but I still wish he could been in front of the American people.
@FoxNews @marcorubio Why didn't obama have that speech in the US? Why is he preaching that in another country?
@CNN Who ever thought that negotiations would take place overnight. Get real   negotiations between countries sometimes take years. Please be patient   and get right the first time instead of pulling another Iran type deal. Dark of the night money giveaways, 2500 made citizens. &amp; more
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump NOTE: He said "Some People" not just Americans. Your statement makes it appear that he was saying all Americans have TDS. It is just some people. I think you may need to include yourself in that group. You have been displaying all the symptoms of TDS. Please seek help.
@FoxNews @marcorubio If Putin is a liar like everybody (the dems) are saying then when he said he wanted Trump to win, is that a lie or not? If the whole goal was to cause controversy then why are the dems helping him out instead of rallying behind Trump for a strong front? End the controversy.
@CNNPolitics Yeah, like we can get to the truth - Strzok?
@CNN And?
RT @JoanneTirado09: yes!!!	🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸	👇👇👇👇 https://t.co/JLdSHE8P6Y
@bikenandhiken @Hammerfer @junebugg61 @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump I still want to know who is coming into the country.
@PizzaCat411 @bikenandhiken @Hammerfer @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump The ones that come across illegally (not at the authorized entry ports) are criminals. The zero tolerance policy has them being arrested and the parents are put into jails and the children are being handled by various agencies. Still not a bot but, do know how to copy and paste.
@jhund60 @bikenandhiken @Hammerfer @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Stop what? Trying to people to follow the laws? Wanting to know who is coming into the country?
@kentwalker84 Oh, wait a minute you live in Canada. What do you have to worry about?
@kentwalker84 When you don't like the laws you start yelling Nazi, Racist, Fascist and other such things. It just says you do not believe in the laws. If you don't then try to get them changed. Where is your compassion and empathy  for those who try to obey our laws? straight to name calling?
@olivia_pohl @bikenandhiken @Hammerfer @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump It is not their fault for the back log but they could at least try to abide by our laws.
@alliegata @bikenandhiken @Hammerfer @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Not a bot
@DarrellIssa @realDonaldTrump What kind of information does strzok have on some of the members of Congress that lets him have that smug smile? He must have something that gives him a get out jail free card. Look closely and watch who is defending him.
@AnnCoulter It is amazing when the dnc yells about the "hacking" but they say that the info put out there was untrue. The password used was given to the hackers through a phishing scheme. Is the info true or not true. Did the dnc's top people scheme to get sanders out of the way?
@FoxNews jane "The Traitor" fonda, go ahead and go back to Vietnam.
@bikenandhiken @medwoman1 @Hammerfer @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump The families that were separated did not come in at legal ports of entry. Those that were separated were because the parents were arrested for illegal entry . You don't send the children to jail with the parents when they arrested. That is the same for American citizens.
@FaithMKarimi Please go out do some research on the military family, especially overseas brats.
@FaithMKarimi I read your article but was bewildered about the comment about the races. The military families grew up together and played together. I was born into a military family and there were all races and types of people around. It was just common back then. 50', 60's and 70's.
@gingerland62 @pharmabeatmkr @NancyPelosi why did obama ignore Russia's meddling, was he letting them do it? so Trump isn't the only one to be hoodwinked by putin.
@pharmabeatmkr @NancyPelosi Don’t forget caught on open mic - President Obama to Russian President Medvedev (Seoul, South Korea, Mar 27, 2012): "This is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility." Reply: “I understand you. I transmit this information to Vladimir, and I stand with you.”
@NancyPelosi Purveyor of fake News
@medwoman1 @bikenandhiken @Hammerfer @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump What makes them so special that they cannot come in the right way like many of the others? Is there something in their background that excludes them? They need to it the correct way. We need to know their background, health and circumstances. Do it legally like many before them.
@chuckwoolery Has anybody found out what union these people belong to? Do they get shift pay for nighttime protests?
@bikenandhiken @Hammerfer @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Again: Blame the parents for being separated from their children. American citizens who go to jail get separated from their children. Blame it on the parents, not the laws. Obey our laws or suffer the punishment. Simple.
@EEWintertide @SenGillibrand You are right, the deplorable are correct.
@SenGillibrand Well, at least he's better than a left-wing nominee. Go more right-wing.
@CNN They are probably going to charge more for recycled saying they are saving the planet. It should be cheaper since they are selling used stuff.
@seanhannity She does, Russia. Ask her husband. Oh yes, don't forget her uranium deal that she gave them.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP And you think obama defended the US? No way, he blamed the US for all the ills in the world. The cold was with Russia (USSR) has been around since before you were born. Anytime we can talk it is better than fighting. I know, do you?
@WaldorickWilson @SenSanders @AFTunion The people are paying the corporate taxes. Companies need to make a profit on their products to pay employees &amp; such, so they charge higher prices. If the government taxes them more then they charge higher prices so we are still paying more taxes. Government will soon own it all.
@RepAdamSchiff Don't forget about obama ignoring the Russian meddling.
@SenSanders @AFTunion You still have not said how these things will be paid for. Are the professor going to teach free? Can we go back to the old days of the schoolmarm and give free board and lodging instead of pay? I do not want to pay for others to go to college and learn how to hate.
@CNN Has anyone considered the pilots may not trust the air traffic controllers now due to the diversity program. We need qualified ATC not ones who fill a color block. Do you want the best advising the plane or just someone who looks a certain way? Look up FAA ATC diversity program.
@SenSchumer Well chuckie, it is time to get the boys to take basic survival swimming lessons.
@Breaking911 Please take them straight to feinsteins abode.
@CNN @CNNOpinion You should pay Trump so you can Fake News to write about.
@KamalaHarris How can you look in a mirror when you duped so many CA citizens with that bogus title for prop 47?
@JxhnBinder Send him to live with Gov brown
@DRUDGE_REPORT I still wonder how much info he has to hold over the heads of the many dems that defended him during the "hearings?" I also wonder whether he had that same smug look when he told his wife he had to work late?
@FoxNews The supreme court decision has nothing to do with ending funding for public schools. All it did was give the worker the right to decide whether they wanted to pay money to someone who doesn't have their best interest at heart.
@KamalaHarris Again: Blame the parents for being separated from their children. American citizens who go to jail get separated from their children. Blame it on the parents, not the laws. Obey our laws or suffer the punishment. Simple.
@_ReaalAmerican_ @sioxielegend @redsteeze Which country?
@SenSanders How much do you make? Are all your people paid or are some of them volunteers? Why don't you pay everybody a living wage? Actually they don't need to explain anything. People go to work where they want, they are not forced to work in jobs they don't like. Personal responsibility!
@CNN why didn't rep adam shifty complain about obama meeting with Russian President.
@AMike4761 Trump, watch out for a push on sharia laws.
@charliekirk11 He was in on it.   Caught on open mic - President Obama to Russian President Medvedev (Seoul, South Korea, 3/27/12): "This is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility." Reply: “I understand you. I transmit this information to Vladimir, and I stand with you.”
@AMike4761 Watch out for a push of sharia laws.
@wa_chipen @FoxNews While I agree with you about the Royal Family. it has so far been Meghan Markle's family no her. Somehow I think there are sour grapes there.
@AMike4761 He has the right to run or not to run, preferably. He also has the right to leave England, which he should do.
@KamalaHarris But it is okay for you to meet with socialist.
@CNN It would help a lot if people would not use password as their password. Common sense is taking a vacation when protecting our secrets. If you don't want info out for the world to view use COMSEC
@FoxNews @AlanDersh All those dems that don't like should join all the actors that fled the country after Trump was elected. Oh, wait a minute, they are still here, darn.
On extermination of blacks: "We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population," she said, "if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members." 12/10/1939 letter from Mrs. Sanger to Mr. Gamble.  Margaret Sanger, Founder of Planned Parenthood.
@CNN what is wework?
@SenFeinstein Apply legally.
