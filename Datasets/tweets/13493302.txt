@Harry1T6 we're referring to hyperbole from people like you who refuse to show the slightest bit of empathy towards people who get abortion, but sure, continue the bad faith charade.
@Harry1T6 can you read? because the statement you're quoting clearly answers that
Let's be clear: It would be a lot easier to study later abortions if people weren't made to feel like garbage for seeking them. 		And they feel like garbage because these right-wing ideologues who think they know more than doctors will use any opportunity to attack them.
For more: https://t.co/PqG0b1UKaV
Did you not notice this quote from the study?		"Our study has several important limitations. Our data are limited by the exclusion of women who sought later abortions on grounds of fetal anomaly or life endangerment. "
Finally, this study *explicitly* says it's hard to study who gets later abortions and why and so that study looks explicitly at: "analyzing data on women who sought and received an abortion at or after 20 weeks’ gestation for reasons other than fetal anomaly or life endangerment"
You identified (without meaning to, likely) that these anti-choice laws impose financial and logistical barriers on abortion access. That can sometimes push people into needing second trimester abortions -- which are still distinct from what the NY law talks about.
Nope you're mistaken, sorry.		This study is from 2013, and is talking about later abortions as at 20 weeks or later -- the NY law was talking about restrictions after 24 weeks. The law is based on people's repeated testimonies involve wanted/medically necessary abortions https://t.co/334fQaxwAy
Right-wing media are again trying to hijack a news cycle based on faux outrage. Polling clearly shows most people wants access to abortion care to remain between a patient and their doctor. And based on the amount of bad faith reactions on display today, it’s not hard to see why.
If these pundits actually *listened* to those who have had these procedures, it would be clear that this isn’t something people are doing just for the hell of it. Suggesting otherwise is stigmatizing and wrong.  https://t.co/Quv94yDmmE
Right-wing media’s outcry today about “infanticide” / 'abortions ‘till birth' is both inaccurate and cruel. 		People don’t have later abortions recreationally -- they are rare and used when a pregnancy is nonviable or risks the person’s life.
