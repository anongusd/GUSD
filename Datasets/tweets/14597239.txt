@MikeIsaac @MattRosoff this is totally the case in vertical deals. the ftc should look every damn year at the market post amazon-whole foods. that merger skated through. the agency and public deserves some more constant oversight/econ analysis		and yes re: slam dunks
@MikeIsaac @MattRosoff ... the retrospective on a merger doesn't have to end in legal action. the ftc could just conclude to handle future mergers of the same type differently. and in terms of studying past work to see how it fared, this makes total sense. it should def know what happened.
@MikeIsaac @MattRosoff at the end of the day, to do something like take apart a company, they'd have to be able to go to court and prove that it had violated federal antitrust law. that is hard. and i do not see the agency doing this unless they had a clear win, with or without task force. but...
@MikeIsaac @MattRosoff i mean it would be epic if they concluded "actually we done wrong" and then tried to fix it. the FTC made clear today that technically they had the remedies at their disposal to do such a thing if they could meet the legal standard or proof but.....
@mims hugcoin
In the case the FTC does do a retrospective merger review, agency clarifies it has "the full panoply of remedies available to us" -- which could include breaking companies up or spinning off pieces to fix competition. Gotta meet legal standard, including in court
there is no reason for the FTC not to talk more openly about its work. this is a choice they make. just a reminder here.
also yes for those curious I am absolutely losing my voice because some of us can't have a gin and tonic at a loud bar anymore without having no voice for days after

lastly, story updated with:		--comments from Congress, where demand for high fine is, well, high		--comments from privacy experts who say this is a big test for the agency, but FB stands to take a huge PR hit if it went to court https://t.co/KkEregTsha
i have never heard anyone speak about criminal penalties. but one thing we didn't get into here, but will eventually address, is our previous reporting that shows FTC held many of its meetings with folks from DOJ and SEC in the room. i think this only scratches the surface. https://t.co/PGgXlGZPGk
@tsgiles hahaha that's what all the men say to me
Just spoke w/Sen Blumenthal, who told me: “Facebook faces a moment of reckoning and the only way it will come is through an FTC order with severe penalties and other sanctions that stop this kind of privacy misconduct going forward." https://t.co/KkEregTsha
READ IT https://t.co/r1NQ43g1Bf
@nicktheandersen shant
also that BUT remember two things:		a) there's the fine, and then there's the potential losses incurred on the market as a result of the fine, albeit that's prob temporary and		b) the order will demand much more from FB https://t.co/Wul3QS77gp
this is a great point -- the AGs are also actively probing this and one area i'm still learning about https://t.co/zIgi8ceRol
this is disgusting https://t.co/TWuXU9cGta
@lexnfx @crampell with a B and possibly an S at the end.
this is the reality -- these penalties you see for order violations often are settlements. reflection of the fact the agency is limited in what it can litigate by its resources and bandwidth, among other things.		if you want a more active FTC, you gotta fund/staff/empower it https://t.co/w9D1LWbrE0
My story also touches on this -- but I'll emphasize here further -- that the fine is just the beginning. We're talking a new order with new conditions, for example. So think of this as the beginning of the story, not the end. https://t.co/KkEregTsha
I can't stress enough that things are very fluid right now but we're closer to a resolution than perhaps some people thought. And there's a world in which this fine is too large for Facebook to accept and the FTC has to decide whether it's willing to litigate https://t.co/KkEregTsha
SCOOP: The FTC is actively negotiating w/Facebook and could force it to pay a multi-billion dollar fine to settle privacy investigation, sources tell me. As I told you in January, this would be a record if things proceed this way. Could go to court. https://t.co/VkQQ2ff9Bz

it's not that this game is low scoring. it's that this season has been defined by high octane offenses that break the scoreboard, so it's not even a reflection of what got a team like the rams here in the first place.
that was a needlessly dramatic field goal in the third quarter of what is now a 3-3 game		where are the saints where are the chiefs where are the eagles lol

@CaseyNewton @KurtWagner8 this is partly true. the reality is the agency could do more, but for reasons related to politics sometimes and law other times, it often does not. but it is the best the us has rn so it warrants the attention, even if its primary function is to illustrate its inadequacy
@KurtWagner8 not one. and criminally few questions about privacy. this FTC fine could be 'spensive. either investors/analysts under-appreciate the regulatory risks to the bottom-line or just actually don't think the government stuff matters, which is wrong imo but i am a plebe
