The idea of requiring a fee on @USMSPB filings is counterproductive and unamerican. If the Board needs more resources to hear whistleblower claims, Congress should appropriate them.
Thanks to @GerryConnolly for acknowledging that prolonged vacancies, particularly at the @USMSPB is not a Democrat or republican issue, it‚Äôs a good government issue.
.@GovAcctProj‚Äôs Tom Devine- scrambling by @US_OSC to make up for an absent @USMSPB is no substitute for statutory authority.
Happening now: House oversight hearing on MSPB vacancies ‚Äî on the only member‚Äôs last day in office. Tomorrow, the board will be vacant and the 2000+ backlog will continue to grow. #justicedenied
The House passed bipartisan HR 1235 last night, taking a major step toward preserving the sole MSPB member for one year. Big thanks to @GerryConnolly for standing up for whistleblower rights on the House floor and to @RepCummings for his quick leadership! https://t.co/POtbp3PW1p
.@demandprogress's First Branch Forecast was particularly helpful and delightfully snarky today. Snaps for @amelia_strauss and @danielschuman for putting this together every week! ((R-Downton Abbey) got an actual lol out of me on a Monday morning)) --&gt; https://t.co/u64VmnkPYM
(4/4) It's great that Congress was able to step in and perform their oversight function which they should do as often as possible... but this needs a permanent solution--an agency head removing their own IG should never be an option on the table. #AskMeAboutTheVacanciesAct
(3/4) Turns out, Congress! Snaps for @SenGaryPeters, @RepCummings, @BobbyScott, @rosadelauro, and @PattyMurray for their letter to @BetsyDeVosED this week asking why she tried to remove the @EducationOIG when they refused to drop their investigations into @usedgov's shadiness
(2/4) Acting IGs don't benefit from the independence protections that permanent IGs do. So, who will step in when an agency head tries to weasel out of an IG investigation by REMOVING THEIR OWN WATCHDOG (Other than @POGOBlog?!)
(1/4) Here's perfect example of why we need permanent IGs AND Vacancies Act reforms-- a thread you didn't ask for in 4 parts! https://t.co/arcgswnr2A

The President just said he "thinks" he'll win on a Constitutional challenge. Shouldn't Constitutional compliance be the first priority of the US President? Wouldn't you make sure you were acting Constitutionally before pulling $8bn from military projects? I sure would.
Without legitimate access to justice, we're asking workers to risk everything to protect us with no reciprocal promise to protect them. This needs to be a higher priority for everyone before the board shuts down in 2 weeks. GET IT TOGETHER, PEOPLE! https://t.co/mCasYOEI6q
If we aren't willing to re-empower the @USMSPB as an efficient, effective, and ethical upholder of the federal merit system principles, we need to give whistleblowers an alternative option for an expeditious fair day in court through access to federal jury trials and stays...
MSPB hasn't had quorum for 2 years, so agencies who retaliate against whistleblowers and lose their cases in front of Administrative Judges have been filing appeals to an absent board, knowing that they will escape an adverse ruling for YEARS. There are already 2000+ cases...
With all the drama surrounding @USMSPB, remember who is really hurt in the end: whistleblowers and, by proxy, everyone who relies on their disclosures. That includes literally everyone who expects clean water to drink, air to breathe, and food to eat...is that you? Read on:
.@HSGAC didn‚Äôt take up the question of extending the lone @USMSPB board member for another year. But unless quorum is restored by March 1, whistleblowers won‚Äôt be able to have stays issued when they‚Äôre retaliated against. Maybe we should giving this power to @US_OSC for now?
Even though the @USMSPB has lacked quorum for 2 years, the senate must do due dilligence in vetting Mr. Kirk‚Äôs conflicts before confirming him for a 7 year position that affords him major authority over whistleblowers
.@usmspb nominees Dennis Kirk and Julia Clark just voted out of @HSGAC with Sen Paul being the sole vote against despite major concerns lingering about Mr. Kirk
