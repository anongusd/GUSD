Hypothetically, if you would rather see Trump win than Bernie, you're not part of the resistance, you're part of the Trump re-election committee.
@SusannaMatte @thomaskaine5 Lol. You mean the magical thinking that is now ironically the 2020 Democratic platform? That magical thinking? He's already won. His views are now accepted by the majority of Dems. He's saved the Democratic Party.
@VictoriaVanHor7 @SSGRet110706 @ADIC33 M4A, climate change, Political finance reform, wealth taxes.
@shossy2 @Nicoxw1 But 90% of them threw their support to Clinton and rightfully so. This whole blaming Bernie for having a small faction of idiots in his following is unfair. I've met some pretty identical Clinton die-hards today that said "I would rather vote Trump than Sanders".
@DJVinTO @ADIC33 You can't take away votes from Dems if you're voting for Dems. Can he beat Trump? I doubt it. Especially with the "Clintonista Never Bernie" faction acting they did with Obama. At least Bernie voters threw support to Clinton in droves. Im voting Blue no matter who though.
@KuluRoux @ADIC33 He did run a complete presidential campaign not taking corporate PAC money. But yeah, he's old.
@VictoriaVanHor7 @SSGRet110706 @ADIC33 Is that why the 2020 Dem platform is completely the same as his? Just asking.
@UncleBlueWave @sheryl_monk @lisastark351 So because of the few you punish the many? That seems highly personal more than its logical. But hey it SL your vote. If you'd rather have Trump than Bernie, you might be a Republican.

@WAV_nvdr @kim @tricia2886 @BetoORourke There are some benefits to Capitalism. I personally believe in Democratic Socialism and am happy to see us make that a reality. Dinner or later.
@WAV_nvdr @kim @tricia2886 @BetoORourke She's a solution to Trump. She may not be a solution to the immediate advancement of the more progressive leaning agenda but let's take it step by step. Progress is a roller coaster. We have to stay on the ride for the parts we don't like sometimes to get to the end.
@kim @WAV_nvdr @tricia2886 @BetoORourke That makes two of us. Prior to her nomination for Speaker I was even on the fence but her ability to seemingly out maneuver Trump so far has me in awe. Her skills have been on full display and I'm loving it. I think she would stand the best chance of any known candidate so far.
@WAV_nvdr @tricia2886 @kim @BetoORourke Honestly I don't 100% love any Dem candidate unless Pelosi announce her running. If not, I'll settle for 75%.
@Tennesseine @Defeat_Trump2 @NerdyInNOLA There is that same level of nonsensical behavior coming from the die hard Clintonista camp. There are some bad progressives. There are bad Dems.

@blechtimes @BravenakBlog Combat the far left? You do realize we're fighting for the same side? If Dems aren't lefties, I'm finding new candidates to vote for this Novemeber. Thanks to your insight of what it means to be a Dem.
@BravenakBlog @cfaybeard Actually you're incorrect. Obama is a former politician. So Bernie still wins that title. But I'll be happy to vote for whoever wins the Dem ticket. Even if it's the worst candidate in history. Let's tone down the divisive rhetoric though so we can focus on the bigger picture.

I would agree, Mr. Senator. Your diligence is highly appreciated. And regardless of the cynicism, I know even as an Independent, you've helped create the new progressive Democratic platform that I believe in and support so strongly. Thank you, sir! https://t.co/HA8ekcji6p
@GOP @realDonaldTrump One liar nominating another liar? Hmmmm. And coupled with a complicit GOP? He's definitely getting confirmed. I won't be surprised however if he also gets removed in utter shame for his deceitful ways. Time will tell. And it's saying "tick tock" for Kavanaugh...and Trump.

Bernie lost. Get over it! Clinton lost. Get over it. Next divisive post I see from any follower of mine is getting blocked.
@realAnnaGardner I'm an American Progressive. You're going to need every single Indy vote you can if you want any single one of your candidates to win. Just remember that next time you start bashing Bernie and what he's fought so hard for. Your message is divisive and only exacerbates division.
@realAnnaGardner @MrFilmkritik I don't think he should run for Presidency. Too many Clintonistas  and neoliberals have issues with him. Hillary shouldn't run either. We need to move forward. Progressives are our future and it was Bernie not Clinton who helped create them all.
