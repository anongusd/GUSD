Vale S.A., the mine owner, is the main source of income for the 37,000 people living in Brumadinho, but as the death toll rose, public anger boiled over. Daily activities became daunting because a mass of thick dark-brown sludge now cut through the town. https://t.co/zs0QznPcWP https://t.co/XbXwVQv6ZT
The dam that collapsed in Brumadinho strained the very definition of “dam,” and had no separate concrete or metal wall to hold back its contents. Instead, it relied on a lake of waste and mud to remain solid enough to contain itself. https://t.co/zs0QznPcWP https://t.co/6Zaw2MotUM
There are 88 mining dams in Brazil built like the one that failed – and all but 4 were rated by the government as equally vulnerable, or worse. At least 28 of those dams sit directly uphill from Brazilian cities and towns, The New York Times found. https://t.co/zs0QznPcWP https://t.co/6c5DvD91AL
A tragedy – but hardly a surprise, experts said. It was the second deadly dam collapse in Brazil in 3 years. The dam was built on the cheap, warnings were overlooked and monitoring equipment had stopped working. https://t.co/zs0QznPcWP https://t.co/QljidtF6V6
On January 25 in Brumadinho, Brazil, a tidal wave of mining waste — enough to fill almost 5,000 Olympic swimming pools — unleashed by a collapsing dam swallowed at least 157 people https://t.co/zs0QznPcWP
