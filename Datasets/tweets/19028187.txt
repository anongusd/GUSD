Also, The Boss puts on a hell of a show.
Going to see The Boss.
@AJ_Rogers The gen 2 Rock Band guitars are better than the first mushy ones, but I still prefer the clicky-clicky of the explorers.
I bought 4 Explorer style wired 360 guitars from Toys R Us yesterday for 8 bucks a piece.  Win.
@scrapplesandwic I know, I know...  Rock star, etc... Somebody has to....
Rockets game!  Andiamo...
@QuakeXBLA  Is it true that you are totally awesome?  I've heard it said...
And my teammate won his class at the same track in a Mitsu Eclipse, PI400.  Go Team PPKramer!
Basking in the glow of a win in the first Forza 2 race of the new season. 400hp '69 Dodge Charger, PI550 at Suzuka West for the win 25 laps
Haircut, dishes, new towel bar mounted, Rockets game, all in one day!
I think I'll stay awake instead of climbing back into bed after breakfast.  Maybe get to work on that new towel bar in the bathroom.
Woo, re-disabled the autoconnect from dev environment to source control that I accidentally enabled.  Time to discover vulcanized rubber.
DON'T YOU JUDGE ME!!!  (uh, I mean, goodnight... *cough*)
Lessons from GDC: 1. you CAN gain 7 pounds in 4 days.  2. The accompanying reflux is tenacious.
@matthewhemby liarpants. #liarpants
I need a job that just lets me continually travel westward, constantly taking advantage of time zones...
props to both Lucky 13 and Annie's Social Club in SF.  Good times and I will be signing autographs for the karaoke album coming out in fall
trying to convince people to walk 2 miles...
pricey but delicious lunch at Anchor & Hope.
@jfaulken Seriously...  I'm skipping breakfast this morning, not because I'm tired, but because I think I'm still full...
I will never need to eat again.  Farmer Brown's in San Fran = soul food for the win.
Protip: The W hotel in San Francisco has iPod docking/recharging/amplification stations in the rooms.  So, there's that.
Anybody who really wants to know about the glamor of game development need only head to the bar @ the W in San Fran tonight.  Life lessons.
@matthewhemby heading to Bar Kramer
@matthewhemby HAW-HAW
getting ready to fly to San Fran...  uh, on a plane.
finally solved the mystery of the 99%-working code merge...
Mmmmm...  Sunrise Earth...
@matthewhemby Wishful thinking, right?
If you can't defend your position on an issue without resorting to denigrating your opponent's, perhaps you should consider it further.
Glen Beck is an embarrassment to conservatives and an easy target for liberals.
Can we please call a moratorium on the word "outrage?"  Please?  You can still be miffed, bothered, annoyed, disturbed, frightened, etc...
Second day in a row of Transtar showing traffic to be green.  Have I been Left Behind?
Still not used to 7:15am being dark.
Flapper flapping within nominal parameters.
Going to install a new flapper in the toilet today.  Try to contain your excitement.
Observing Pi day here at Pi.
Heard "The Final Countdown" and "Lonely is the Night" on the way in, so today started well. Then my PC wouldn't recognize my keyboard. &gt;.&lt;
@idl3mind At first glance, I thought that said "Bryan Adams and Mandy Moore Marry..."  I thought he was a bit old for her. Sorry Bryan.
Yay.  Update to Empire.  Hopefully this is the patch that sets bCrash to false..
I want to like Empire: Total War.  I really, really do.  But really?  Crashing when you select units?  QA much?
My back...  Seriously...  You guys...  &lt;/cartman&gt;
went involuntarily unconscious tonight.  Let it never be said that game development is dull.
See also: why PC gaming lost to consoles...
I mean, God forbid I would actually want to play a game the same day I bought it.
@davidkenobi I used babelfish and got the general idea.  Guess I won't be getting this one, as I'm already a huge Forza fan (1000/1000)
Anybody out there had good/bad experience with laser shifters?

Velvet Lounge verdict: good place to hang out if you're advanced beyond fratboy 3 degree ballcap tilt but don't feel like popping collars
Horseradish recommendation:  Inglehoffer Wasabi.
Anybody ever been to the Velvet Lounge in Houston?  Good?  Bad?  Think I'm gonna try that one tonight.
Houston Transtar says: maps shows green, traffic is clean.
@matthewhemby Bingo.  Bingo.
It is absolutely beautiful today.  Fortunately, a crappy front comes in just in time for it to be here before work ends.
believes that too much emphasis is placed on obeying arbitrary rules and not enough is placed on actually matching ability to allowance.
@rainnwilson If said celebrity is actually educated on said issue and not merely playing an analogue of a car "spokesmodel," yes.
under 180 for the 2nd day in a row.  Go go South Beach...
I think what the video game world needs is a new 2nd person shooter to come along and shake things up.

@kennhoekstra There's a certain amount of irony with T-Mac being on the tickets for tonight, isn't there?
@michaelianblack I've always wanted to be a suzerain or an ombudsman.
Gotta love late winter along the Gulf Coast.  Crawfish buckets of awesomeness...
Time to roll.  Fingers crossed for a wide open left lane.
@clairecmc Who said that, Senator?  That's going on a plaque on my desk.
As the Nixon-Kennedy debates showed us, those who can embrace and use technology will leave those who can't behind.
Just went through a spate of following Congressional followers.  Sure is interesting who is Tweeting vs who isn't.
..or who use the phrase, "I'm just saying" as if that somehow absolves you of any consequences of whatever you just said.
If @hodgman can rant about "meh," can I rant about people who start anything with "Umm."
Sometimes this job is an amazing mix of linear algebra, analyzing industry trends, and looking for new LOLcats...
@hodgman I agree with you about, "meh."  Now, how do you feel about "hurr?"
@MrSocial It doesn't make you nerdy at all, and I'm not just saying that because I have the double-bladed Darth Maul one...
@davidkenobi Achievements get people to do things they wouldn't normally do.  Add an achievement to purchasing DVDs through the 360..	.
@davidkenobi From a gamer's perspective, lame.  From a marketing perspective, brilliant.
@davidkenobi Such as?

@bmoreoriginal Definitely one of the more disturbing mash-ups I've heard in a while.
@matthewhemby  I believe the children are the future.  We should teach them well and let them lead the way.
@DJWildWagon Unfortunately, the Wii version doesn't have Nazi Zombie mode, so I personally would get it on another platform.
@scrapplesandwic To be fair, I couldn't quite touch him.  I could lob my Initech mug over our monitors, though.
@scrapplesandwic Yeah, Kenn's been here a bit.  He sits 6 ft. from me, so it seems silly to Tweet at him, but, hey, I'm silly.
@kennhoekstra No sir.  No you're not.
@jfaulken I'll probably go back to working on getting Fallout 3 taken care of, but my addiction to racing has been rekindled recently...
@scrapplesandwic You can visit during the day.  You just have to sign an NDA giving me permission to kill you and take your stuff.
@scrapplesandwic I confess I've played more Forza 2 than is healthy for most people.  We have  league at work...
Got my first 1000 out of 1000 achievement points on a 360 game last night.  Man, I love Forza 2, except for all the fail it has.
I like leading a team.  I like being on a team.  Leading a team AND being on the same is a challenge, though.
I drove 190 MPH tonight.  It was pretty nice.
Just saw two raccoons fighting in my backyard...  sounded like somebody screaming bloody murder!
Going out to lunch for the first time in over a month, 12 pounds lighter.  I figure I can enjoy a good burger as a reward.
I love figuring out the lynchpin problem that allows a whole bunch of other stuff to just fall into place...
up early to make breakfast... now back to bed for an hour before starting the day for real...
@scrapplesandwic Too bad *either* of the two voted to leave didn't go.
Just made my fist mango lassi.  It's delicious, if you can stand the texture.  I can see how some people couldn't.
@fantasyvsreal Wow, that takes me back!  I love this song.
I am convinced that regardless of witicisims to the contrary, one must occasionally argue with the pig, in the mud. Bacon ain't free.
Sacrificed my precious sideburns to the cause today.  New high and tight cut requires it - but they'll be back...
@scrapplesandwic Ok, I just saw Hell's Kitchen.  Man, I hate what TV has become...  Gordon is still the man, though.
@scrapplesandwic I saw an American Kitchen Nightmares today.  Too much Springer, not enough actual business acumen.  B minus :)
Look out world, I'm going to be doing some actual programming today!  It's been a while.
@MdmPoppyFields I had an awesome bacon and egg ice cream served as a starter at Catalan here in Houston.  THAT was good.
Trophy ceremonies remind me of the monkeys and the monolith scene in 2001.
Um.  Wow.
Adrian Wilson...  HURRRRR
Roughing the passer my foot... #superbowl
If that's too deep, I offer this: Try something you've never eaten before because it sounded "gross."  Trust me, just do it.
This has been said many times by those far wiser than me, but... True wisdom comes from finding out what you don't know.
@davidkenobi Looks good, and you've got all my faves showing :)
No bocce, plenty of beer.  All in all a fair trade.
I'm off to play bocce at Hans Bier Haus in Rice Village.  Bringing my boot o' beer with me...
Software recommendation for the day: Agent Ransack.  Beats the crap out of Windows file searching.
Hey @StephenColbert, I made a Blagojevich/Christ joke two days ago!  Royalties, please!
@Street3 Preach on, brother.
Just saw the trailer for the new 50 cent game on ign and I'm dumber for it.

8 hours later, my HDTiVo/CableCARD/Digital Phone Fiasco is resolved!  Thanks to all the techs involved.  I know it's not your fault :)
Video game related question for people:  What's the worst part of your favorite game?  Bonus:  How would you fix it?
@majornelson Used to be Blues, sCary's, and Evil Avatar.  These days it's mostly just Kotaku.  Oh how times have changed...
@drspectrum CTRL-C, CTRL-V?  I thought that came somewhere between crawling and potty training on the scale of child development.
@MdmPoppyFields Some of the guys at the office can drum on Expert.  Everlong is something to behold-especially when they go head-to-head!
@MdmPoppyFields truth be told, you're probably a better drummer than I am.  I'm still only Medium and a bit into Hard on drums :)
@secretidcrisis WWZ is a great read.  I'm almost done with the Zombie Survival Guide.  It's a great follow-up.
Yay, Tivo snagged a couple Kitchen Nightmares off BBCA that I haven't seen yet.
@Mia Head north.They'll freeze as the temperature drops.  Remember, you gotta shoot 'em in the head!
@MichaelMillman I immediately wonder what they're trying to sell me.
@mrbornac You're driving trains?
@scrapplesandwic Well, you were pimpin' like it *IS* easy.
@coreyanderson Nearly every time I have people over to my house it turns into a Rock Band party.  Last week's DLC was Steve Miller!  Woo!
@coreyanderson Which console did you get in on?
@coreyanderson Heheh.  Yeah, it's been cool to be a part of those franchises.  They're both forces of nature.
@annwillmott Heck yes!  Sort of potato-y, but not.  A little sweeter. Jicama, tomato, black beans, cilantro, lime, oil, cumin = yum.
@scrapplesandwic You make me feel like a young Jodi Foster, except for the plumbing.
I just ate Jicama for the first time (to my knowledge) and it is delicious.
@scrapplesandwic What criteria do you use?
@scrapplesandwic Not sure if Hell's Kitchen is my thing.  Not big on the elimination shows, or cooking (on TV).
Hey Blagojevich, get off the cross.  We need the wood.
New Top Gear!  Woot!
I hate coming back from a run and finding some variety of poo on my shoe -- after I've already come into the house.
Time to go home for dinner..  *poof*
@drspectrum He'll have to get past Mr. Bun first.  Fear the Attack Rabbit!
Some, some, some of them I murder.  Some, some I let go.
