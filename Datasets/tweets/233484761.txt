@JohnPizarro4 (Also worth saying that, as with the reduction in the mortgage-interest giveaway, the standard deduction increase offsets the SALT changes for most people, which considerably limits the constituency for repeal.)
@JohnPizarro4 If you mean the reduction won’t be around for long, it’s possible. But unlikely. SALT’s a giveaway to wealthy people in blue states and, as such, a hard sell for a Democratic party that likes to insist it’s for the middle class. I suspect the whole package will be made permanent.
@JohnPizarro4 What do you mean “it won’t be around for long”? The SALT deduction existed from 1913 onwards (and briefly during the Civil War). It was reduced dramatically in 2017. Nothing was done “at once”; it wasn’t abolished, there is still a $10,000 deduction.

@JohnPizarro4 And before someone says “but X state receives more in spending than Y state,” that may be true. But that’s your preference, not mine. I’m a libertarian and a federalist. I don’t want these federal subsidies at all. I’d have abolished them all along with the SALT deduction.
@JohnPizarro4 That’s still true to an extent because the SALT deduction wasn’t completely abolished, as it should have been. But it is far smaller now, which is why you’re paying more overall. And you should. It’s not my problem that your state has high taxes, and I don’t want to subsidize it.
@JohnPizarro4 I live in Florida. It has no income tax. Under previous rules, I got no break on my federal taxes, but you did. If you paid a dollar to the state, you didn’t pay it to the federal government. That meant you paid less in federal taxes than I did because your state had high taxes.

@Packers128 @Acosta Maybe. I'm indifferent toward the wall. I honestly don't care either way. But that's not the argument he made.
@PhillipBroz I'm not opposed to building a wall. I'm not for open borders. I'm strongly against illegal immigration. None of those things has anything to do with my desire to keep our constitutional order intact.
@Acosta Presumably, Jim, the counter-argument would be that you don't see "a national emergency situation" precisely because there's a wall of the sort that those you're criticizing want to extend.
@Blitzkreg6 Both are abusing the underlying statutes. And, for the last time, we do not judge the constitutionality—or statutory acceptability—of executive orders numerically. Executive orders are not per se problematic; only if they are ultra vires.
@justinr10519174 @VoteKillface @sloughdespond On the contrary: I make that monarchical comparison every time a president acts in foreign policy without the permission of Congress.

@molratty Ultimately, this approach gives the game away. Its advocates believe that judges should use their position to impose their private preferences. And so they don’t want anyone on the bench with different private preferences than their own. (4/4)
@molratty “Well, Mrs. James, your record is outstanding. But I see you believe privately that Congress should legalize heroin. That is out of step with American law, and as a result you are disqualified.” (3)
@molratty Not only would that exclude pretty much every religious person from the bench—imposing a de facto religious test—it would also exclude anyone who belonged to an advocacy group such as the ACLU, the NRA, Americans for Tax Reform, the DSA, and so forth. (2)
@molratty I’m intrigued—and mildly alarmed—by the idea that if you belong to a civil institution that holds different views than obtain within the contemporary legal status quo, you should be presumed incapable of upholding that legal status quo. (1)

@coopersam339 I’m strongly in the American camp. I don’t know if I’ve written a direct comparison, but I’ve made various similar points in the course of my everyday writing.
My two-year-old just gave me a Letter of the Day cookie, and told me in earnest that I have to eat it myself, and am not allowed “to put it in the shark’s mouth or the the alligator’s mouth, because that’s dangerous.”
@Bhess I will be complaining about this when I’m 80.
@FlyFisher_AKY It’s actually thriving. But if it were to go extinct because it opposed imbuing the president with monarchical powers, well, that wouldn’t be greatest of indignities.
@bcook128 No, I’m just noting that Congress as a whole has not agreed to do it, which is why Trump is talking about invoking emergency powers.
One of the greatest Anglo-American innovations was the supremacy of parliament over the King, which manifested itself in America in a slightly amended way. Under presidents and Congresses of both parties we’ve severely damaged this innovation in recent decades. Let’s stop. (5/5)
And, for the record, this view is in no way a smokescreen over the specific policy questions at hand. I‘m indifferent toward both the DREAM Act and toward spending $5bn on a wall. But far more important than those things is the supremacy of Congress in matters legislative. (4)
It won’t, but Congress’s main priority for the next few years should be repealing all of the Enabling Acts it has passed over the last eighty years so that there’s no scope for executives to try this. (The courts should be more active here, too, but they won’t be now.) (3)
This was true under Obama and it’s true under Trump. This new habit, in which White House lawyers try to find clever ways of defying the explicit will of the legislature, is a disgraceful one and makes a mockery of the constitutional order. (2)
If Congress wants to do that, it can. But if it doesn’t, it doesn’t. And if it doesn’t, the correct response from the executive is to say “okay, Congress said ‘no.’” It is not to find spurious ways of doing it anyway. (1) https://t.co/nscEKSRvYs
It would be an extraordinary abuse of power. “If Congress won’t, I will” is no more legitimate a presidential position now than it was five years ago. In the meantime, Congress should act to make that clear. https://t.co/3gcaepPLTp

@jonst0kes The point I’m making is that this stuff isn’t actually controversial. It doesn’t drive anything significant. And the less it’s crowded out, the more popular it remains.
@jonst0kes Arguable. Either way, it’s not expensive. You could fund that sort of research for decades without even having a federal personal income tax. And besides, revenues aren’t down relative to GDP; we’re just spending on other things. Our spending priorities changed.
@jonst0kes Because if it is, you’ll find a lot of conservatives who don’t want to raise rates on top earners who would prefer to spend tax dollars on the equivalent of transistor research than on redistribution. (2/2)
@jonst0kes Did we bring in more revenues as a percentage of GDP then? Or was it pretty much the same? I’m slightly confused as to how this relates to the question of who pays what. Isn’t it a question of what we should spend on? (1)

@MatthewArend @ChrisHerc @TPCarney The drivers of spending are entitlements and the military. That is where the debate lies. Telling people who want reform that they should cease to use the roads—and implying they oppose modernity—is absurd.
@MatthewArend @ChrisHerc @TPCarney I’m not the one acting in bad faith. The debate here is not over whether we should fund roads, and nor would making even sweeping changes to the system imperil that basic (quasi-)public good. And you know that.
@MatthewArend @ChrisHerc @TPCarney We could abolish federal income taxes completely and still have more than enough money to pay for the roads. That is not where the big money is spent.
@jonst0kes Just noting that one can oppose this proposal while understanding how the tax system works, and declining to cast all taxation as theft.

@CarCaster I retweeted a bunch. You can run through my timeline. But I'll be honest with you, Jason, playing "Admit my weird theories about you are correct!" with you is not a great use of my time. It's Monday. It's sunny outside. I'm going to leave it there.
@CarCaster I’m a national columnist who lives, votes, works, and pays taxes in Florida. My home is here. My children are here. Of course I paid close attention to this and not other states: This is my state. What a preposterous argument. You’re a conspiracy theorist—and a poor one at that.
@CarCaster And yes, those inconsistencies mattered, and the incompetence mattered, and the violations of the law mattered. Don’t believe me? Look at the Miami Herald. That they weren’t fraudulent doesn’t change that. They needed covering.
@CarCaster I did precisely the same as every local journalist in Florida: Reported on what was happening. You’ll find exactly the same stories in every local paper. Why? Because this stuff matters. Not everything must be extrapolated out. I was clear in every national interview I did.
@CarCaster And while we are doing this: I never once alleged fraud. I said only that Broward and PB counties were incompetent and in violation of the Public Records Act, which they were. I was precise and responsible with my words throughout. That you can’t read doesn’t alter that.
@CarCaster No. I’m just making a joke. Are you slow, or just humorless?

(Also worth pointing out that, had it been that close, Broward's shifting "er, we've decided not to use our recount" position would have been challenged and litigated.)
Addendum: Regarding the "bad ballot design" theory, if you subtract the number of votes for the Senate race in Broward from the number of votes for the Governor's race in Broward, and assume the same voting ratio, Nelson picks up 9,505 votes. Scott won by 10,333.

@Holden114 @Bravo24Actual @PatriotBeezer If you move ten steps on the board without discussing what happens during those steps, you can get there, yes.
@Holden114 @Bravo24Actual @PatriotBeezer Okay. But in the Hitler scenario, the government wouldn’t be untethered either. Indeed, the only way it could prevail given our gun ownership rates is if it enjoyed the support of a supermajority that had no desire to remove it. Which is the point!
@Holden114 @Bravo24Actual @PatriotBeezer Which means you have to assume that there is sufficient enthusiasm for gun control to push its advocates to support the use of tanks, aircraft, and worse on the recalcitrant. And there is not.
@Holden114 @Bravo24Actual @PatriotBeezer But it wouldn’t be untethered. From the government’s perspective, it would be crushing a rebellion in the name of the people who weren’t rebelling.
@kris_kinder @Holden114 @Bravo24Actual @PatriotBeezer Same with the Volstead Act, which held that “no person shall manufacture, sell, barter, transport, import, export, deliver, or furnish any intoxicating liquor except as authorized.” (2)
@kris_kinder @Holden114 @Bravo24Actual @PatriotBeezer No. Existing alcohol supplies were left alone, which is why wealthy families that had large cellars drank legally and normally throughout Prohibition. 18th Amendment banned “manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors.” It didn’t confiscate. (1)
@Holden114 @Bravo24Actual @PatriotBeezer The U.S. government has those things in 2018 in Afghanistan, too.
@Holden114 @Bravo24Actual @PatriotBeezer Besides, America has the same sense of “decency/humanity” abroad, albeit probably less, and it *still* can’t defeat determined foes with small arms (see: Vietnam, Afghanistan). It would have no chance of doing so here.
@Holden114 @Bravo24Actual @PatriotBeezer Not sure where you’re getting that. During the Revolution, not only was America divided, but so was the British parliament, in which about a third of lawmakers opposed the war. It’s assumed in the calculation that it’s a domestic, and therefore likely attenuated, conflict. (1)
@kolatubosun @ABC Not like Rick Scott, no, because Rick Scott is up by 12,603 votes and has won the election.
@Holden114 @Bravo24Actual @PatriotBeezer At the very least, it would have to care about the opinion of the part of the public not in rebellion, and the opinion of the people being given the orders, and the opinion of its allies watching. As a matter of realpolitik, that would hamstring it.
@Holden114 @Bravo24Actual @PatriotBeezer On the contrary: Whatever rules of engagement obtained in Afghanistan would be heightened in the extreme on domestic soil.
@Holden114 Bingo.

The machine recounts are finished in Florida. DeSantis leads Gillum by 33,683. Scott leads Nelson by 12,603. The latter race now goes to a manual recount, with associated lawfare.

@MarcACaputo I think he’d have been accused of interference, and worse. In Palm Beach last week, the commissioner explicitly called Rubio a racist for his criticisms. And I defer to you on Jeb, but I’ve read a bunch of contemporary newspaper reports and they all mention it prominently.
@MarcACaputo @dablanco79 True.
@GrandKidBlessed @MarcACaputo He put her office under supervision.
@dablanco79 @MarcACaputo That’s an interesting point.
@CodofC @MarcACaputo This is nonsense. Broward elects its own commissioner. This is who Broward wants. Snipes has been re-elected over and over. She herself is a replacement for the last one the GOP had to remove. It’s endemic. This is on the voters in Broward.
@MarcACaputo Because when Jeb had to remove her predecessor for the same thing, with broad Democratic support, he was accused of racism, and that’s exactly what would have happened here, too, along with accusations from the national press that he was trying to steal the election.

RT @GatorsFB: .@HendersonChris_ with the snag 😎		#RelentlessEffort https://t.co/vlb7QCBShO
A Gators comeback, if you can keep it.
RT @GatorsChris: #Gators about to go over 300 yards rushing. It’s what they do best and what they need to do — especially in this game.
The whole thing will be over either way by November 20th, on which day the results are certified. Now I'm off to watch the Gators. They're losing 14-7, but I'm hoping there are a couple of touchdowns in a drawer somewhere in Broward County. (7/7)
Deadline for the machine recount is November 15th at 3pm. Deadline for the manual recount is November 18th at noon. Deadline for remaining overseas/military ballots, which can be counted in the meantime, is November 16th (they must be postmarked on or before November 6th. (6)
Because DeSantis is leading Gillum by 33,684 votes, a margin of 0.410%, his race will not be manually recounted—unless the automatic recount is so dramatic that it reduces the margin to 0.25% or below. Scott's lead, however, is 12,562—0.154%—so a manual recount is guaranteed. (5)
An "overvote" can be more complicated, as canvassing boards are, within reason, permitted to determine voter intent. If there is a faint mark in one candidate's oval but a full mark in another, that might plausibly be counted. A total mess, by contrast, will not be counted. (4)
An "undervote" is almost never counted. If a voter declines to vote for a particular office, that's his choice and there's nothing anyone can do. As such, an "undervote" will only be counted if, say, the optical machine has made an error and failed to pick up a vote. (3)
A "manual recount" does not mean every vote is counted by hand. Rather, it involves canvassing boards checking every "undervote" and "overvote." An "overvote" is when a voter makes more choices than allowed; an "undervote" is when a voter makes no choice, or too few choices. (2)
A few definitions. An "automatic recount" is required for any race with a margin under 0.5%. It involves feeding all the ballots back through the voting machines—including reconstructed damaged ballots. If the new result yields a winning margin over 0.25 the election is over. (1)
Which is to say that, as it stands, Ron DeSantis is the next governor of Florida, and, barring some catastrophic errors in tabulation, or some remarkably creative lawyering, Rick Scott is Florida's next Senator. But it's Florida, so . . . (12/12)
That would be a small enough lead that a recount could potentially change the result. But to get to that point we have to make a lot of pro-Democrat assumptions, and to assume facts not in evidence. It seems unlikely to me that either of these results is going to change. (11)
If we subtract the number of votes for Senate in Broward from the number of votes for Governor, we get 24,992. Assuming that these votes go as did the others, that adds just over 9,000 votes for Nelson. (It doesn't affect DeSantis.) Which leaves Scott with a lead of ~200. (10)
Which brings us, finally, to Marc Elias's theory that the machines in Broward have undercounted the Senate line on the ballot by around 25,000 ballots. I doubt this—and Broward says it's not correct—but, arguendo, let's add it to our previous assumptions. Then what? (9)
Even in that generous scenario, DeSantis keeps a lead of 30,484, while Scott keeps a lead of 9,362. That means Gillum would need 15,242 votes to flip, and Nelson would need 4,681. That seems unlikely—although nothing is impossible. (8)
Remember, that’s a generous estimate because we’re assuming every single outstanding overseas ballot comes in. But, for the sake of argument, let’s make it *more* generous, and assume these votes are twice as Democratic as has been the case thus far. Let's make it ~3,200. (7)
That would yield a DeSantis lead of ~32,000, and a Scott lead of ~11,000. Which would require the recounts to flip, *net*, 16,000 votes to Gillum and 5,500 votes to Nelson. (6)
Given that voters with no party also vote, the best we can do is apply known military registration rates to military data, and apply the results in each county thus far to the county data. If we do this, we get a net increase for both Nelson and Gillum of ~1600 votes. (5)
For the sake of argument, though, let's assume they're all returned—every last one. From what I can gather, we’re looking at ~5,000 military ballots, and then ~15,000 others from around the state. (4)
Around 20,000 overseas/military ballots have yet to be returned. Deadline for their return is the 16th. In reality, a lot of these will never be returned, will arrive too late, or will be rejected. (3)
There are now two things left to do statewide: First, count yet-to-arrive overseas/military ballots; second, proceed to those mandatory recounts. All being equal, neither step looks as if it'll be enough for either Gillum or Nelson. (2)
Florida update. All 67 counties have now reported, and we have an unofficial vote tally. As it stands, DeSantis leads Gillum by 33,684, and Scott leads Nelson by 12,562. That will precipitate an automatic recount for DeSantis, and a manual recount for Scott. (1)
Palm Beach County is still showing as unfinished. Given that the deadline has passed, it's unclear what this means or what the consequences will be. https://t.co/dfmJ2SJevL
Update: Broward has now reported its final vote totals, and in so doing cut DeSantis's lead to 33,684 (a reduction of 825), and Scott's lead to 12,562 (a reduction of 845). https://t.co/zSyWVg0PIV
One caveat: It is unclear whether Palm Beach and Broward Counties have actually done this. The Florida elections website shows that they are still behind, but this may merely be a failure to update. https://t.co/c9pPaWg703

This would mean, at the current ratio, that DeSantis could survive 93,801 more ballots being counted in Broward and Scott could survive 36,071. Are there that many left? It's unclear because Broward is a disaster, run by a crook. But this suggests not: https://t.co/kHmkYQNpgU (4)
It's not entirely clear, but in Palm Beach it seems that there are up to 2,000 provisional, 1,500 military/absentee, and 8,000 write-in ballots left. Even if we assume all provisionals are counted, per current ratio GOPers' leads would drop to 35,738 and 14,580 respectively. (3)
By my calculations—and assuming the same voting ratio in each county as has obtained thus far—DeSantis can weather another 99,135 ballots in Broward without losing his lead, while Scott can weather another 41,405. In Palm Beach, the numbers are 213,724 and 89,265. (2)
Florida update: Ron DeSantis leads Andrew Gillum by 36,333 votes. Rick Scott leads Bill Nelson by 15,175. There are two counties still reporting: Broward, and Palm Beach. Both are strongly Democratic. Nevertheless, things look good for the two Republicans. (1)

@e_blyler @Daniel_Sweeney @RonDeSantisFL @ScottforFlorida I'm not saying it's fraudulent. I'm saying that people are panicking for a good reason. This is odd.
@Mdixon55 I’m not disagreeing with you.
@Daniel_Sweeney @RonDeSantisFL @ScottforFlorida Yes. But part of the panic is because there’s no framework here. Broward is refusing to say how many ballots it has to count, and then every few hours dumping thousands of votes into the machine. So people are sitting wondering if that is going to continue ad infinitum.
It doesn’t help that Brenda Snipes is notoriously incompetent and is already under supervision for destroying ballots in violation of state and federal law. https://t.co/JXlCwPZbgA

@ted_tru @Matt03441 @ByronYork Again: this is begging the question. You're assuming that his actions were irresponsible when that's the question we're debating. I've argued at length that it was not. You can't respond to that by merely assuming the opposite. (Also, the analogy doesn't work.)
@ted_tru @Matt03441 @ByronYork (And by the way, I obviously don't know the exact details with Kavanaugh, but this approach is pretty common: I was asked if I wanted to buy Jacksonville Jaguars season tickets this year, as part of a group of 25 people. One guy was going to buy them, and then be reimbursed.)
@ted_tru @Matt03441 @ByronYork Assuming I trust my friends—and I do, and if I didn't I wouldn't do it—that makes my liability $10,000, or the same as if I'd just bought myself a ticket. The fact that the overall number is big is irrelevant. (2/2)
@ted_tru @Matt03441 @ByronYork Yes, but the mechanics are precisely the same. You're getting hooked on the raw number. If twenty people, plus me, go for dinner, at $100 per head, and I pay, I owe $2,100 but am owed $2,000. Make that $10,000-each season tickets, and it's owe $210,000, but am owed $200,000. (1)
@ted_tru @ByronYork That's good to hear.
@Matt03441 @ted_tru @ByronYork Oh, gotcha. Right. I mean, I'm pretty careful, but if I were ever nominated for anything, people could do this to me, too. I paid for my Dad's surprise 60th birthday party, and all his friends then paid me back. But without context, it would look like I was spending like Jay-Z.
@ted_tru @Matt03441 @ByronYork I have a lot of friends who have more money and disposable income than I do, and I'd happily do this for the group (providing they paid me back immediately, although that's my choice, it's not mandatory). Indeed, the fact they have more money, makes me confident they will.
@ted_tru @Matt03441 @ByronYork Yes, but this isn't a response to what I wrote. You're assuming that it's wrong to buy things for your friends on a credit card and have them pay you back, with or without covering the interest. And I'm asking: Why? What bearing does it have on his job?
@cof53 @ted_tru @Matt03441 @ByronYork Right. As I say, I wouldn't do it because I'm obsessive about paying bills without fees or interest (mortgage aside), and not borrowing anything I can't afford. But if he'd bought a car at 3.9% APR—or even 0%—we wouldn't be having this conversation. And yet that's still "debt."
@ted_tru @Matt03441 @ByronYork Yes. I understand that. But I often put things on my credit card for a bunch of people (tickets, dinner, travel, hotels), then have them pay me immediately, then pay the card off immediately. That's a different thing than borrowing and paying interest on money you've borrowed.
@ted_tru @Matt03441 @ByronYork . . . bearing whatsoever on whether one of them can be a good judge. Even if the friends all agreed to collectively pay the accrued interest, that's their concern. What on earth does it have to do with the cardholder's professionalism? (3/3)
@ted_tru @Matt03441 @ByronYork So if he bought the tickets, then was reimbursed, and then paid off the card, he got an interest-free loan from the bank for a few weeks. I'd certainly do that—and have. Either way, I don't see how a private group of people coming together to buy things together has any . . . (2)
@ted_tru @Matt03441 @ByronYork Well, I wouldn't run up that much debt either—although it depends entirely what is meant here by "debt": if the charges were paid off within a few weeks he'd have incurred no costs at all. because there is a period before charges hit the account, and then a period to pay off. (1)
@Matt03441 @ted_tru @ByronYork I am astonished that this is so hard to grasp. Have you never had a friend book a trip or bachelor party or event and pay for it all himself, and then have the attendees pay him back afterwards?
@ted_tru @ByronYork You're going full-on conspiracy theorist, Ted.
@ted_tru @ByronYork Would I front my best friends money by buying season tickets on a credit card and then have them pay me back? Obviously, yes. It’s no different than paying for dinner on one check, and having everyone give you the money afterwards.

@bljacka @baseballcrank @TPCarney We're not disagreeing.

@IleneJide @mbaram They did not decide that. They decided that they'd rather have the Constitution and maintain slavery than have the Articles of Confederation and maintain slavery. That was the choice. And no, one didn't need the Constitution to end slavery. But it did, in fact, help. (1)

@HowardSlugh @IanCurtisJackso It's also unclear how that would have been better: "They didn't count them as people at all" is not an improvement.
@officialnchia @fadehook @FergusFSU @KeyserSozeBro1 Exactly. This is like saying, "The Constitution was bad because it didn't provide for the abolition of the slave trade until 1808! How can you support a document that permits the slave trade to continue for at least another two decades?" Etc.
@fadehook @FergusFSU @KeyserSozeBro1 No, it's not. Slavery pre-existed the Constitution. The choice before the Founders in 1787 was (1) keep slavery and ratify the Constitution, or (2) keep slavery and not ratify the Constitution. The former was the better option, including for the abolitionist cause.
@mbaram Nonsense. They didn't "decide" not to. There would have been no Constitution. The choice was (1) a Constitution and slavery and abolition of the slave trade, or (2) no Constitution and slavery and no abolition of the slave trade. It wasn't a high school debate class.
@EnthusiastSea @RockNRollMom6 @chadfelixg Yes, I certainly don't want to hear a word about this from anyone who applauded that, or who believes that the Constitution is "living" and that original public meaning interpretations are a plot.
@ChurnDashSlash @RockNRollMom6 @chadfelixg I did. I was outraged by DACA. I wrote about it incessantly.
@IanCurtisJackso The Constitution did not invent slavery, but it did weaken it, and after 1808, abolish the slavery trade. The question was whether to have the Constitution and slavery or no Constitution and slavery. They chose right.
@RockNRollMom6 @chadfelixg It’s not a good idea to “float” unconstitutional behavior.
@Blaknsam Fair.
Maybe. But process matters—and more than anything else. And that the underlying question happens to be 50/50, or that it might help turnout, is no better a rejoinder to that than it was when President Obama did it. https://t.co/vsTG5mA73u

RT @AG_Conservative: Also, do we know when the edits were made? Was it before or after the polygraph?
Dr. Ford's polygraph letter contradicts letter she sent to Feinstein. Polygraph letter says "4 boys and a couple of girls" were at party. Letter to Feinstein says "me and four others." No way to reconcile the two—irrespective of whether she's counting herself in polygraph letter. https://t.co/aWJ10vTDna

@DanInPittsburgh Not that it tells us anything about this case either way, but no, they do not support that. That's nonsense. https://t.co/rkwwFCSvjN
@MarcieSchanfish No, you're making my point: Which is that there's a difference between drinking and blacking out; the relationship between the two is highly individualized; and, given what "blackout" means, it's utterly unprovable either way.
Thread. https://t.co/UMyiks2OnJ
@DanInPittsburgh Ah, and so having exhausted all other options, you settle into presumption of guilt.
@ShawnaOhm No, it's not. "Blackout" means something specific.
@DanInPittsburgh You cannot "see" a blackout. https://t.co/Iz6jWmzFxR
(There aren't my highlights, by the way. They're from the Washington Post's annotated transcript.)
@lma1 They're not my highlights. They're from the Post's transcript.
Look at the chronology. It's not: "Did you drink a lot?" "I went to church and had good friends and liked basketball." It's: "Did you run a gang rape club?" "I went to church and had good friends and liked basketball , and yes we partied but I never committed sexual assault." (2)
Another straw man is that Kavanaugh presented himself as a "choir boy." But he didn't. He talked about church and basketball etc. when asked—I cant believe I'm writing this—whether he ran a gang rape club. After that, he immediately said he drank, went to parties. Transcript: (1) https://t.co/kiqOf0sy8U
@BernsteinZar Right. From the outside, it's impossible to prove either way.
@ShawnaOhm The claim is meaningless. There's no "level" that you can "see."
Indeed. "Passed out" is a wholly different thing than "blackout drunk"—not least because, by definition, it's pretty difficult to commit sexual assault while passed out. https://t.co/q4GlxX5yVd
You can't "see" someone "blackout drunk." It doesn't mean "really drunk." "Blackout drunk" means you don't remember what happened while you were that drunk. It's a form of amnesia—and, at this remove, impossible to prove either way. https://t.co/ajhgSaR9Nb https://t.co/Rm44nG9oJN
@ajrichar Of course it's not exculpatory. Who said it was? The objection is to the pretense that he said something he didn't.
Not only does Kavanaugh himself say that he drank, McCallum clearly acknowledges that this is what she heard him say in her follow-up question about blacking out. "I've never blacked out" is a very, very long way away from "I don't drink." I drink. I've never blacked out. (2)
There's an enormous straw man being established this morning: Namely, that Kavanaugh told McCallum that he didn't drink, and had never done anything embarrassing. He didn't. He said he'd never blacked out, and had never committed sexual assault. Here's the transcript. (1) https://t.co/liiddCxZ85
@AG_Conservative Amazing how quickly "I never blacked out" has become "I didn't drink."
This person manages to spend six tweets saying precisely nothing. https://t.co/u7o8DFGDVH
@__TTMx No, he did not claim that he didn't drink. He said that he never got blackout drunk.
Yes, do. https://t.co/R0eSKo9DKs
@DelanteMedia His claim was that he didn't black out. Somehow, this has been transmuted into the insistence that he said he didn't drink. No sale.
@JeffreyASachs Then he said, “I’ve never sexually assaulted anyone.” Then he was asked “Was there ever a time that you drank so much that you couldn’t remember what happened the night before?” He said, "No, that never happened.”
@JeffreyASachs You say he "made the claim that he did not drink." He didn't. He said "Yes, people might have had too many beers on occasion. I think all of us have probably done things we look back on in high school and regret or cringe a bit, but that’s not what we’re talking about." (1)
@JeffreyASachs He did not say that.

@JFullerPolicy It doesn't matter to you, certainly.
@zakbutterfield It can, yes. And those rules, if based upon the accuser's demands (a bizarre phrase per se), can, and would be, preposterous and illiberal.
@laplanck You're playing games here. In civil trials, plaintiffs state their case first. Defendants respond. On occasion, they’ll sometimes call a defendant as a witness, but the defense ultimately responds to the plaintiff’s case. Ford is trying to exactly reverse that process.
@Txtriallawyer She hasn't called for a state investigation.
@heavysixer33 Correct.
@laplanck No, it does not.

@Txtriallawyer If this happened, it's a crime (subject to SofL, although I believe there are none for this in MD). That crime would have to be investigated by state authorities. But the accuser hasn't called for that—so it doesn't go in the "formal trial conditions she's abiding by" column. (2)
@Txtriallawyer I think we're talking past one another. We're not disagreeing. The accuser's demands were my topic, and you and I were discussing formal trial conditions. The accuser has demanded an FBI investigation. But there's no crime for the FBI investigate, given its jurisdiction. (1)
@Txtriallawyer It’s not a federal crime.
“The Senate isn’t a courtroom” is a good rejoinder to the claim that the Senate is a courtroom. It is not a good explanation of why the Senate should agree to throw out well-established arbitration traditions that make sense on their own terms.
@KevinScura I didn’t say he did. But “this isn’t a courtroom” is not a good excuse for such a farcical demand.
@Txtriallawyer The call has been for the FBI to investigate. But there’s no federal crime being alleged. If you mean that the state police should investigate, fine, but that’s not the demand being made. (It would also be nigh on impossible.)
@Txtriallawyer There can’t be an investigation in any formal criminal sense because there’s no crime (which makes the need for presumption of innocence even greater). I have no objection to subpoenaing witnesses, though.

@Txtriallawyer It’s not a “trial standard” to expect an accusation to precede a defense. It is the only standard, in any context, that makes any sense at all.
@brianros1 The accuser testifying first, and being in the same room, is also the standard in civil litigation.
It’s also unclear to me why it’s just assumed that no delay is unfair to the accuser, but not so much as briefly entertained that delaying might be unfair to the accused, who has insisted he is innocent and who is waiting for a chance to respond. (*3)
Add that to the simultaneous demand that the accuser not have to face the accused, and we’re entering Alice in Wonderland territory. I’m astonished by how many otherwise sensible people have taken these bizarre requests in their stride. (2/2)
I’m not sure I’ve ever heard anything quite as preposterous—and illiberal—as the demand that an accuser should testify second in a public hearing. What exactly would the accused be responding to? Extraordinary. (1)
@jtLOL I’m impressed by how brazenly some have managed to ensure that no serious hearing is possible *and* complain about that.

@AaronBlake Or, put another way, it is impossible to say “I have never witnessed any improper conduct by Brett Kavanaugh toward women” and to have seen what Ford alleges. I don’t think his statement is weaker in any way.

@freeandclear1 It is the height of irresponsibility—and illiberalism—for a U.S. Senator to half-release an anonymous accusation. If an accuser wants to stay anonymous, that's fine, but s/he can't also expect to repeat the benefits attendant to an accusation.

And yes, this is in part because the Red Sox are just magnificent this year. But the Yankees have basically been three teams this season: a .500 team, then a .750 team, and then a .500 team again. At the moment, they seem allergic to capitalizing on opportunities.
For a few months they were unpredictable—and in a good way. You never knew what they’d do, even if they were down badly. But now you can see where a game is going by the end of the third. The Red Sox, by contrast, always seem as if they’ll come back.
There’s just something infuriating about this team at the moment. They’re 7-3, on course to win 100+ games, and comfortably have the second best record in baseball, but in the last month they’ve been so annoying. It’s all or nothing.

@jadler1969 @Techn0phobe Not to mention that the idea that the ACA was “conservative” only works in relation to other things conservatives don’t want (Clinton’s plan, single payer), and the idea that the GOP opposed it only because Obama liked it is hysterical revisionism.

What *would* have changed? If you gave the House judicial confirmation power, and insisted its majority reflect the "popular vote," there'd likely be more lower court judges who were put there by . . . Republicans. https://t.co/uULDlsJXEX (4/4)
In fact, you could abolish the Senate completely and move to a unicameral parliamentary system, and in all but one of the Supreme Court nomination cases in the last 27 years, the outcome would have been the same. https://t.co/uULDlsJXEX (3)
The upshot is that . . . nothing would have changed about the Supreme Court. Nothing. Moreover, if you give the House "Advice and Consent" powers *and* insist that its majority must reflect the "popular vote," the upshot is . . . also no change. https://t.co/uULDlsJXEX (2)

This is the key point. Even if one were more of a dove on Russia—and if one wanted to give Trump the benefit of the doubt with Putin—what we just saw would still be utterly reprehensible. https://t.co/8wu2KA96Nh

@KngFish I’m pleased for France. I actually thought Croatia was the better team for much of the game. It was an excellent final.

@bljacka @joec522 Correct, although you still need a fairly broad (historically, not now) reading of the Commerce Clause to get there.
@bljacka @joec522 I wouldn’t be a good lawyer for him, no.
@bljacka @joec522 Which is why our framework should be originalist. No, we won’t get it right every time. But striving to do so keeps the process legitimate.
@bljacka @joec522 Of course. But originalism requires more than just textualism in a vacuum.
@bljacka @joec522 We’ve done this before. No, because there’s no Bill of Rights yet and the federal government isn’t limited by the enumerated powers doctrine in that jurisdiction.

@RealGrumpyPug Mansplaining is a ridiculous term designed to shut down conversation, and anyone using it should be laughed at.
@joec522 Either way, this has no bearing on the central question, which is which rights are enumerated. Self-evidently, abortion is not.
@joec522 I’ve read the Ninth Amendment and strongly disagree that this is what it means. It seems clear, given its provenance, that it was intended to square the circle between the enumerated powers doctrine and the Bill of Rights. I can’t see how it is justiciable.
But that’s not, in fact, the discussion. The discussion revolves around whether such a right exists within a particular legal document, the U.S. Constitution. That is a separate issue from what the law should or should not be. https://t.co/Q4n2v2iFMg
@Oneoneder Nobody argued that was an enumerated right.
That abortion is not an “enumerated right” is literally true, and shouldn’t be a controversial statement even in the eyes of those who think Roe v Wade was correctly decided. The majority of the plurality in Casey acknowledged as much in their opinions. https://t.co/oNYI8Wda96

@cjane87 Perhaps. But I think not because I’m more saying that I can see a narrow argument for enhancing penalties when people make themselves more difficult to recognize/catch, even as I’d likely oppose them in practice. But I can’t see the good argument for this extremely broad measure.
@jstillman1960 That’s exactly correct.
@cjane87 I think there’s a case to be made for that—although given the effect of enhanced penalties in other areas, I’d likely oppose it—but this isn’t even that. It’s dangerously vague.
@JakubDopieralla @spacemanspiff76 I don’t use this word lightly, but I consider that tyranny.
@jstillman1960 True.

@SkepticalAFboii Insofar as it exists, it would be a judicial goal.
@Bentos03 Me, for example. But I’d also think Roe were wrongly decided if I were pro-choice. I’m pro-contraception and I think Griswold was wrong. I’m pro-gay marriage and I think Obergefell was wrong. I’m anti-death penalty but think the Constitution is silent on the question. Etc.
@kdgrego If it were a weak argument and the intention were to manipulate the Constitution’s text in order to achieve a particular policy aim, yes. I have never looked into this so I don’t have a view either way. Initially, I can’t see how it would square with original public meaning.
This is nonsense. The argument against Roe—and one not solely made by conservatives—is that its legal reasoning is weak to non-existent because the Constitution is silent on that question. To endorse that view is not “activism,” but the opposite. https://t.co/HpN0mIH9UE
@WDavidD334 Nothing. The question isn’t whether you or I think he’s “qualified.” The question is whether the Senate wants him. The Senate didn’t want Garland, or anyone with his judicial philosophy. It did want Gorsuch. We’ll see if it wants Kavanaugh.

@BernsteinZar It’s not departing from the text given that the original public meaning held that it was a political process and Congress itself got to decide what counted.
@BernsteinZar This tallies neither with what the Framers wrote about the power, nor what the Court has ruled.
The only question even *raised* in passing in Nixon v. United States (by Blackmun, White, and Souter) was whether the judicial branch could get involved in the absence of a non-arbitrary *process*. It has never been suggested that the courts can arbitrate substantively. (3/3)
Not only has the non-justiciability of impeachment proceedings been long understood, including by the Framers, but it was affirmed unanimously by the Supreme Court in Nixon v. United States. https://t.co/di9VmJTqz7
No, it couldn’t. Congress can impeach for whatever reason it wants—including that a president has yellow hair. Impeachment is not a legal proceeding, but a political one, and the definitions are up to Congress. Courts do not get to review the decision. (1) https://t.co/UQdAuv6vwn

NR’s editorial on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh: https://t.co/liGh8eDx9p
@ChrisLogicMedia This would never happen under Kavanaugh.
@SenBooker Don’t worry, he won’t uphold our broken campaign finance laws. He’ll strike them down, just as Kennedy did.
@benwikler Have you thought about reading what he actually wrote?
@PGuarasci @Schneider_CM I love this game.
RT @jsende: @charlescwcooke MSNBC is going all in on this theme. Shocking, I know.
@gtumuluri True.
@JakubDopieralla No, one can’t.
Why is it ridiculous? Other than that (1) Kavanaugh wrote that Congress should pass a law in this area, not that the courts have a say; (2) There’s no such prosecution coming; (3) Its integrity wouldn’t be up to him, even if there were. https://t.co/Zmp7fWgVCy
@LisaBuethe Thank you.
I see that the ridiculous “Kavanaugh will make sure Trump isn’t sent to prison” conspiracy theory has already filtered down into every other Twitter reply.
RT @SenJohnMcCain: Judge Brett Kavanaugh has impeccable credentials &amp; a strong record of upholding the Constitution. He is widely respected…

@LawoftheGator Indeed.
@HashtagGriswold He’s not “confusing” so much as he’s “lying."
The private comments he made, in Montana in 2013, suggested that the question would at some point come before the Court, and that the idea that they were protected was by no means a silly one. https://t.co/8UZvu9YFWN

@OMWithCandy I’m not sure what “belong” means. The only basis judges have to remove questions from the democratic process is the text of the Constitution. Either way, the point I’m making is that it’s absurd for those defending those decisions to talk about public opinion.
The rest of the hysterical piece aside, this makes no sense. It was decidedly non-conservative, non-Leoesque courts that took *these exact questions* away from the democratic process. This is projection, as usual. https://t.co/OFBwZ8F4tS
