At the very least, it paints him as an unbelievably incompetent executive who can't be trusted to exercise one of the core responsibilities of the presidency, which is choosing people to fill key government positions.
So the GOP line is that it sure is an unfortunate coincidence that Trump hired mendacious criminals to manage both his personal affairs and his presidential campaign.		The president isn't a criminal, he's just surrounds himself with criminals, is not a comforting defense.
The Republican Party needs to step back and do some thinking on how they ended up arguing that the president's personal lawyer and fixer is such a criminal and a liar that his testimony that he was always a criminal and a liar can't be believed.

But we tend to judge politics more on language and messaging than on policy, so the media, in particular, gets this wrong constantly.
@bradplumer That's Emily Oster, I think.
The diversity of the Democratic coalition requires language that recognizes individual group experiences and policy that stretches across group experiences. The Republican coalition encourages the reverse.
Democrats have to keep an almost unimaginably large group of stakeholders happy. Republicans are managing a tension between white identity politics, which they feed through social policy and cultural fights, and corporations/donors, who drive their economic and regulatory policy.
What are the policies on the left with the most energy? Medicare-for-All. Green New Deal. Huge EITC expansions. All of them are universal. On the right? The wall and other immigration restrictions are driving GOP politics.
The Democratic Party is a coalition of lots of different groups which means, to unify, it needs big policies that matter to all its groups simultaneously. The Republican Party is much more homogenous, and that‚Äôs reflected in its policy demands, too.
This thing where Democrats brand universal programs ‚Äúreparations‚Äù seems like bad politics, but illustrates something interesting and underappreciated about the Democratic coalition. https://t.co/wWHlvY6pks

I think there are more examples of this being done successfully than people tend to admit. California, for instance, is imperfect, but it's a functioning, proud, multiethnic liberal democracy.
The hard question for politics in our age is how to calm the reaction rather than appeasing it by demanding the concessions be made by people who've already made so many.

Come for the Howard Schultz analysis, stay for the @Malki Batman comic: https://t.co/2BeXPN8QTy https://t.co/7fsrZHjYK4
Howard Schultz, for all his stated concern about political representation, isn‚Äôt talking about the way money distorts representative democracy.		What he is doing is embodying the way money distorts representative democracy. https://t.co/2BeXPN8QTy
Howard Schultz's agenda is basically Chuck Schumer's agenda, plus an overriding belief that Howard Schultz should be president. 		From both his policy speech and town hall, he doesn't disagree with the median House Democrat on much aside from his own ambitions.
"How can you a spoil a system that is already broken" is a sentence that makes sense until you think about it for literally two seconds, and then it doesn't.		If Schultz wanted to "fix" the two-party system, he'd be funding ballot initiatives to pass proportional representation. https://t.co/twSoSlcUfk
Schultz frames the villain as political parties, but political parties are far more responsive to voters than the problem that Schultz embodies, but doesn‚Äôt discuss: money. https://t.co/2BeXPN8QTy
Anyway, as the kids say, read the whole thing. https://t.co/2BeXPN8QTy
But if Schultz believes *his own* diagnosis of America‚Äôs problems, he‚Äôs flirting with a strategy that has a good chance of making everything worse.
There's a lot a public-spirited billionaire could do to improve politics, and address the specific problems Schultz is worried about. He could fund efforts to pass proportional representation across the country, for instance.
And taking the billionaire‚Äôs express lane into presidential politics, just a few years after Donald Trump did the same thing, would be further proof to Americans that they live in an unrepresentative oligarchy.
Governing as a ‚Äúcentrist independent‚Äù free of party would generate gridlock and conflict in a system that is organized around political parties. Schultz has no theory of Congress or legislating that makes sense. He just has a theory of himself.
Running as a third-party candidate in a first-past-the-post election system is likelier to reinforce the two-party duopoly, and the dangers of third parties, then to open America to multiparty democracy.
Howard Schultz's presidential campaign is based on three ideas, and they're all wrong. https://t.co/2BeXPN8QTy

If this is what a moderate plan looks like in the 2020 Democratic primary, I am very much looking forward to the coming healthcare debate.
That he is able to try and sell a plan this ambitious using conservative rhetoric ‚Äî he frames himself as the moderate incrementalist, cautious of too much change, too fast ‚Äî shows how much space Sanders has opened on health care.
That said, Delaney's plan is very ambitious ‚Äî it looks like the French system ‚Äî even though Delaney sets himself up as an opponent of Medicare-for-All in this interview.
My beef with this debate over single-payer and innovation is I'd like to see people propose plans built to maximize innovation, not just use innovation as a way to defend the pricing status quo, which even conservatives agree leaves America footing the world's innovation bill.
In general, the idea of "cost" in health care is less fixed than people give it credit for. "Cost" isn't a constant concept. It depends on what the market will bear, how much providers expect to make, etc.
You could imagine a government health system setting prices so low it discourages some innovation. It's hard for me to imagine that happening here given how America's political system works. I think it's likelier we do too little to negotiate down prices than too much.
Delaney says: "If you have the government as the only payer in health care, all the evidence suggests the government will not pay cost. Therefore, no one will invest in health care anymore."		There's no evidence for this ‚Äî consider the defense industry as a counterexample.

This is advice I've gotten, it's advice we give every writer at Vox, and it's good advice in life: be overgenerous with credit, with links, with pointers. Build the ecosystem. Readers won't think less of you for it, they'll think more of you.
I think even if Abramson had cited to the standards she's setting out, the citations would've been ungenerous given how much she was relying on others work. It shouldn't be endnotes, but text. "As a terrific article by so-and-so revealed..."
Blogging norms have been integrated much more into traditional media (in part because bloggers have been integrated into traditional media), and while it's still imperfect, and big publications are sometimes ungenerous with smaller publications, it's better than it was.
Blogging changed that. Links were given generously, happily. It was a cooperative ecosystem, not a competitive ecosystem. The work of others made your work possible. Linking to their work made your work more useful to the reader. It was all good.
To frame this more in the big issues her book is about, this is a way in which new media improved the media. 		There was a culture in journalism ‚Äî and the NYT in particular ‚Äî where you wanted everything to look like your own, and credit was given begrudgingly, if at all.

People looking for persuasion from Trump are always disappointed. Trump practices polarization, not persuasion. His speeches are about firing up his side. They're about raising the stakes. 		Problem is, his side is getting smaller, and they no longer control the House.
If Donald Trump wanted the wall, he'd have negotiated away something of value to get it. Or at least tried to do so. 		He doesn't want the wall. He wants the fight over the wall. He wants to be seen going to war over the wall. That's what tonight is about.

People want meat, they want affordability, but they don't want cruelty. The equilibrium right now is producers hide the cruelty. Better laws and more exposure could push us to an equilibrium of finding ways to produce affordable meat that isn't so cruel.

Anyway, I wouldn't predict too much off one op-ed. But I wouldn't dismiss it either. Romney knew he'd be opening himself to a lot of backlash by writing this. That suggests commitment from a prominent senator who, unlike Flake or Corker, hasn't wrecked his leverage by retiring.
The other thing is: don't underestimate how difficult coordination problems in Congress are. What Romney's doing is making clear that anti-Trump R Senators can coordinate through him at moments of crisis, and that could prove important.
If, say, the Mueller findings are going to lead to congressional action, Senate Republicans willing have to join with Democrats to act. I‚Äôve never thought that particularly likely, but if Romney follows through on the signals he‚Äôs sending here‚Ä¶
