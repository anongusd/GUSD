@MattBinder Barack Obama didn't try to stage a coup in Venezuela. The insane shit that the US did in Chile, Guatemala, etc... doesn't mean that Maduro gets to blame western interference for his political problem. We can understand history without giving dictators a pass.
@MattBinder I'm well aware of the history, which is why I worry about the Trump administration jumping into this and allowing Maduro make the present day situation about America, which it is not.
@robmartinez @bizwiz1980 I don't think Pence jumping into this helps resolve the situation. That is my point.

@noonanjo It's definitely racist! And not a coincidence that this is now happening to a second black candidate.
@noonanjo I agree that there are people who are drawn to conspiracies. But this isn't that. It's a racist attack calling someone other and un-American. That's why it needs to be called out. Otherwise shitheads like Trump make others feel like they have permission to spout these lies.
@noonanjo @stanveuger it was in 2011
@noonanjo I don't agree. This stuff needs to be stamped out. It will not go away.
@noonanjo The birther bullshit started way before Trump - back when it was email forwards. It was fringe. It did not stay on the fringe. Social media supercharges that transfer, and fringe idiots like Jacob Wahl get RTd by the president of the united states.
@noonanjo The same argument was made about the original Obama birther claims, including by Trump. If they aren't addressed and called for what they are - nakedly racist - they will persist and fester.

@AlxThomp It's an important issue and a good scoop, but it reads like state party chairs overreacting to a substantive debate / email and then going public with it because they're pissed at Perez.
@AlxThomp Read the letter. The underlying data issue is very important. The description of it and headline don‚Äôt match the actual tone. For a debate between national political officials that language is pretty tame.
Am I missing something or is this story wildly overwritten? Not a word of Perez's email that's quoted in the piece sounds like he's at "war" with state parties. https://t.co/04Eu7QqA1H

@inkasrain @SuperJewGirl @PodSaveAmerica Totally understand and appreciate the feedback. I would love to hear what you think about the conversation with Dan Shapiro tomorrow. We had much more time to focus on US-Israel policy as opposed to a question or two in a quick phoner
@DanielBShapiro @seffikogen @nathanguttman @PodSavetheWorld Yeah I'm excited for you all to hear the conversation with Dan tomorrow where we go into much more detail on BDS and US/Israel policy generally. I'm not a BDS supporter, but I do think it's appropriate to hear a range of opinion on policy. Some may disagree tho
@inkasrain @SuperJewGirl @PodSaveAmerica I was briefly summarizing BDS as they do it on their website, while also asking her to respond to the charge that its inherently antisemitic. I wanted to hear her case and not fact check w/ my opinion in real time. That said, we discuss in much greater detail on PSTW tmrw.
@seffikogen Look we just disagree. I wanted to hear why she supports BDS. That doesn't mean I support it, but it's not my job to fact check her opinion in real time. You can judge her words. But the nation-state law undercuts your argument here.

@baseballcrank No one is asking them to replace the legal system. Companies fire people for making them look bad all the time. This is just a sequencing issue but ok.
@baseballcrank Companies play judge and jury all the time. What do you think a drug test is. It would be great if every violent offender immediately went to jail. But it‚Äôs bizarre to suggest a team should keep a player with that video evidence while a criminal process goes forward.
@baseballcrank But it should also fall to the team because many people, including some NFL managment, don‚Äôt give a shit about this stuff if you can win games. Hence the Ray Rice fiasco. So the NFL has an even greater obligation than most to crack down hard on these offenses.
@baseballcrank Ok. But i would just suggest to you that the tone of the initial comment made it sound like there was more sympathy for the fans than the victim. Hence the reaction you‚Äôre seeing.
@baseballcrank The cops should arrest him. The team should cut him. I don't get why both isn't the correct answer.

@johnddavidson @TimAlberta @politico His campaign did reach out to Republicans, but he didn't tack to the center like a typical pol. Beto's campaign does not exist as we know it if he's out there saying he'd vote for Brett Kavanaugh and stop kneeling. The honesty propelled him to 4MM votes. Wendy Davis lost by 20%
@TimAlberta @politico You said Bredesen is tied bc of his centrism and Beto is missing his shot by not doing the same. The baked in cynicism drives me crazy. Beto took off because he sounded different, honest, authentic. My problem is suggesting he blew it before any votes are cast based on Roe's #s
@TimAlberta @politico Beto got more total votes than Hillary, but nice try. And smart to suggest Beto should've gone with Phil Bredesen's "smartly packaged centrism" and lost by 10.

@jmartNYT @BetoORourke We do all the time. And we defend moderates when they take shitty votes, but the idea that Beto's fundraising success is somehow an indictment of him, or the result of party elders failing to direct people correctly, is silly. DC elites couldn't stop Bernie's fundraising.
Giving to Beto might be dumb. Texas might be too red. Cruz might win big. But at least Beto is talking about issues in a way that inspires people. We need more, not less, of that kind of politics.
These criticisms of @BetoORourke's fundraising are so stupid. Enthusiasm is not fungible. Small dollar donors don't look around and say, well Manchin is polling in the margin of error so I'll give to him. They see Beto speak forcefully about an issue and get inspired to give.
