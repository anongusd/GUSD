Klopp: "We need to get confidence back in our skills and qualities. Against Aston Villa when this team conceded everything changed."
Jurgen Klopp: "Some things you can change like this (snaps his fingers) ... but to get tuned as a team? That takes time."
Klopp: "I want to see more bravery, more fun in their eyes. I want to see that they like what they do. I saw it this week."
Klopp: "Benteke and Firmino are back on the pitch but not training with the team. I hope they will be back with the team next week."
Klopp: "What a wonderful young boy Gomez is. He has done his ACL. Now we have to wait. He will have surgery. This is his home."
Jurgen Klopp: "Now we have to open our chests and run and fight and shoot and defend together and attack together. Like your best dream!"

Klopp: "I don't read what you write so I am completely free of expectations. Pressure I place on myself is big enough."
Jürgen: "The most important thing now is to train as often and as long as possible and not think about expectations outside." #LFC
Klopp: "It's a funny job to wait for me for 3 hours to take one photo. But it's not a problem. It's okay,"
Jurgen Klopp: "This is not the time to change so much, just to turn the screws a little bit in the right ways."
Kloop "Everything would be better if we had worked together for six weeks but it's not a perfect world."
Klopp: "We've had three excellent training sessions. The boys are willing to listen. It's not the time to change many things."
