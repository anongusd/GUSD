"Geographically, the keys to Democrats’ success came not in the party’s coastal enclaves—such as Rep. Ocasio-Cortez’s district, which was held by Democrats long before she arrived—but rather in the industrial upper Midwest swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania."
"The D electorate in '18—the one that swung House seats &amp; gov offices from R to D—was neither as young nor as lib as popularly imagined...15% of those who voted D last Nov were aged 18—29. The largest contingent of D voters—36%—actually were ages 45—64."https://t.co/QfjLOjaJGS

What helped turn me from an Ayn Rand reader &amp; GOP voter into (I hope) a more tolerant, center-left person were two things: life &amp; education outside the desolate prairie where I mostly grew up (ND), and the patience of liberals who didn’t dismiss me as a friend for my views.
I also experienced personal tribulations that exposed the lie of laissez-faire for what it was: namely, the realization that the privilege of relatives’ wealth afforded me opportunities that are closed to most at birth, and avoid calamities that should have befallen my family.
Then I faced a problem: my zeal for “limited gov’t” was ill-suited for problems, like climate change, that defy market solutions. I still support markets—but also recognize they’re most efficient when paired with healthy, thriving populations that markets alone can’t build up.
This describes me very well. People are often surprised when I tell them I was once a passionate reader of Ayn Rand who was so good at explaining the theoretical case for libertarianism that I made dozens of converts to the cause. https://t.co/1C7XY50kKg

@hmarston4 @MarkWarner @CNASdc Thanks Hunter!
We must confront the reality that our adversaries consider control of information in their borders—something inimical to US laws &amp; values—an essential part of their offensive strategy. We can’t wait for a “digital Pearl Harbor.” We’re already living this reality in a gradual way.
Warner says we must realign our priorities by redirecting some of our defense spending toward cyber and information security. But we also need *presidential* leadership for a true national cyber security doctrine. Only a president can mobilize a truly whole of society approach.
Russia’s defense budget is only $70 billion. Our vastly larger budget is focused on personnel and conventional weapons. But Russia devotes a greater % on cyber &amp; information—recognizing it can’t compete conventionally, but it can w/ information. Warner gets a lot for much less $.
We should use purchasing power of USG to make sure what it buys meet minimum security standards. Companies should also have board members who understand cyber risk. Also, there should be financial penalties on companies like Equifax that fail to take actions to ensure security.
If social media companies don’t address these problems, Congress will be forced to act. Also, the private sector must intensify efforts to enhance data security. For years, USG preferred a light touch approach to this. But while regs can impose costs, inaction can do the same.
There’s nothing wrong in itself with machine generated information. But humans have a right to know if the information to which they are subject on these platforms is coming from a human source or a bot—or from abroad. Look at Honest Ads Act as a bipartisan solution.
This is a solvable problem (see Finland). But here in the US, major social media companies aren’t doing enough to counter Russian exploitation of their platform. He calls out Mark Zuckerberg for first ridiculing the idea of Russian use of his company.
The very day Mark Warner and Marco Rubio led bipartisan efforts to draw attention to this problem across our NATO alliance, Trump appeared alongside Vladimir Putin, to whom he kowtowed.
We must also address disinformation. Russia’s playbook in 2016 involved overt propaganda, funding far right parties, weaponizing leaks—all to undermine faith in our democracy. But this didn’t end in 2016. The threat continues, and is even more acute in developing countries.
But norms aren’t enough. Russia won’t make an about-face on its behavior. Multilateral efforts should also lead to linking specific countermeasures to specific kinds of attacks. We should apply teeth and recruit more countries to deter &amp; punish actors like China and Russia.
We must hold our adversaries accountable by articulating a set of clear expectations when we’ll respond to cyber attacks. We’re allowing other nations to write the playbook. Part of this is because of US inaction. For years the US avoided UN efforts to write international norms.
Warner points out we devoted tremendous resources and efforts to address the threat of terrorism, which was appropriate. But we’ve largely avoided responding to China’s and Russia’s cyber efforts out of a fear of escalation. As a result, it’s been open season for them.
Warner calls out Google for working w/ China’s govt to roll out a censored version of its platform. He notes many private companies are still resistant to large scale reform efforts to address this landscape. He also notes neither Congress nor exec branch are equipped.
Warner points out our adversaries exploit our openness as they integrate info ops into their strategic doctrine. China &amp; Russia operate according to a different playbook. China harnesses the windfalls of the Internet while asserting authority over information in its borders.
Excited to hear @MarkWarner speak on cyberwarfare @CNASdc. He begins by drawing attention to the date – Dec 7, which 77 years ago saw an attack on our nation thanks to an intelligence failure. 2 years ago, another intelligence failure led to another attack on our nation. https://t.co/czZ8GfmE5S

@NateSilver538 I appreciate how much you've hammered home the uncertainty in all of this. I think a year of "blue wave" talk desensitized a lot of Democrats to the possibility that we could have another unexpected outcome.
The Houthis are ruthless, and the Iranians have likely told them to fight to the last man. But Saudi behavior has fixed international attention on Saudi transgressions. It’s frankly a stupid policy and not indicative of astute strategy.
The reason that Saudi Arabia is the no. 3 defense spender in the world is this ruinous war, which costs Riyadh $50 billion per year. This is the brainchild of MBS.
There is a pervasive myth in the Trump administration that a Saudi victory in Yemen would deal a mortal blow to Iran. This is nonsense. Iran wants nothing more than to bog down its no. 1 and no. 2 enemies–Saudi Arabia &amp; UAE–in a war that never ends.
The issue is not future US arms sales to Saudi Arabia, but current sales, especially spare and repair parts. If that flow of weapons was stopped today, tomorrow the Saudi Air Force (in Yemen) would be grounded

I also don’t mind he’s a former Republican (I am a Romney-Clinton voter and now consider myself a Democrat), but other than being anti-Trump (which isn’t the priority of many outstate voters he’d need to court), I’m not sure he’d vote reliably in the Senate.
@_TreyWarren @dbrauer @Tim_Walz Walz has a formidable bio that will serve him well in the general: National Guard, teacher, rural DFL-er. Murphy will struggle outstate. I could have seen myself supporting her, but instead of balancing the ticket she chose a one-term metro legislator to run with her.

However I take issue with this: "Taiwan is to China what Cuba was to the US during the Cold War—a bright red line. It will not tolerate any dilution of America’s 'One China' policy." Actually, our One China policy is deliberately vague. It's not an endorsement of China's version.

This is a great argument, particularly the link between security &amp; governance.

@ViltChamberlain @lindno Sounds great. While y’all are doing that, moderate Democrats are focused on achieving the maximum possible given the structural and political barriers we face to implementing sweeping changes.
@ViltChamberlain The reason I dislike the "look at all these polls showing how popular Medicare for All is" is they don't take into account the fact that popular vote does not determine EC, and rural America is disproportionately represented in Congress. CA gets 2 Senators, so does Wyoming.
@ViltChamberlain Couldn't agree more on popularity of more access to health care. This will be a major turn-out issue for Democrats. We should run on strengthening and improving Ocare, but we cannot force candidates in red districts to take a position that could sink them.
@ViltChamberlain Sure, but so far Medicare for All Democrats haven’t been the ones sweeping primaries around the country. Moderate Democrats have been, so I’m not sure sure Medicare for All is as popular as polls like this suggest in isolation.
@ViltChamberlain Funny thing about stuff like this is that if you tell respondents taxes will have to go up, the results aren’t quite so rosy.

@lindno That's on my long to-read list and I am open to being persuaded otherwise. But in my mind, I think of some things as norms, and others--like blue slips and a 60-vote threshold--as traditions that amplify the power of already disproportionately powerful rural, depopulated states.

@ViltChamberlain @Jorgenlyseng We could all use more thinks.
@ViltChamberlain @Jorgenlyseng @Tim_Walz I don’t think Murphy could win, but I agree, Tim/Peggy will make a fantastic team. If MN becomes a red trifecta this year, it will join the ranks of the red states and probably vote Trump in 2020. The stakes are high and now is not the time for purity fights.
@ViltChamberlain There is no question MN is trending red. But Pawlenty disavowed Trump in 2016, has made millions lobbying for banks since 2012, and left a very poor legacy in 2010. @kkondik moving the needle before the GOP nomination is even settled is premature.
I don’t believe this for a second. https://t.co/QcU6IjmY9I
It's hard to stress how much of a disaster Pawlenty was for Minnesota. He was so awful, he made it easier for Dayton to win in 2010 despite that year's difficult environment for Democrats. Why he thinks his lobbying background will help him in Minnesota, in 2018, is beyond me.
.@TimPawlenty in 2006 was the last Republican to win statewide in MN.

Pompeo will probably be a better manager of the State Dept. He'll take quick steps to build credibility with its workforce. But the focus on process, though important, is missing the forest for the trees. Given his own history &amp; views Pompeo may reinforce Trump's worst instincts.
Recall that as recently as 2016, Pompeo was broadcasting Wikileaks talking points. In October, as CIA Director, his agency had to retract his soft denial of Russian interference. In Congress, he was a major force behind the Benghazi hack job. And he is now our face to the world.
I regret Tillerson's firing. Yes, he made errors, like his hasty State Dept redesign. But in the final analysis--this is a minority view here--he was, with Mattis, an advocate for restraint &amp; continuity in our foreign policy. He was not a puppet for Putin, as some wrongly feared.

@EvanFeigenbaum I don’t think the goal with his observation is to prescribe a course of action but to point out that interconnectivity, while yielding economic dividends, also heightens geopolitical tensions. They’re not mutually exclusive realities.
@ntrickett16 @eric_hontz I think it makes sense and I refer you to Bob Kaplan’s new book, which expounds on that much better than I can.
@eric_hontz You’re rightly focused on an important issue, risk, but the bigger picture point is that the 21st century globalized economy remains highly interconnected and conventional economic thinking endorses this. I don’t agree it’s a vacuous observation but you’re entitled to your views.
@eric_hontz His comment doesn’t imply endorsement or criticism, only that conventional economic thinking endorses trade and financial connectivity.
20 years ago, Kaplan challenged the assumption democracy would win out. Now that he’s been proven right, authoritarianism will have its challenges. China &amp; Russia will face the “Sam Huntington trap” – if institutions don’t advance, a middle class can be politically destabilizing.
There are calls for restraint by US power. But we shouldn’t swing from extremes. We need a sustainable foreign policy, not driven by humanitarian intervention. MacKinder said we are fated to lead because of our geography. We are more trusted, situated between the great oceans.
Because of the ideological threat of world communism, the US remained at arms and tried to foster a liberal world order in Eurasia. That’s now being challenged. History tells us this was an aberration because conflict is normal. But that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t continue.
Our nuclear weapons are symbolic because of the taboo against their use. It’s our naval power that gives us our might. Naval power makes us a liberal trade friendly empire – see Venice and the British Empire. Liberalism, free trade, democracy go naturally with naval power.
What is the US? The last resource rich settlement by Europe in the temperate zone. We’re a great nation not just b/c of our values, but where we geographically are. We are the great satellite continent of Afro-Eurasia, with the greatest ability to influence the old world.
OBOR is China’s attempt to gain Central Asia from Russia. Kaplan observes Putin, an alleged grand strategist, has an obsession with Europe while ceding Central Asia to China. While Russia and China are friends on the surface, beneath are divergences.
Europe’s challenge is a resurgent Russia seeking to subvert and limit democratic governance. While the Warsaw Pact will never be reconstituted, Eastern Europe has rule of law issues emanating from decades of communism. This exposes them to Russian influence and subversion.
MENA is in turmoil bc it has truly entered a post-imperial age. The Ottoman Empire collapsed and the British &amp; French mandates gone. Today these states are no longer dominated by strong leaders the US can deal with – there are many constituencies limiting US ability to influence.
China’s strategy is subtle, comprised of microsteps. This makes any reaction to it by the United States seem like an overreaction. China is now secure on land, giving it the ability to become a sea power again.
The Chinese see the South China Sea the way the United States saw the Caribbean. It allows China to push into the Pacific. It allows it to soften Taiwan. It gives China open access through the Strait of Malacca into the Indian Ocean, becoming a two-ocean navy.
Listening to @CNASdc’s Robert D. Kaplan kick off the Michael J. Zak lecture series on grand strategy. Key insight at the beginning: we are led by finance to think connectivity is a good thing. In geopolitics, it isn’t, because crises in one area can reverberate elsewhere. https://t.co/oJsix5NpAa

Here's a timely addendum: "[Centrist Democrats] too think the Russia investigation deserves attention...but worry that tying it too closely to Trump will politicize the issue in a way that will drive away critical voters." https://t.co/RdjDPwPlBY
For Dems to win, our focus can't be Russia or even Trump alone. Look to how the centrists I list above talk to their voters. They focus on local pocketbook issues. That's the way forward. But that doesn't mean we can't talk about a serious challenge, Russia, at the same time. 8/8
We can debate what effect Russia's activities had in 2016, and yes, many Dems take the Russia-Trump narrative too far. But the Mueller investigation is separate from Russia's broader interference in the West. It's a real issue and deserves serious attention from both parties. 7/8
And what of Russia? Do Democrats like me talk about Russia to malign T's legitimacy? No. Here's why, from DNI Coats: "There should be no doubt that Russia perceived its past efforts as successful &amp; views the 2018 midterm elections as a potential target for...influence ops." 6/8
The obstructionism was staggering: debt ceiling crises, ACA shutdowns, Garland, McConnell's "my #1 priority is making sure president Obama's a one-term president." Add gerrymandering &amp; voter suppression. And *our* disrespect for democratic outcomes has become acute? 5/8
While most Democrats find it hard to accept Trump, if you're going to claim that "of late the problem [of implacable opposition] seems to have intensified," look to 2009-2017, not now. From birtherism to accusations of treason, the GOP &amp; its media allies went off the rails. 4/8
Moreover, the piece gets center-left politics wrong. Outreach to Republicans &amp; disaffected voters is good. But as someone from ND &amp; MN (born in MO), outreach to Republicans is a staple of centrist Dem politics. The idea that this is unique to Sanders &amp; Warren is inaccurate. 3/8
The piece doesn't mention those centrists, but it cites Gillibrand &amp; Schiff. Yes, Gillibrand used to be a Blue Dog, but no longer. Schiff's district is D+23. Their base demands resistance, and they deliver--rightfully so. But the centrists I list above face few such demands. 2/8
A well-written piece, but I'm lost. Who are the center-left Democrats clamoring for impeachment? Is it Heitkamp, Manchin, Tester, McCaskill, or Donnelly? No. While voting D on key bills, they go out of their way to signal openness to working with Trump wherever possible. 1/8 https://t.co/o5XyD0zaxU

@NotConnell @emconnell According to polling, it’s possible for Americans to be pro-DACA and anti-shutdown. I think that has to factor into a minority party’s strategy. Also, national polls don’t reflect numbers in red states and districts that have disproportionate sway in our system.
@emconnell I hear your points, and you raise some very legitimate critiques.
@emconnell I understand the frustration of having to share a political landscape with people who don’t agree with you on everything. Believe me, my life would be easier if everyone always agreed with me.
@emconnell This may have escaped your attention, but Democrats, as the out-of-power party, have no ability to make policy at the moment. We do, however, have the ability to screw up our prospects of recapturing one-half of one branch of government this fall.

Not surprising that popular support for NATO is ticking up in neutral Sweden, which held a massive war game with NATO in Sept. 2017. Russian incursions into Sweden’s air and maritime space have forced it to reconsider its security environment. https://t.co/3dOe2m0JwK

@ViltChamberlain I don’t know the particularities of that race, but what a “reason” for a person in one district to vote for Democrats may not be a reason in another.
@ViltChamberlain Higher in many states and districts than the national average would have you believe.
@ViltChamberlain We should absolutely run aggressively everywhere. But the key lesson is that we have to be a big tent party that does not impose purity tests. What wins elections in MN’s 5th district will not work in its 7th.
@ViltChamberlain When I look at all the progressive jockeying by some of the more obvious primary contenders, I get really worried that they have no clue how underwater they would be in Trump’s America (which, thanks to the EC, could carry him to a second term more easily than people realize).
@ViltChamberlain Still, as VA showed, winning suburbanites wasn’t enough to win the House of Delegates because of gerrymandering and Democratic clustering. On the national level this phenomenon will get even worse, so we can’t just abandon places Trump won to turn out cities and even the suburbs.
@ViltChamberlain Moderate suburbanites are shifting into the blue column when they have a moderate to vote for (eg Doug Jones or Ralph Northam). They do not want far-left progressive candidates.
@ViltChamberlain Yup.		It's my opinion that many national Democrats who counsel that the party resist Trump at all costs and run to the left as much as possible have no clue how decimated the party's brand is in the places we need to win in order to rebuild an electoral majority.

The right wing Polish government is in the midst of an all-out war on history, from erasing Lech Wałęsa’s leading role in Solidarity to criminalizing scholarly discussion of instances of individual Polish collaboration with Germany. This is not what democratic states should do.
But a bill that could criminalize discussion of a fact rooted in scholarship – that plenty of individual Poles collaborated with Nazi Germany, even as many righteous, heroic Poles saved Jews – is a moral stain. No nation should shy away from tough discussions about its history.
For years, Poland’s practice was to have its embassies ask local media not to use terms like “Polish camps” because they left the false impression the camps were run or staffed by Poles. No, in fact many Poles were victims – two of my great-grandfathers, in fact. https://t.co/q3fqhsEcEZ

Indeed, Zeman will win. This isn’t a big surprise as the Czech people have long been among the EU’s most reluctant members.

Sen Schumer made the right call. I care about Dreamers, but the reality is we Dems are out of power, and our one bit of “leverage” – 60 votes in the Senate – can be undone by a simple procedural vote. The longer the shutdown, the greater the risk we lose control of the narrative.

Govt shutdowns, pioneered in the Gingrich era, reflect a flippant attitude toward the State as an enemy of prosperity. We cannot tackle the huge problems facing us if our civic culture doesn’t rediscover trust &amp; enthusiasm for govt as a partner &amp; champion for the private sector.
From the 70s, a concerted effort by corps &amp; their political allies to paint govt as the source of all ills yielded fruit. The right became more and more radical in its denunciation of the state, leading to amnesia about the programs, laws &amp; norms that created the middle class.
What’s even more remarkable than that, however, is that Americans, including titans of industry, once accepted &amp; celebrated govt. Contrast George Romney’s approach to unions &amp; wages to Mitt Romney’s. The poison of Ayn Rand took hold &amp; tarnished the very idea of govt on the right.
Yes, private initiative is essential to our story. But it was the “effective governance” of our mixed economy that made huge leaps in education, sanitation, health, infrastructure &amp; scientific R&amp;D possible. These building blocks didn’t come from the market. They came from govt.
The book shows that while govt is vilified on the right–which perpetuates a myth of unbridled capitalism as the source of our success–it wasn’t always this way. For much of the 20th cent, Americans across the spectrum celebrated govt’s role in laying our prosperity’s foundations.
In the early hours of this govt shutdown, I’ve been reflecting a lot on one of the most influential books I’ve read: “American Amnesia,” by Jacob Hacker &amp; Paul Pierson. Its basic idea is that active government allowed America’s private economy to flourish. https://t.co/ACZgTDJr5k

If Warsaw gets away with putting Poland’s courts under flagrantly partisan control, the EU will not be able to credibly enforce its foundational commitment to the rule of law in any other member state–a dangerous precedent.
Poland’s new PM will go to great lengths to offer Brussels every manner of cosmetic change to placate those who fear that the rule of law is endangered in Warsaw. But the EU shouldn’t be fooled: while Morawiecki is PM, party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski is still the country’s ruler.
However, as Slawomir Sierakowski has pointed out, the EU has a lot of leverage with Orban, who has vowed to block sanctions against Warsaw, because his economy is even more dependent on trade links with the rest of Europe than Poland is. https://t.co/TXkTEJX7U3
@FT Some crucial points: yes, Poland is where Europe’s most important showdown with populism is taking place. But the EU may find its options are limited, in part b/c Germany is hesitant to push Poland too hard, and Poland can plausibly complain about double standards from Brussels.

It's too early to talk about '20 and who knows, maybe tmrw Oprah will dismiss all this speculation and we'll forget about it. But the DC world has failed to learn a lesson of '16: voters want inspiration &amp; narrative just as much as policy. We shouldn't casually dismiss Oprah '20.
A good president has to be smart, hire well, and seek out counsel. But the sausage making of policy doesn't happen at the presidential level. Presidents shape policy through their unique ability to convene and build consensus. Oprah would be hugely successful at this.
Is Trump an unmitigated disaster because he has no experience? No. In fact, if anything, his lack of experience and his ineptness (as well as that of his staff) have saved us from a scenario where he could implement the fullest extent of what he said he wanted to.
GWB had executive experience as a governor, but was a total disaster of a president. One could argue Clinton's and Bush 43's experience served them well, but they were also fortunate to inherit a post-Soviet international order, while Clinton benefited from the dot-com boom.
From the vantage point of policy, have the most experienced presidents been the most effective policymakers? When he wasn't sabotaged by a GOP Congress, Obama notched significant domestic and foreign achievements despite not having even completed a Senate term.
Lots of DC folks are expressing strong opposition to the idea of Oprah running b/c, inter alia, a president is supposed to have experience. But does experience matter?

@ViltChamberlain If AL Dems say would benefit from help of nat'l Dems, then OK but GOP has been successful sinking local Dems by linking them to nat'l party.
@ViltChamberlain We have 10 Democratic senators to defend in states that Trump won. My personal view is that our resources should be sent there.
@ViltChamberlain Poll out today showing Jones &amp; Moore off by 6 pts also says vtrs largely approve of Trump so won't take much for Moore to lock down base.

@lindno I'd be curious to see if that trend is concentrated in places like CA or in states with a disproportionate weight in the Electoral College.
@_BenSand Not necessarily. Plenty of Repubs preferred a different nominee the first time but got in line when faced with a choice of him or HRC.
