Just, for the love of God, please decide on something by Friday...Getting really tired of these children's games... https://t.co/zj8Ungi6P9

I want to update this now that I know a lot more about it - there is a lot of BS in the #GreenNewDeal . SOME of the ideas are good, and if they took those good ideas and did a little bit at a time, I think they could actually get somewhere with it, but I doubt that will happen.
The more I hear about the #GreenNewDeal , the more ridiculous it sounds. I don't see how anyone could possibly think this is a good idea. If Democrats really want to make a difference in the environment, they need to start small. Republicans aren't going to vote for this stuff.
@DailyMirror Why is this news???
@thewillwitt I think maybe if you reworded the question a little, your results would lean more on "yes". Some people might assume you are asking if they believe humans evolved from apes, specifically, since that's usually the big argument.

@RepMullin just spilled some major tea all over the Democrats on immigration! Good on you for calling them out! It's so sad that they use these children for their own political gain. The hypocrisy is unreal. #migrantfamilyseparationpolicy #cspan #micdrop #immigration

@TahitiPlumeria @NBCNews @NBCNewsBETTER I agree
@NBCNews @NBCNewsBETTER This stuff is far too expensive to throw out so often....
I am not opposed to the ideas in the #GreenNewDeal , but I think it's far too much to focus on at once. If the GND was simplified a bit, I think it's a great idea.
I'm all for awarding Aretha Franklin. She has made wonderful contributions to American culture....But do you really think this is the right time, Ms. Harris? Especially during all the shutdown/wall commotion? This can wait. https://t.co/9KsCLUU7fy

I like what you have to say, Mr. Delaney. Let's hope you can back that up. https://t.co/Q1wQDxpnJx
@CoryBooker Mr. Booker, I sincerely want to ask - what is he doing to drive US citizens apart from each other? Most of the division I've seen has come from party tribalism and placing labels on one another, none of which he has encouraged from what I can see.
@RubinReport Is this picture real??? Are they really that muscular?
Diversity means very little in this situation when Democrats couldn't even behave themselves during the SotU address (especially Pelosi) https://t.co/gAmif4U5Sk
They can't stand the idea of agreeing with Trump, even if it's something they have continually advocated for. :/ https://t.co/WKpq92ECnh
Bullshit! https://t.co/zA9pL5KAO1
@thehill Bit arrogant isn't it?
Well at least he had something nice to say. Hopefully it was sincere. https://t.co/in5Iqf4L0r

I've ever seen anyone appear to be so smug and full of hate as Pelosi looks during the SotU address. It reminds me of in high school when a girl will be giving a presentation and the bitches in the back are giving her these types of looks. Hardly professional. #GrowUpPelosi
I appreciate someone voting the way they believe is right rather than just following the rest of the party, and I don't even agree with her opinion. https://t.co/2nzUmCXFrj
@DailyMirror Why is this news?
It is honestly so scary how many people will just follow others blindly and then get mad when you tell them to form their own opinions. If you think politicians and churches don't have hidden agendas, think again. #educateyourself #dontbeasheep #antigroupthink
https://t.co/x4DOivnH5f I really like his point because it is rooted in logic and not in religion. So many pro-lifers will scream "THE BIBLE SAYS!" until they're blue in the face, but I seldom see any good points like this one. #abortion #jameslankford #prolife #PlannedParenthood

(2/2) A president who cares about the people does not override Congress all the time the way he does. He wants everything HIS way. It's not about political sides at this point. ANY leader who thinks he is above the law and the democratic processes of this country is harmful.
(1/2) He never gave up his  billionaire lifestyle. He still IS a billionaire. I think it's important to consider that there are other reasons that someone might leave a  cushy lifestyle to be put in a position like this, power being the biggest. https://t.co/4nAvuqbg4l
