Farming groups have joined hundreds of other business groups in calling on Trump to stop the tariffs that have lost them money and the ability to globally compete. They aren't mincing words about their struggles.
Farmers are getting hurt and they keep telling Trump to stop the tariffs. Trump says they don't mind getting hurt.
Tariffs aren't going to load up the Treasury with cash. Car tariffs will cost Americans much more per car.
And yet, Canada did sign the 12-nation TPP. So clearly they are willing to make trade deals.
Trump says he's very unhappy with the US-Can NAFTA negotiations and the "negotiating style" of Canada and "we don't like their representative very much." Yikes. Ask anyone who worked on TPP, Canada is extremely meticulous and they are tough negotiators.
But Trudeau said their schedules were too busy and he wanted to talk to other leaders who he speaks to less often.
Trump says he rejected a meeting with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau because "his tariffs are too high and he doesn't seem to want to move and I told him forget about it, and frankly we're thinking about just taxing cars coming in from Canada, that's the motherlode that's the big one
