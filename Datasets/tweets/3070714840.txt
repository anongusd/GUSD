We've learned a lot about how discrimination operates in today's workplace since laws were passed 55 years ago.The #PaycheckFairness Act is  a commonsense update that would give women new tools to combat the ongoing wage gap. I applaud the House for committing to move it swiftly.

The new census data confirms that the gender pay gap persists in every state and in virtually every occupation and congressional district.  This doesn't add up for working families.  It is just common cents to close the pay gap. Take action: https://t.co/uE14mAyR3y
@AAUW's research shows that 74.5% of Congressional districts with gender pay gaps wider than the national average are represented by Members of Congress who are not cosponsors of the #PaycheckFairnessAct.  We need stronger tools to challenge the gap. https://t.co/uE14mAyR3y
The #paygap is persistent. It's not going away and is getting wider for many women of color. We need real tools, like the #PaycheckFairnessAct and the @EEOC's critical pay data collection, which would help identify trends of pay discrimination based on sex, race &amp; ethnicity.
