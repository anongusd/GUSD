@TxEx @rch371 Totally different topic, but here's my answer. I have no doubt that if national defense was market based then innovation would be improved &amp; spending decreased. However with the weapons/force involved, sacrificing efficiency to gain elected leader oversight is a price we must pay
@TxEx @rch371 I'm not sure what's unlikely, there are always better solutions out there. They will find something that is cleaner, and that's cheaper as well.  Simple as that
@CoreyWFrate @QueenMab87 I see you provide zero examples... I tend to like sound logic
@Corbinburnsin @QueenMab87 Certainly neither of you are my teacher, that's for sure. I just hope you reconsider.. Claiming victim-hood or encouraging others to do so does not actually help the situation. It can be completely devastating to teach people they are helpless in a society that's out to get them
#FakeNews https://t.co/iQmMyxEizM
@TxEx @rch371 If it benefits society, people are willing to pay for it.  Millions of bright minds are motivated to solve this problem, they will find a solution that creates a profit motive.
@Corbinburnsin @QueenMab87 Would love for you to point out a single thing in the video that is factually incorrect
@QueenMab87 Since we're using caps.., THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF SYSTEMIC OPPRESSION!  If you can point out SPECIFIC instances of oppression to me, I'd be right by your side fighting for justice.
@TxEx @rch371 Correct. If you find a better, cleaner, more efficient solution, the market moves towards that solution (eg natural gas). Lots of money in energy, so lots of potential rewards. Engineers can find energy storage solutions for for wind/solar/etc. or something new (eg Fusion power)

@TxEx @rch371 No. Capitalism has solved/is solving all kinds of other major world problems and it can fix this too.  		Perhaps when Democrats tried to "fix" our healthcare system by creating Obamacare would be a situation more relevant to your assessment

@Mattielisbon @AndrewFrisbie05 @renovacion @SenSanders One simple answer to explain the situation in each and every country?  That's the best you got?? Convenient to confirm your bias and keep you from actually doing research or learning
@AndrewFrisbie05 @renovacion @Mattielisbon @SenSanders Uhhh huh??  If you love socialism and Venezuela so much you're more than welcome to move there if you'd like (One of the great freedoms of the US to do whatever you want if you aren't hurting others)
@BigM85149150 @SenSanders I believe what you are referring to is called giving/donating/charity, which is a much better thing than stealing (aka taxing).  If you're able to do that and actually DO give, it's a great thing and makes the world a better place :)

@AOC We're literally living in the greatest time in human history... Thanks to capitalism... Which you're trying to destroy...
@kathygriffin You act like a 10 year old child.. How about an apology for your disgusting behavior instead of hurling out more hateful insults?  Calling for the doxing of a minor is completely abhorrent and you show no remorse.  Should maybe spend some reflection time on a few recent decisions
For anyone wanting fair and honest news on a daily basis, I would HIGHLY recommend The Ben Shapiro Show podcast by @benshapiro. Great and entertaining way to get your news, and hard to argue with his facts! @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats you could learn a thing or two &amp; maybe @MAGA!
RT @benshapiro: Kevin Hart should introduce Trump for the State of the Union Address from Covington High.
@Alyssa_Milano Hard to tell if this is shear ignorance or just more liberal propaganda.  Racism has no place in this country, has no connection to political party, and is simply thrown out as an insult by those that are not capable of debating with facts.
Dems say every word spoken by a leader matters, and are quick to go after @POTUS.  If this is true, how can you defend @AOC?  Not helpful to lie about or exaggerate climate change, and maybe talk to some veterans before claiming ‚ÄúLike, this is our World War II."  So disgraceful!
@CuomoPrimeTime @CNN Instead of a 5 minute piece on how this is somehow the fault of @POTUS and how upset you are at a red hat, how about an apology for this network slandering a 16 year old minor and continuing to push misleading headlines at the expense of everyone in this country?
