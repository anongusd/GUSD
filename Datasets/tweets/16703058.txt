@mrmatthewsjbhs Isn't it described today as a college readiness test?
@mrmatthewsjbhs And I took the Scholastic Aptitude Test 60 years ago. Over 20 years ago SAT scores stopped being accepted for high IQ societies probable because their correlation with IQ measures became too low.
@mrmatthewsjbhs https://t.co/umZ3tJHBUV
@mrmatthewsjbhs We're both sort of right. I took the SAT in 1959. SAT used to stand for Scholastic Aptitude Test, but now it doesn't. Before certain years composite SAT scores may be used for admission to High IQ societies, but no longer.
@Imperator383 @Steven_Swenson I'm not advocating group immigration. Group characteristics are not those of individual members, but of the group. If assimilation occurs, new immigrants will no longer group together either.
@mrmatthewsjbhs Ignoramus! S. A. T. == Scholastic APTITUDE Test. They have a lot of actual achievement tests BTW.  The GRE is considered an aptitude test.  You can use GRE scores to get into Mensa and other high IQ societies.  My GRE's are 770, Quantitative; 790, Verbal. 97th &amp; 99th Percentile.
@Imperator383 @Steven_Swenson Exactly right. Granted. But what do we do with that information? Christians will tend towards much different answers than Pagans such as yourself.

@Imperator383 @Steven_Swenson It strikes me that the US has the knack of assimilation and that many immigrants have in the past had that goal as well. Somali immigrants to the US not so much. Europe does poorly in assimilation of emmigrants .How does the UK fare in that regard in comparison to UK &amp; EU?
@Imperator383 @Steven_Swenson Based on their culture, religion, &amp; language I agree, just not on their race. Without great commonality in culture &amp; religion, unproductive conflict may easily arise. A common language his however even more vital. As to skin color &amp; facial characteristics, I have a broad esthetic
@mrmatthewsjbhs Yes, they are culturally biased because their originators had a culture. But the significance of that fact for various purposes requires more information on the particular quality under consideration.
@mrmatthewsjbhs The dogna is that general IQ may not be improved. I find this contention implausible. Valid for what? As a predictor of academic performance, SAT's, GRE's &amp; IQ scores are excellent. My GRE's exceeded my SAT's significantly &amp; reversed the predominance of quantitative over verbal.
@Imperator383 @Steven_Swenson The differences do matter, just not in questions of right &amp; duty (i.e. of justice).
@Imperator383 @Steven_Swenson A little investigation reveals that gonadal genes are unique to male mammals. Also in X chromosome pairs in females, only 1 is active. This might augur for even more extremes in females than males except for one thing, females are typically a mosaic of one or the other as active.
@Imperator383 @Steven_Swenson But there is another category of sex-linked characteristics, Y-only genes if they exist.
@Imperator383 @Steven_Swenson That is usually only for sex-linked characteristics where lacking the masking effect of a corresponding gene on a male's X chromosome, the recessive/dominant distinction vanishes.
@Imperator383 @Steven_Swenson Differences in kind not just quantity of general intelligence appear by my theoretical math example to be very important whether race or gender're in consideration. Females they say excel in the verbal. I never noticed this since my verbal IQ is 15 points higher than quantitative
@Imperator383 @Steven_Swenson This's a point applying to gender differences too. Theoretical mathematics (NOT ARITHMETIC) requires exceptional excellence in abstract capability. The 2% IQ difference between the genders is too small to account for the extreme paucity of accomplished female mathematicians.
@Imperator383 @Steven_Swenson It could still be culture. Probably both. Diversity has a lot of costs. A stultifying uniformity has other costs.
@Imperator383 @Steven_Swenson Good point. The dominant/recessive quality cuts both ways for outbreeding and inbreeding.
@Imperator383 @Steven_Swenson That's right. A tree-structured conversation is potentially competent to manage diverse topics in a single convo.
@mrmatthewsjbhs Cultures do nothing. They are not persons. What part of that is unclear to you?
@mrmatthewsjbhs They are highly correlated. Artificial restrictions on using IQ tests are easily evaded. As an employer, I used none of these measures. Instead, I wanted to see a current or past essay analyzing an issue of the prospective employee's choice, which was revealing in several ways.
@Imperator383 @Steven_Swenson Yes, but of course inbreeding causes deterioration in a population. Take two highly inbred lines, breed them and the results are dramatic. If highly desirable &amp; undesirable characteristics are largely dominant, the results are even better.
@Imperator383 @Steven_Swenson I didn't say unlimited merit-based immigration. Should we consider factors such as language, religion &amp; culture? I say so. Race no.
@Imperator383 @Steven_Swenson Ever heard of "hybrid vigor?" Perhaps racial mixing has its positive components. It's worth considering.
@Imperator383 @Steven_Swenson Our conclusion is different. At the AIP we welcome merit-based LEGAL immigration regardless of origin. Trump's economic boom has created a labor shortage in many categories.
@Imperator383 @Steven_Swenson Your hypothesis could be tested by looking at the correlation of IQ with % of Sub Saharan ancestry. Has anyone done this?
@Imperator383 @Steven_Swenson Migrations are commonplace in history. With the improvement in transportation, individual volition in such matters becomes more important.
@Imperator383 @Steven_Swenson Are we veering into a discussion of immigration policy?
@Glaivester @Steven_Swenson @Imperator383 Yes, studies of such things should take relevant individual dirrerences into account for sure.
@Imperator383 @Steven_Swenson I associated with a man who by appearance is likely of relatively pure SubSaharan ancestry, Alan Keyes. Absolutely brilliant. When HE said I was very bright, I was very complimented, I can tell you.
@Imperator383 @atulsingh74 Culturally it mitigates against creativity. Does that explain why the Chinese &amp; Japanese have to steal so much tech?
@Imperator383 @Steven_Swenson White Iowans, 120.
@Imperator383 @atulsingh74 Yes. I always thought that. My proposal, have the really bright devise a test for the even brighter. We must make do with what is at hand., LOL.
@mrmatthewsjbhs They just do better. Culture or "general IQ?" I don't know. I just treat folks according to their individual characteristics. Harvard discriminates against Asians perhaps using your excuse.
@Imperator383 @Steven_Swenson But the question is what do you do with your "facts?" Do you conclude that uniform group treatment of all individuals in said group is just &amp; wise?
@Steven_Swenson @Imperator383 Yes, indeed there are. We got rid of slavery while at the very same time believing in the inferiority of the slave. We did so on grounds of liberty &amp; justice &amp; individual accountability &amp; reward, not average group characteristics.
@krizzy52 @Imperator383 So I ask you did the 160+ IQ get in the way of common sense or not? I note your generalization was not absolute. I dispute it even so. Studies show that smarts benefit even ditch digging by 30% more effectiveness. Politicians &amp; even more so captains of industry are usually bright
@krizzy52 @Imperator383 sraying == spraying. I yelled stop that. They obeyed. I turned my head &amp; said, "Get a shovel" to the kid. I then instructed them to smother the fire with dirt. They did using the shovel I'd sent for &amp; other tools at hand. By the time the firemen arrived, the fire was largely out.
@krizzy52 @Imperator383 The householder &amp; son were sraying water on the fire with garden hoses. All they were doing was fanning the flames. The more vigourously they sprayed the flames, the more they whooshed up &amp; spread the flamable material I was momentarily stunned by the stupidity, but recovered...
@krizzy52 @Imperator383 Rather than being merely offended, I'll tell you a story. I was tutoring a volunteer firefighter's son. The squawk box came on alerting a fire next door. The kid &amp; I rushed out to see an open garage on fire due to an electrical short &amp; gasoline stored there. ...

@Imperator383 Well, let's see. How deliciously offensive is your new background? What is that a map of?
@Imperator383 But according to the evil #SCOTUS doctrine that says religion is a matter of belief only, none of those acts in accord with religious precepts are protected in the slightest from state regulation. No protection for atheists' acts either, just for atheism as a belief. #MAGA #ccot
@3ridersNOVA That is because the imagined US Constitution's "Free Exercise of Religion Clause" is vitiated by the evil #SCOTUS doctrines of belief only religion and "compelling state interest." IMHO not Constitutionally guaranteed, but definitely an example of religious free exercise denied.
@cu_mr2ducks Jesus himself called faith itself a sort of work, but a very easy one. Both Old &amp; New Covenants are conditional. They must be accepted in order to go into effect between the parties. The New Covenant is a gift "contract." Even gifts have 2 sides. Gifts require consent to receive.
@alexruthrauff The socalled "Free Exercise Clause" is in my opinion, not a separate clause at all, but rather a part of the "Estacblishment Clause" which foreclosed any backdoor attempts to allow the US to regulate State religious establishments. #MAGA #ccot #tcot #teaparty #Trump2020
@alexruthrauff I'm not in favor or religious establishments at the State or US Government levels. HOWEVER, when the Establishment Clause was proposed &amp; ratified there were 6 State establishments of religion which the 1A protected &amp; which disappeared on their own. #MAGA #tcot #ccot #teaparty

@alexruthrauff Transliterate "an establishment of religion" to "a religious establishment" in the 1A and the "clause" refers to the free exercise of a religious establishment, which reinforces the non-interference with such an establishment. I believe this to be the true meaning. #MAGA #ccot
@Imperator383 Yes, a claim that one's free exercise of religion is impaired must be supported by some evidence that the religion you claim is really in some substantial sense yours. #MAGA #ccot #tcot #teaparty #Trump2020
@Supply4Survival Yes, Humanity as a whole is on Death Row. A little-appreciated self-evident truth.

@wendymp Jesus said, "If you love me, obey my Words." Of course, we BELIEVE those words/sayings/precepts/commands. So this links love, belief, and obedience. #ccot
@ChaplainDM That may be, but does the Constitution allow Congress to make a law making that distinction? If the "thereof" refers to religion in the generic sense, I think not. If this is inconvenient (and it is), then it is a subject for amendment, not tortured interpretation. #MAGA #ccot

@truckrogers1 IDK. Not enough googling around?
@Alielbaryeshua Paul was a sinner as he admited. Jesus was not. Nothing I said would rationally lead you to conclude I said or thought so. So I find you confused &amp; prone to jump to conclusions.
@unblock_list what blocktogether lists am I on?
@ReneeBlythe I'll keep asking until I am sure the question is understood. How do you define religion?
@8cho5inco Grace through faith does not imply that virtuous actions are irrelevant. The MOTIVE is different after accepting the proffered certain, permanent salvation. The motive is love and gratitude. AND there are rewards for obedience, but ONLY after accepting absolute Grace.
It's appalling that about half the respondents to this poll, believe that religion is conducted merely in your head and has no relevance to action. This is entirely contrary to Christian beliefs. If you hold this view, I question whether you have ANY religion! Give me your views!
@Alielbaryeshua Thanks for refining my vocabulary! The only restriction of polygyny in the Old Covenant was Kings of Israel not have "many" wives.

@gillianbdoll intentially ==&gt; intentionally.
@gillianbdoll It is not misleading. It intends to make a necessary distinction as a basis for a reinterpretation. And yes you insulted me. "Intentionally obtuse?" If you say I am intentionally obtuse, doesn't THAT bespeak an elitist attitude?
@gillianbdoll Here is the article you should read carefully: https://t.co/4FuC6ZMu3q
@gillianbdoll 12 Amendments not the Twelth Amemdment.
@gillianbdoll Did you know that Congress proposed 12 amendments for ratification only the LAST 10 of which became "The Bill of Rights?" Are you being intentially ignorant?
@OptimisticCon The issue is State vs. Federal power. The issue is whether the US can prohibit polygamy in its territories. The issue is whether free exercise is a wimpy free exercise or robust action-oriented free exercise. The issue is whether States may protect us against radical Islam. #MAGA
@gillianbdoll It was actually the 3rd article of the 12 proposed to the States. So it was 3rd most important by this reasoning. The 2 most "important" ones failed of ratification until, proposed Amendment 2 became the 27th Amendment ratified. The 1st still hasn't been ratified.
@Budjovi Polygamy is a religious practice. Prohibiting it prohibits in that respect the free exercise of the original Mormon religion &amp; the current Islamic religion. Your silly idea would allow the prohibition of all religious exercises of a religion but not, therefore, the religion?
The 1st "free exercise" case Reynolds v. US was decided correctly but for the wrong reasons. It allowed prohibition of polygamy in US territories. Yes, the US may prohibit free exercise of religion in its territories just as States may do in their establishments of religion #MAGA
@LivingstonChamp @FinleyElane And BTW I do not hold with the Sherbert Test or the Smith decision. Religion is worthless unless it extends to act as well as thought. Whenever I see the "compelling state interest" phrase, I am sure that my liberties are about to be restricted improperly.  #MAGA #tcot #ccot
@ebysports @FinleyElane What if it read "Congress shall make no law respecting a house of disrepute, or prohibiting the free entry thereof;"? What does the "thereof" refer to in this case?
@OptimisticCon How is religion exercised in an establishment of religion? I'll tell you how, collectively as prescribed by that religion and by the government that "established" it, not by the individual.
@gillianbdoll And also as one of the 12 amendments submitted to the States by Congress just before that.
@gillianbdoll It doesn't say the free exercise of religion. You made an edit.
@ebysports @FinleyElane No, like a historian. Tell me how many States had establishments of religion at the time of the ratification of the 1stA?
@LivingstonChamp @FinleyElane So in YOUR opinion, the Constitution is a suicide pact?!
@gillianbdoll No. Read it.
@OptimisticCon What does the "thereof" refer to? To "religion or "an establishment of religion?" In English grammar the reference is ambiguous. We are left with the sense of the matter in deciding which reference was meant.
RT @JulianSvendsen: @realDonaldTrump Do you support our POTUS? (Please help by retweeting and following after voting!) https://t.co/o8MaDtV‚Ä¶
@LivingstonChamp @FinleyElane Yes, banned without reference to religion, but it does prohibit a practice permitted by many religions' scriptures. The general prohibition of the practice does not change its character as a prohibition of free exercise. It kept Mormons from establishing a State for a while.
@LivingstonChamp @FinleyElane Polygamy is banned throughout the US. It is permissible according to Jewish, Christian and Islamic Scriptures. It's status IMHO is a Jewish &amp; Christian custom, not a religious obligation.
@realkerryfrench "free exercise thereof" is the only Constitutional context in which "free exercise appears."

Establishments of religion prohibit. free exercise of religion. "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;" This protects State establishments of religion &amp; their freedom to restrict the free exercise of religion.
@FinleyElane The "thereof" refers to the free exercise of an establishment of religion which by its very nature restricts the free exercise of religion to the extent that it is an establishment of religion. States can protect us against Islam therefore. but Congress cannot. #MAGA #ccot #tcot

Hebrews 10:24-25 And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another--and all the more as you see the Day approaching. #ccot
Finally, would it be permissible for Christians to abandon assembling together for all the many beneficial, convenient and mandatory reasons since regularity in the same is not commanded? NOT AT ALL! #ccot
Moreover, should we have great battles over such matters? Divide into Denominations over them? Make them part of necessities for Salvation even? ABSOLUTELY NOT! #ccot Romans Chapter 14, all of it.
So then Brothers and Sisters, what are we to conclude, that we should NOT meet regularly on some day of the week? Of course not, but we should recognize that this a matter of convenience, not obligation. #ccot
Colossians 2:16 Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day. #ccot I generalize this to ANY regular observance, weekly or yearly.
So what should we do if someone tries to tell Christians we MUST meet regularly and that on Sunday or Saturday (Sabbath)? We should RESIST them by a clear command. Colossians 2:16. #ccot
Customs, for instance, monogamy, are often very beneficial (original pattern according to Jesus), but they are CUSTOMS not commands, a very NECESSARY distinction. #ccot
So does this lack of evidence mean we are WRONG to meet for fellowship, sermons,  collections, worship, teaching, meals, baptisms, Lord's Supper, etc on Sunday? NOT AT ALL! It is a fine custom, very convenient &amp; beneficial. #ccot
Whenever it started, the sermon continued until midnight, so it was probably a long one by today's standards. In conjunction with this event, Paul collected funds for the poor persecuted member of the Jerusalem Church. #ccot
Acts 20:7  &amp; upon the 1st day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread Paul preached to them, ready to depart on the morrow; &amp; continued his speech until midnight. #ccot		Bread was broken at EVERY meal, not just special occasions. No time of day indicated.
I find no pattern of sermons on the 1st day of the week except for one example of a collection and sermon which lasted from the breaking of bread till midnight! Quite an example! Are you pastors prepared to emulate it on a regular basis?! See the following: #ccot
I find no guidance in the Scriptures on which day of the week Christians should gather for anything. I do see an example of collecting funds for the poor on Sunday, twice, but no command to do it on that day. #ccot

It seems in the New Year I'm getting about half the impressions I usually do. Am I being throttled down by #Twitter, is everyone taking a break, or is less Twitter a favorite New Year's resolution? #MAGA #tcot #ccot #teaparty #twisters #Trump2020  #TrumpTrain #ocra #tgdn
The 1st 2 of the 3 requirements to be a member of the #HouseofRepresentatives may be met by the date of taking office since they can be forseen, but being an inhabitant of the State in which district to be represented lies MUST BE TRUE ON ELECTION DAY for a qualified choice #MAGA

The AIP failed to enlist any Congressional support for preventing a DC area inhabitant from taking office in the #HouseofRepresentatives. The truth is most #CongressScum have a Beltway mentality &amp; are not in sympathy with the districts they purport to represent. #MAGA #tcot #ccot
#Trump said he was for every nation's sovereignty not just ours. To be consistent he must support nationhood for the #Kurds. WE OWE THEM THAT TOO! Also no more #SecurityCouncil ordering sovereign nations around. The Security Council institutionalizes international bullying. #MAGA
I will never sport a #KAG on tweet or bio profile except to point out that WE CANNOT BE GREAT AGAIN UNTIL ALL OF THE NEW DEAL &amp; OTHER ENTITLEMENTS ARE OFF THE GOVERNMENT BOOKS! Restore the Constitution! #MAGA #tcot #ccot #teaparty #Trump2020

I've been struggling to get Congressmen to step up and honor their Constitutional oath for several days now. I'm beginning to realize what those pikes on top of Trimp's Great Wall are really for.
@Tea4gunsSC Only because, direct practical solutions are customarily avoided. They can be deprived of their liberty by due process &amp; sentenced to hard labor of this sort. Eminently Constitutional &amp; not a 13th Amendment violation.
Rory, heads up. I emailed you our press release which includes our appeal for some Congressman to step up &amp; object to absentee representation. for CA CD 21. @RoryDoesPhonics
We need a resolution to NOT seat a MD resident at the time of election to the 21st CA Congressional district. The American Independent Party of CA has proof. Can you help? We'll send all the material if you'll give us the email of a staffer https://t.co/22wkB00A6R @RepByrne #MAGA
@Tea4gunsSC They can provide labor for building the wall.
I urgently need the email addresses of US Congressional Representatives. Somebody please help me. If you send me even one address, I'll send you the message &amp; evidence calling for a Constitutionally unqualified person elected to the House not to be seated. markyavelli@gmail.com

@StevenM21944526 @Orgleader @_RichardHall I'm just concerned that the "Q" phenomenon is advancing yet another conspiracy theory (they are real but intrinsically difficult to prove) and a confidence in a false prophet that encourages blind belief, perhaps even a complacent triumphalism.
@OneOldAmerican @Dialmond We are gathering the evidence. A Congressman will have to raise the issue. We will present it to any Congressman who will challenge the "victor's" qualifications. If you know a Congressman who could be interested in this, please let us know

@kgal1298 @erika_petersen @sentientdreamer @EmmanuelMacron He is one of many. It was not, however, nationalism in general, but German nationalism that he promoted. But so what? Promoting his own nation did not make him in any way unique. Other things did, but not that.
The roots of the current "War on Terror," Radical Islamic Extremism, Islamic Imperialism can not only be traced to Islam's beginnings &amp; successive ISLAMIC EMPIRES called Caliphates, but to as recently as World War I's destruction of the Ottoman Empire. #MAGA #tcot #teaparty #ccot https://t.co/qMCjZHAANM

@Achille95924764 How do you know so much you do not or could not know? Truly, you are the marvel of the age.
@Rubyxx It is an attempt to illustrate that one must be able to do good to oneself as a necessary preliminary to doing goood to others. It is the well off who are able to do substantial charitable acts, not those who struggle just to make ends meet.
@Rubyxx How much Native American does it take to be one? Is it genetics, or culture or politics? Give me one example of a current Native American and I will discuss him or her and his or her situation.
@Rubyxx I expect patriotism is more difficult when your country has wounded you. That is why we should focus on political ideals and their realization thru just and lawful means.
@Rubyxx You will never achieve a broad perspective without a knowledge of history. Do you believe that the significance of The Great War was just so a century later national leaders could harangue each other for political advantage?

Almost every Dominant Empire in its era aspired to WORLD EMPIRE. The United Nations attempted to establish a democratically organized World Empire comprised of a mixed multitude of socialist, democratic &amp; autocratic regimes all dominated by 5 bullies on the Security Council #MAGA
World War 2 put the quietus to the blooming European Colonial Empires. The historical blindness that ignores this struggle between NATIONHOOD &amp; EMPIRE deserves an explanation. Consider the UNITED NATIONS.
The dissolution of the Evil Empire (Soviet Union) left a residual, shrunken Russian Empire, many Eastern European nations restored to full sovereignty as independent nations and a passel of Islamic "Republics" ripe for unification in a resurgent, greater Islamic Caliphate. #MAGA

@EmmanuelMacron But did you ever hear the saying, "Charity begins at home." But it doesn't end there. Love yourself first indeed, then love others like that. Without the first, self-love, there is no basis for comparison in the phrase, "Love your neighbor as yourself." #Macron #MAGA #tcot #ccot

#Macron is entitled to support the muting of French sovereignty in favor of the EU, which I characterize as an undemocratic union of democratic states. Calling a preference for full national sovereignty a BETRAYAL of patriotism is HIGHLY INSULTING, more so than his prior remarks.

When #Macron attacks "nationalism" as antithetical to "patriotism," if he's referring to #Trump (&amp; he clearly was), then he's attacking a straw man. Trump gave us his definition of nationalism as regard for national independence &amp; sovereignty, equivalent to patriotism #MAGA #tcot

Patriotism's defined as a love of country, where "country" may be taken broadly to mean both land &amp; people or more narrowly to mean the land, people &amp; their government. Nationalism is usually defined as what may be called excessive patriotism, asserting your nations preeminence.
Let's explore the definitions of "nationalism" and "patriotism" shall we? #Trump uses "nationalism" in a sense that is typically used as a secondary definition in most (or even all) dictionaries, as national independence and sovereignty. Its antonym is for him "globalism."
So, French President Macron thinks "patriotism" and "nationalism" are contradictory?! Hmmm. When will he announce the dissolution of the French Nation then in the name of "patriotism?" Has he consulted Le Petite Robert recently? #MAGA #tcot #nationalism #AmericaFirst #Trump2020

@iwpsfootball I meant to say try to tell them it was NOT significant to them. They would have violently disagreed. Exports of agricultural products and imports of manufactured goods were important to the Colonies,as was also the case for South at the time of the Civil War. #MAGA
@iwpsfootball The Great War intervened. Just because we improved on the mass mobilization of the Napoleonic Wars does not mean that the Napoleonic wars were any preparation ofr our Civil War. Of course their lessons were learned by military theorists. Recall the availability of rail transport.
@iwpsfootball Go back in time &amp; tell the owners of Southern plantations that! It was significant to THEM! Which is the point.
@iwpsfootball In the US Civil War, foreign powers were not terribly important, yet the difference in production and foreign trade were factors in economic differences that contributed to the conflict.
@iwpsfootball Or the foreign war is the external feature of the civil war. This is common in the West.
@iwpsfootball China is always at war with itself and only occasionally with others.
@marco_anthony24 They are all dead now. The issues that provoked this conflict have passed out of memory.
@iwpsfootball The Great War had no Chinese Theatre to my knowledge. Perhaps you have the wrong war.
@marco_anthony24 "The Great War" was what they called (without exaggeration) the First World war. Since they had not sexperienced a second "great War" it would have been anachronistic to call it WW I then.

@Johnny5024 @KarmaLanding @blackgoldtexas @magpiemediaoz @realDonaldTrump @jvplive How authentically Jewish are many American Jews? Are they not Jews because of the Promises in Exodus 19? Where is their regard for the Promised Land?
@Plantagenet00 @mike_pence Expressing our religious views when we pray is our RIGHT, a right we afford others who do not respect US! What sort of supercilious nit are you? Where is your religious affiliation or are you just another foolish atheist?
@Plantagenet00 @mike_pence NO. It was a mishap. Pence is not running the candidate's show like Trump is when he comes into town. STUNT?! STUNT?! This is not a stunt. It does not benefit the Republicans or Trump. But it does reveal anti-Christian bigotry and extreme partisanship by the rabbis in MI.
@LivingstonChamp @Matthew52338399 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS The Committee for Proper Slang Orthography will take the matter under consideration and render a judgment.
@Plantagenet00 @mike_pence Three reasons: 1. The Candidate made the arrangements. 2. The Jewish Rabbis weren't supporters. 3. If it was to pray FOR the dead, this is against Pence's religion which is the same as mine. We pray for the survivors. This lends urgency to our Evangelical efforts.
In my religion, we do not pray for the dead. Their fate is sealed. We pray for survivors. I claim the tolerance for this position that other religions claim for their faith.
This has caused great consternation because the religious leader who prayed this was a Messianic Rabbi, one who believes Jesus was the Messiah. GUESS WHAT! All Christians believe this. Can't CHRISTIANS pray about the victims and for the survivors? Are our good wishes despised?!
At a campaign event in Detroit Loren Jacobs led a prayer for the victims of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting which left 11 dead. "God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, God &amp; father of my lord &amp; savior Yeshua, Jesus the Messiah, &amp; my God &amp; father, too," Jacobs prayed. #MAGA

@manzer_will I don't take that back because you misunderstood it. I was speaking of his successes for the American People whether they support him or not such as more jobs, increased manufacturing plants &amp; jobs, a great rate of capital investment, a high growth rate, and low unemployment.
@CRKittle @realDonaldTrump TMI. If I were a baby at a Bris, I think I'd say, "Thanks for the name, but no thanks for any amateur surgery." Maybe it is antiseptic or cleansing. I think you must have some animus against Jews to speak so.
@uofktf If a tourist comes here, they still must get due process if we are to impose criminal penalties on them. THAT IS A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT THEY HAVE! I could go on, but you really need to think this out. When they have a right to be here, more Constitutional rights apply to them.
@uofktf Indeed. If they have no Visa, Green Card or US Passport &amp; do not lay claim to legal resident status, work permit or citizenship, they should have to access US courts from their own land if they have standing. You aren't saying no foreigner may own anything here, are you?
@Jeden13 @realDonaldTrump But who the most? And don't we want the last to keep our secrets? Who knows. They may even have to lie to do so.
@DawgGabriel @realDonaldTrump I think it is more serious than that. He is a hothead who believes a false doctrine whose origin is not his own imagination. The like-minded may continue to be a problem. He alleges a Jewish genocide of whites while trying to perpetrate a genocide on Jews. Who taught him this?
@dduncil President Trump is the most pro-Jewish and pro-Israel President we have ever had. It makes me angry to see him slandered. I put a Philadelphia ==&gt; Pittsburg correction in. Unfortunately, Twitter doesn't allow edits.

@gburns2580 @thedailybeast Huh?
@gburns2580 @thedailybeast have been listening with half an ear to Fox. One dolt said more guns would not help. Perhaps fewer would. Let's start with any LEO's who protect his person or property and give them FEWER or no guns.
@manzer_will I don't know why you say that. Perhaps you don't get out much. Our party leadership was unanimous in its upport of Trump. The Platform &amp; the broader Manifesto attract most new adherents.
@gburns2580 @thedailybeast Oh, I know! LOL. I was talking with someone who was accusing Trump of being insane &amp; I thought you were referring to Trump, which of course you weren't! Well, I can assume he's a hater, but I have no basis yet for saying unbalanced or not. Sayoc is weird though for sure
@manzer_will Are you in the Department of the Interior by any chance?
@manzer_will Credentials are something you have, not a statement to be disagreed with. You may disapprove of or despise credentials, but not disagree with them. Do yo propose to remove the accreditation of the University of Californa at Berkeley which gave me my degree?
@manzer_will Well we SHOULD NOT AND DO NOT HAVE A DEMOCRACY. If we did, I'd definitely like to destroy it and replace it with a CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC.
@manzer_will His objecties do no please you ==&gt; His objectives do not please you. (Maybe objecties'd be a nice addition to the language! LOL)
@manzer_will The generous DACA part of the proposal was what #Trump offered in exchange for his border &amp; immigraton reforms. Dems just not interested in a solution.
@manzer_will No, you said he was an existential (mortal) threat to our "democracy." Look up "existential threat" and get back to me.
@manzer_will Yes, yes, all policy differences. But where is the insanity, either formally or informally defined? His objecties do no please you, that is clear, but he is using effective &amp; apparently Constitutional means to achieve them. Insane? It'd be CRAZY to say so! ü§£ü§£ü§£
@manzer_will How is the DACA compromise irrational? You are very familiar with it of course.
@manzer_will Dangerous behavior &amp; rhetoric is very bad (if true), but not intrinsically insane. Points 2 &amp; 3 are not evidence of mental illness either. Psychologists BTW last time I checked have no more Constitutional standing than do Political Parties!!!
@gburns2580 @thedailybeast So you don't like the cut of his jib. but what is your evidence of insanity? And PLEASE don't cite his disagreement with your political positions!
@MattStakk @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Amen to that.
@manzer_will HOW is he a mortal threat to our REPUBLIC? The Constitution in a rare assertion of a duty assigns a guarantee of a "republican form of government" to the States by the United States. How has Trump violated the Constitution? Be specific.
@manzer_will Be specific in your critique of Trump please. We find ourselves in greater sync with him than we see the Republicans. We've been muted in our critiques of him, true, but wait until his reelection. That will be time enough for a strong expression of them. Entitlements the biggest.
@MattStakk @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Read Exodus 19 for a summary of the Covenant (Old Covenant). See Jerimiah 31 for a prophecy of the New Covenant. See Hebrews, Galations, Ephesians, Romans, 1st &amp; 2nd Peter &amp; the Gospel of John for a description of the New. See Ezekiel &amp; Psalms 2 for the restoration of Israel.
@manzer_will Although we are not racist, why should I not regard members of #TheResistance as traitors? You resist the results of a fair election. Is this not war against the United States &amp; hence fitting the Constitutional definition of treason?
@manzer_will We're not far right. Your mistake is you read Wikipedia &amp; believe it. See my profile &amp; look at my attempted edit of the Wikipedia article.

The impeachment process takes 1st a majority of the House, then 2/3rds of the Senate. The 25th Amendment takes 2/3rds of both houses of Congress to keep a President who wants to return out for longer than about a month. And even then the 25th is potentially temporary. #MAGA #tcot

@alexruthrauff No, I'd modify it to read except for involuntary servitude to accomplish restitution or punitive restitution to the victims of a crime of which the person was duly convicted.
@JoshuaCherry88 @realDonaldTrump If you shouldn't have to pay taxes, why should you obey any other law? What distinguishes that from anarchism?
@Thantilize Section 2 of the 25th Amendment gives the President the obligation to nominate a replacement for the VP when the office is vacated. If that happens &amp; Trump nominates someone, the odds are against getting someone as good as Pence #MAGA @realDonaldTrump @POTUS #tcot #ccot #teaparty

@Thantilize It does. Not section 1, 2, or 3, but section 4 if the VP &amp; a majority of the cabinet say so, but this results in the VP being ACTING President. If a miracle occurs, the President steps back in.
@Thantilize Yes, we get an acting President for the remainder of the term in such a situation. After you exercise the powers and fulfill the duties of an office, you still do not get the label unless elected by the Electoral College or by a majority of House State delegations in another case
@Thantilize Permanent involuntariy servitude is indistinguishable from slavery, so if the reference of "duly convicted of a crime" applies only to involuntary, it is still possible to be sentenced to slavery by another name.
@ElhiSaucedo Keep playing ringtoss with donuts.
@Thantilize @realDonaldTrump Nope. According to the 13thA if you are convicted of a crime, you may be sentenced to being a slave. READ IT!
Absolutely, today. Back when it was ratified, it affected only blacks, since only they were slaves. Maybe it affected indentured servants if there were any of those still around. But no it does not mention blacks, nor is anything in it limited to or exclusive of blacks. https://t.co/HKuCU3Ui95

@OCTeaPartyBlog @realDonaldTrump You can forget about a 2024 Candidacy for Cruz. He is unqualified since his mother never registered his foreign birth and is still a subject of the Queen, never having renounced that status. Also, we don't like him.
Not only that, petition's not protest. Petition is asking &amp; protesting last time I checked was demanding (usually of those without the authority to respond effectively). Also PEACEABLE assembly's not to the right to petition, which is entirely separate #MAGA #tcot #teaparty #ccot
Why is the "First Amendment" the 1st amendment? Well, it was the 1st approved, but it was the 3rd proposed. The 1st 2 dealt with representation &amp; corruption of the legislature. The anti-corruption proposal's now the 27th Amendment. The 1st was never adopted. #MAGA #tcot #teaparty
@ProLifePeace Yes, and the right to petition is not given as a reason for assemblies of whatever nature. They are separate rights. And the right is to petition (for redress of grievances) i.e. to ASK that what you think is worng be fixed by those with the power to fix it.
@gaquitaine @realDonaldTrump Because I'm interested in substance, not just insults.
@wackyterbacky5 @realDonaldTrump So the answer is NO, it's not illegal in all circumstances. It was not abolished, but severely limited and not limited enough in my opinion. I think it ought to ONLY be used if the punishment is restitution.
Richard Fowler said the "right to protest" was in the 1st Amendment because the Founders thought it was very important. Funny thing, they proposed it as the 3rd one of 12. We adopted the last 10  of the 12 immediately. The 2nd one hung fire until it became our latest amendment. https://t.co/xtTpNPAEYy
Richard, heard you on Media Buzz. You made a common mistake. You said the Founders put the right to protest in the 1st Amendment. You may think I can't read. There's that #1 on the "First Amendment," But the 1st amendment adopted was the third amendment proposed! @Richardafowler

@BanGunFreeZones @realDonaldTrump The 22nd Amendment makes clear the distinction between actually holding the office of President and merely temporarily being Acting President: in the phrase, "held the office of President or acted as President." #MAGA #tcot #teaparty #ccot #twisters #Trump2020 #Constitution #ocra
@BanGunFreeZones @realDonaldTrump A22S1 No person shall be elected to the office of the Pres. more than twice &amp; no person who has held the office of Pres. or acted as Pres. for more than 2 years of a term to which some other person was elected Pres. shall be elected to the office of the Pres. more than once.

@avoiceofliberty @realDonaldTrump Which is why I issued a revised poll, so the answer would be unambiguous.
@CodyReber1 @realDonaldTrump The 2nd Section of the 25th Amendment is the governing authority. It says the President SHALL nominate a replacement for the VP when the office is vacant. A President may not resume the Presidency if the office is held by another. THE ACTING PRESIDENT DOES NOT HOLD THE OFFICE.

The #POLL below needs adjustment. When the VP assumes the powers and duties of the office of POTUS, is the office of the VP, thereby vacated? ==&gt; When the VP assumes the powers and duties of the office of POTUS as Acting President, is the office of the VP, thereby vacated? #MAGA https://t.co/zY5TNZfYsR
@attnut @realDonaldTrump There are 4 circumstances under which the VP office is vacant: 1. Removal by Congress 2. Death 3. Resignation. The VP becoming Acting President is not one of them. 4. When the VP succeeds to the Presidency if the President is removed, dead or resigns NOT when he's merely disabled
@LanePietrylo @realDonaldTrump The VP only becomes Acting President unless the President is removed, dies or resigns. Diability MAY be temorary, so the VP becomes ACTING President TEMPORARILY until the diability is cured. If it isn't, it isn't, but the bare potential remains until the last breath of the term.
@LPetloon54 @realDonaldTrump If the office of the President is vacant (removed, died or resigned) then the VP becomes President, not just an Acting President. If the office of Vice President is vacant, the President SHALL nominate a VP for Congress to approve. HE MUST DO SO. But if BOTH are gone, what then?
@Uhadmail @realDonaldTrump @POTUS So you'll know that an impeached &amp; convicted President may be (probably will be) barred from ANY US office, much less the Presidency for life. The power to do this is granted to the Senate there. READ IT!
@CodyReber1 @realDonaldTrump No. Not in the Constitution or Statute or history.
@BanGunFreeZones @realDonaldTrump Disagree with what in particular? Reagan's secret executive order on this matter is invalid.
@Uhadmail @realDonaldTrump @POTUS See Article 1, Section 3, last clause for the Senate's power to punish the President.
@CombatVet4Life @realDonaldTrump A speaker CAN become VP, but not automatically unless Congress so provides when both the offices of VP &amp; President are simultaneously vacant. He can also become VP if nominated by the President to fill a vacant VP position and approved by Congress.
@Geek4MAGA @realDonaldTrump Correct.
@Geek4MAGA @realDonaldTrump Yes. Impeachment is for malfeasance. Sections 3 and 4 of the 25thA are for DISABILITY.
@LPetloon54 @realDonaldTrump Wrong. The succession is not musical chairs. The Speaker NEVER succeeds to the Vice Presidency. He does not replace the function of the Vice President in the Senate either. That falls to the President Pro Tempore of the Senate. #MAGA #tcot #teaparty #ccot
@Uhadmail @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Yes not in the LAW, but POSSIBLY in the ACT of the Senate in prescribing the sentence if the President is convicted after the indictment by the House (impeachment). The Senate is allowed to not only end the current President's holding of office but his future holding of it. #MAGA
@irish15202 @realDonaldTrump Not in the use of "vacated." If vacated, then vacant. If vacant, eligible to be filled. The Vice President by becoming Acting President does not vacate his office of Vice President. A refined version of the poll clarifies but does not correct this wording. See my latest poll.
@attnut @realDonaldTrump Wrong! The Vice President is Acting President, not President. When the President's disability is cured (if it is) then the President resumes the exercise of his office NEVER HAVING HAVING LOST THE OFFICE. The Acting President then is only Vice President again.
@party_eagle @realDonaldTrump See subsequent refinement of this poll question.
@LanePietrylo @realDonaldTrump Wrong! See Section 2 of the 25thA.

@Uhadmail @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Impeachment is not equivalent to removal. It is equivalent to indictment. The Senate conducts the trial &amp; only the Senate votes on removal or other allowable penalties. The Senate could choose not to remove from office or impose future disabilites.

The answer to the "#POLL When the VP assumes the office of the US President, is the office of the VP, thereby vacated?" is probably NO. If I'd said, "assume the powers and duties of the office" the answer would clearly be NO #MAGA #tcot #ccot #teaparty @realDonaldTrump #Trump2020 https://t.co/CktaPZJujO
The correct answer to the "#POLL When the provisions of Sect 3 of the 25thA are invoked, is the office of POTUS thereby vacated?" is NO. Sec 3 just lets POTUS give the reins to the VP as Acting President until he decides to take them again. #MAGA #tcot #ccot #teaparty #Trump2020 https://t.co/uBdRbZXXlR
The correct answer to the "#POLL When the provisions of Section 4 of the 25th Amendment are invoked, is the office of the US President thereby vacated?" is NO. An Acting President is TEMPORARY. An Acting POTUS is 1 reason given for a Senate President Pro Tempore #MAGA #tcot #ccot https://t.co/LJx2dVRvqe
@BanGunFreeZones @realDonaldTrump It's inconvenient, but arrangements for the nuclear football to be used by the Speaker can be made. But how do we react to a disabled President &amp; a disabled VP in that circumstance? Answer use impeachment to remove one or both.
The answer to the "#POLL When using the provisions of the 25thA the Vice President discharges the powers &amp; duties of the US President may he also act as President of the Senate?" is PROBABLY No. See Art 2 Sec 3. The VP as acting POTUS is 1 of 2 reasons for a President Pro Tempore https://t.co/kF2Xh9LcAc
The correct answer to the "#POLL Are the following all equivalent: 1. "exercise the office" 2. "assume the powers &amp; duties of the office" 3. "discharge the powers &amp; duties of the office?" is YES. #MAGA #tcot #ccot #teaparty @realDonaldTrump #Trump2020 #TrumpTrain #Trump #twisters https://t.co/0s6ENpIlDF
The correct answer to the "#POLL Are uses of Section 3 &amp; 4 of the 25th Amendment mutually exclusive?" is UNKNOWN.

The correct answer to the "#POLL Can the President of the US be removed from office by use of the provisions of the 25th Amendment?"  is NO!

@BanGunFreeZones @realDonaldTrump Nope, you only need a fully capable POTUS or Acting POTUS.
@Steven_Swenson @LeeHernly @realDonaldTrump The VP can resign, but then he would not be Acting President which requires that he be VP. If the VP is impeached, convicted &amp; removed by 2/3rd of the Senate then present (with a quorum), he also ceases to be Acting President.
@Steven_Swenson @gunny_6588 @ralph56299728 @realDonaldTrump Exactly right.
@jesseg1218 @realDonaldTrump Yep, but when the VP is Acting President, he is still VP &amp; the office is NOT VACANT. No problem. There is a President Pro Tempore of the Senate to preside in the absence of the VP. The Speaker is next in line, so we do not need an active VP which we never have anyway.
@BanGunFreeZones @realDonaldTrump You're right.
@fut1952 @realDonaldTrump You can't limit it to temporary incapacitation. Someone may be so incapacitated they cannot resign. No problem. The VP can continue as Acting President to the end of the term &amp; the VP has a President Pro Tempore to preside over the Senate. The office of the VP then is NOT vacant.
@BanGunFreeZones @realDonaldTrump The Twentyfifth Amendment DOES NOT PROVIDE A PATH TO THE REMOVAL OF THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE. IT PROVIDES FOR ONLY, ONLY, ONLY A TEMPORARY SITUATION OF THE VP ACTING AS PRESIDENT HOWEVER LONG THAT MAY PERSIST. #MAGA #tcot #teaparty #ccot
@foyjh @realDonaldTrump Of course not. The assent of the VP is required as well, assuming of course that "the Cabinet" is identical to the "principal officers" referred to in the 25thA.
@BanGunFreeZones @realDonaldTrump Section 1 applies to succession if the Office of the Presidency's ALREADY VACANT. Section 2 imposes a DUTY on the President to nominate a replacement VP WHEN THE OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT'S ALREADY VACANT. Section 3 provides a procedure for the President to make VP an AP #MAGA
@BanGunFreeZones @realDonaldTrump I disagree. Acting President is NOT equivalent to President, no matter how long the Acting Presidency persists.
@JasonCutter11 @realDonaldTrump Or send the Committee staff investigators or invite her to DC to testify or any combo of the above BUT NOT LET THE VOTE BE DELAYED TOO LONG!!!
@fut1952 @realDonaldTrump It's NOT A STATUTE. It is part of the Constitution. It is also not a treaty. What TYPE of disability is NOT specified in the 25A. But the use of section 3 or 4 is not arbitrary. Since the meaning of disability may be in dispute, Congress is allowed to act in a Sec 4 disagreement.
@BanGunFreeZones @realDonaldTrump What happens if the President voluntarily relinquishes the exercise of his office (temporarily of cours) AT THE SAME TIME AS SECTION 4 IS INVOKED? Which takes precedence? I'm not sure. #MAGA #tcot #teaparty #ccot #Trump2020
@BanGunFreeZones @realDonaldTrump Section 4 explanation continued ... then 21 days after the VP &amp; a majority of the deciding body (cabinet by default) dispute the President's reinstatement by a 2/3rd majority of both houses, to keep the President from reinstatement. About 8 days plus 21 = about 29 days. #MAGA
@BanGunFreeZones @realDonaldTrump It takes 2/3rds of both houses of Congress agreeing to keep the President from resuming his office in about a month. Temporary removal, 1 day, attempt to resume office 1 day, 4 days to reinstate temporary removal, 2 days to reconvene Congress, some indefinite time to debate, ...
I guess the answer depends on what you assume "assume an office" means. I assume it allows for the possibility of a TEMPORARY ASSUMPTION as provided for in the 25thA's provisions for the VP being a TEMPORARY Acting President #MAGA #tcot #ccot #teaparty @realDonaldTrump #Trump2020
@Ginny_zoo Getting elected to my second term as Chairman of the AIP, researching endorsements, planning my 75th birthday celebration, etc.
The REASON the Constitution provides for a President pro tempore of the Senate's so when the VP is absent or is the ACTING PRESIDENT, the Senate'll not lack a presiding officer. It makes clear an anticipation of the VP's temporary exercise of the Presidency as ACTING PRESIDENT.
The ONLY thing the 25th Amendment can do relative to the Presidency is TEMPORARILY suspend the President's exercise of the office while the VP exercises the office as ACTING PRESIDENT!!!#MAGA #tcot #ccot #teaparty @realDonaldTrump #Trump2020 #TrumpTrain #Trump #Trump2016 #ocra https://t.co/GFPKQcXmql
Unfortunately even careful reading of a complex provision like the 25th Amendment is no gurantee of understanding. In fact, understanding is unlikely. So FEW folks think precisely. #MAGA #tcot #ccot #teaparty @realDonaldTrump #Trump2020 #TrumpTrain #Trump #twisters #ocra #tgdn
@piercesk1 @realDonaldTrump In 4 days the rebellious VP &amp; Cabinet can force Congress to decide the matter, but if they are immediately arrested, they will have no opportunity to invoke the participation of Congress. The Pres gets the Pres Pro Tem &amp; Speaker together, delivers his resumption notice &amp; strikes
@piercesk1 @realDonaldTrump Yes that is likely or in chains. The way I read sections 3 &amp; 4 is that in both cases the President immediately resumes his office when he says so to the President pro tempore &amp; the Speaker.
@BanGunFreeZones @realDonaldTrump But what about SECTION THREE?! If a President will be recovering for a while, he may use this provision and IMMEDIATELY RESUME HIS OFFICE WHENEVER HE PLEASES!
@BanGunFreeZones @realDonaldTrump No it doesn't. The President Pro tempore of the Senate means we can do without the VP for the duration.
@BanGunFreeZones @realDonaldTrump As long as the potential restoration remains, he is NOT REMOVED &amp; the VP position is NOT VACANT. A plague on your "effectively!" What if the "head wound" is miraculously cured?
@pottsdc @realDonaldTrump True. Death, resignation &amp; removal by the Senate after an impeachment by the House cause the succession of the VP to the Presidency, but neither sections 3 nor 4 of the 25th Amendment can cause such a succession. #MAGA #tcot #ccot #teaparty @realDonaldTrump #Trump2020 #TrumpTrain

@gunny_6588 @ralph56299728 @realDonaldTrump Assuming an office is not the same as taking, having, being in or holding an office. The VP under Sections 3 or 4 can TEMPORARILY ASSUME THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT &amp; ITS POWERS &amp; DUTIES AS ACTING PRESIDENT.
@livinbythelake Not just Liberals.
@AbeCheyanne Yes BUT ONLY WHEN THE VP OFFICE IS VACANT! "Assuming" an office doesn't mean holding, having or being in the ofice. The 25th A DOESN'T ALLOW REMOVAL OF THE PRESIDENT! It just provides for the temporary (hopefully) assumption of his duties &amp; powers by the VP as ACTING President,
@jimcromeans Whenever the VP's office is vacant, the President "shall nominate a Vice-President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress" according to Section 2 of the 25th Amendment.
@jimcromeans Assuming, exercising or discharging an office or its powers and duties is NOT the same as holding or having or being in the office. All of the first list are true of an Acting President, but none of the second list are true of the Acting President's relation to the office.

@MHZgraphics @realDonaldTrump The one who can sue is the President, as President, not as a private person, for interfering with one of his Constitutional duties.
@Greyling_PJ @realDonaldTrump The character of #SCOTUS nominees is very important. The Senate Judiciary Committee employs professional investigators because they deal with important nominations and other matters that come up in the course of oversight.
@Greyling_PJ @realDonaldTrump No one else then. Not a Federal crime. The State crime (alleged) is beyond the statute of limitations. So the investigation will not be a criminal one. Although there is an allegation of a crime, it the allegation is mischaracterized as rape.

I think the answer's 2. I dropped several hundred followers all of a sudden. Could it be because many Trump supporters can't bear any adverse info about Trump? That'd be ill-advised. We need to know the facts in order to face the opposition to Trump. I hope you agree. #MAGA #tcot
#POLL results. 2/3rds of respondents don't think anything like that happened. I was trying to show it's rare since I was already aware of 1  instance.

@stardustshamroc @Suluclac @realDonaldTrump I never even MENTIONED QAnon. The question's does the #Resistance believe in itself? Is the Alt-Shadow Government going to begin to assert itself? Will it do what the Anonymous NYT op-ed CLAIMS it's doing or will it engage in more assassinations &amp; attempted ones like in CA today?
@JosephParkerNOW @realDonaldTrump Do you mean there are three instances? So far I'v only seen the black guy and the cowboy punching an anti-Trump protester.
@JosephParkerNOW @realDonaldTrump Is that ALL we agree on? Surely not. See https://t.co/x4FI5iXKS8

@smothertucker4 @realDonaldTrump How can the 2/3rds who don't know any instances be bragging about it? The 78-year-old who sucker-punched the young black protester was brought up on charges, apologized &amp; made up &amp; I believe got off with a warning.
@Suluclac @realDonaldTrump Have you been watching #FoxNews? Doesn't opposition always bring up violence against Trump protesters by Trump supporters, with, as far as I know, only one example? If BTW you are so smart, what is stupid about asking this question?

@LibertyIsALady The Anthem &amp; Flag are the quintessential symbols of national unity. To disrespect either is to show disrespect to the nation no matter what the claimed intent is. The bulk of those whom the protestors would persuade agree with me, so the form of protest is STUPID! #maga #ccot

@Drathzaar I see that you need more than a cigar. A clue would help. There's two ways to look at this, ordinary speech &amp; legally. You're wrong on both counts. Citizenship is a legal construct. It implies rights and obligations under the law. Jarrett, however disloyal was born an American.
Fanatical Islamists compare Jews to Apes &amp; Pigs. Should we conclude then when a comparison to an ape is made, that the ape is to represent a Black? Why not a Jew or just anyone who has some characteristic of an ape which we don't like? Like thin upper lips like whites have? #MAGA

Also, I find that my Following exceeds 110% of my Followers, presumably impossible! Is something squirrely with Twitter or do they just hate folks like me?
@MarkMaitag I served in Korea in 1967. I was also an Air Force brat who spend almost 2 years in the Philippines. For entertainment, I read the Special Weapons Effects manual when 9 years old. It was only classified Confidential &amp; my father who let me read it is dead now.
After several hours of inactivity, I see a message that my account is locked. I go thru the unlock procedure in about 5 minutes. THEN, I find my account peppered with unfollows. Leave me alone you little #TWITTER left-wing weasels or I'll start a political campaign against you!
The right answer to this #POLL question about how the US Constitution was ratified is SPECIAL STATE CONVENTIONS! That's how it is ratified, not proposed. Your response was pitiful &amp; reveals the depth of your ignorance. READ THE CONSTITUTION--ALL THE WAY THRU TO HOW RATIFIED #maga https://t.co/dxooOey1ds
@MarkMaitag Understood. Currently, neither of us is subject to the limitations incumbent upon active duty personnel or currently employed government employees. FYI, I was on active duty as an ROTC Army Field Artillery officer for two years with three years reserve obligation.
@MarkMaitag My #POLL respondenta are select and moreover self-selected set. 84% favor a default to losing all clearances when leaving the government service which occasioned it. If you feel strongly about it, I encourage you to keep trying to persuade me that that is not a good idea.
@MarkMaitag Yes, the scope of secret material that those with the authority to grant access is precisely the risk exposure to which I refer. But why we should give a 2nd thought to stripping security clearances from the disloyal or criminal, I don't have a clue.
@MarkMaitag If you are obliquely referring to "TEMPEST" as an electronic security standard for SCIF's, it is in the public domain as such. I know how to keep a true secret. The crash of a plane on Travis with a nuke aboard for instance in 1949 or 1950. That's now public "knowldege."
@MarkMaitag Actually, I wasn't, but there is a distinction between Top Secret and Top Secret Compartmentalized. I had a Top Secret Crypto in 1967 that enabled me to perform an extra duty I had. How long have they been using "Compartmentalized" as a qualifier? My active duty is far behind me.
@MarkMaitag The very most secret classified material has higher standards for its viewing &amp; processing than the merely top secret. Temporary special purpose SCIF's can though be set up upon occasion if certain standards ar met, the most important of which I suppose now-a-days are in TEMPEST.
@MarkMaitag Who has the authority to grant access? Surely that's a much broader class of persons than the 20 who can classify material. There's your potential trouble.
@wordsofthislife Agreed.
@JimEstep777 @molonelabe AND just incase I shold ever be tempted to list you in any way, I put you on my private list of secret Trump supporters who don't want to be listed. (And your support for Trump is really really SECRET isn't it?! LOL)
@JimEstep777 @molonelabe Well, that's the method I use often immediately followed by an unblock and a follow. I've permanently blocked @molonelabe FYI.
@MarkMaitag Are you a current or former member of the "Intelligence Community" yourself?
@MarkMaitag Then add in the expanded opportunities that legitimate access provides for illegitimate actions such as leaking. Capiche?
@MarkMaitag A SCIF is not the only means of access. Receipt of classified info which can be appropriately secured is another way. Multiply all legitimate modes of access by the number of remaining partisans at intelligence agencies and you can see the exposure.
@kevin_musgrove3 The Continental Congress was the Articles of Confederation Congress and existed prior to the Articles being proposed, used and ratified.
@MarkMaitag Not entirely the case. It opens the door for information to be shared without committing a crime.

@alexruthrauff But you missed the point. Thery are NOT are requirement for being a roman font, but they ARE a requirement for being a Roman font.
@alexruthrauff "Popular roman typefaces include Bembo, Baskerville, Caslon, Jenson, Times New Roman and Garamond." https://t.co/6G1U2GJl9T The difference is whether you capitalize Roman/roman or not. What I say is true of Roman type. #MAGA #tcot
@alexruthrauff " Robert Estienne in France codified the modern characteristics of Roman type, for instance an 'h' with a nearly straight right leg, serifs on the outside of the capital 'M' and 'N', and 'e' with level cross stroke, by the 1530s.[8][9]" https://t.co/6G1U2GJl9T #MAGA #tcot #ccot

@BigBobDC68 @mrgnklly But the folks who RATIFIED the  Constitution were not those folks.

@ShoottoKill7 @MackinMelanie @CyberRabid That expreses my understanding of the matter. The opinion of the framer is very useful, but not determinative, since the intentions of the framer do not trump the plain language of the text as understood by educated ratifiers.
@MackinMelanie You were a potential or actual citizen at birth enjoying dual citizenship, but in order to actualize your US citizenship, you had to have it claimed for you when returning to US territory at a tender age, but otherwise by a certain age when you were capable of making that choice.
@CyberRabid It would behoove naturalization statutes to take account of the distinction between single citizenship and dual citizenship of parents, temporary visitor, permanent resident, married or unmarried, and the legal status of their presence in the US. #MAGA #tcot #teaparty #ccot #ocra
@FelixNunez249 My goal is contained in the Lord's Prayer, namely "Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven." In other words, I want positive law (human law) to be made in accord with divine law.  Of course, that's the law of Christ, not of Moses.
@Mannix1925 Yes, and you were only able to do that because of a naturalization statute.
@CyberRabid If they are illegal immigrants, they do not have dual citizenship, nor does the act of tourism create such. I agree in principle, but some dual citizenships US-Swiss or US-Israeli never or seldom give us problems.
@inkjetblue constitution = the act of forming something. We ordained (decreed) and by sufficient specificity established a form of government. Framework connotes a necessity of finishing work. Indeed we needed to enact statutes in accord with it. Especially laws to make powers effective.

The Latin phrases for the 2 principles are 1. jus sanguinis (right of blood) 2. jus soli (right of soil). The 14th Amendment is neither "jus sanguinis" nor "jus soli" since it requires both criteria which are usually considered mutually exclusive. Evidently they are not so! #MAGA
Automatic US citizenship at birth in the 14th Amendment is not just due to place of birth or the status of the parents, but BOTH! IF the parents are "subject to the jurisdiction thereof [of the United States]," THEN their child is as well. #MAGA #tcot #ccot #teaparty
There are two ways to automatically become an American citizen: 1. The provisions in Section 1 of the 14th Amendment. 2. A naturalization statute making some persons automatically US citizens. Only the 1st category are natural born citizens of the US. #MAGA #tcot #ccot #teaparty

@allen_aptos Don't be a jackass Brad! Folks immgrating illegally are not automatically guilty of killing people and destroying property (the business of ACTUAL armis BTW). The enemies in "providing aid and comfort" in the Constitution are organized groups such as nations.

@JamesSphillips @realDonaldTrump @POTUS That's very confused. I suggest use of periods to separate sentences. The intentions of framers of laws do NOT govern the effect..

@JeffreyLWright1 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS This is controversial and unadjudicated. Don't trust anything Lyin' Ted has to say about it.
@IClaudius3 @vetnav6 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS My "natural rights" are "divine rights." Take the right to life for instance. The duty of all men not to take my life unjustly found in the Decalogue implies my right not to have any take it unjustly. So the Declaration right to life is founded in Scripture &amp; Deontic Logic.
@IClaudius3 @vetnav6 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Not all natural law philosophy is Rousseauian. Se Hobbes' "De Cive" for an excellent example. Please ignore his Leviathan. Also, Vattel &amp; Bastiat are not followers of Rousseau.
@WaWaWartortle The unborn person is very limited in what it can do other than kick its mother. So the application of laws to acts of persons to the unborn person is very small. However, as inactive as an unborn person is it STILL HAS A LIFE which can be taken unjustly &amp; violate homicide laws.
The #RussianFederation conceives of the US as their enemy &amp; they ours. The Russian Parliament (Duma) &amp; Public APPROVE of the Russina agression in the anexation of The Crimea. We should none-the-less exact a VERY great price for this, i.e. loss of their Syrian ally &amp; bases. #MAGA
@supersilo012 No it's a standard for holding office.

@000reginapeyto1 Moreover, we must also insist on due process &amp; equal protection for unborn persons, resident aliens, foreign visitors &amp; even the illegally immigrated. Quick deportation without judicial process of those without documentation IS due process! #MAGA #tcot #ccot #teaparty
@supersilo012 I don't know the truth of that matter, but Trump's past sexual behavior has certainly not been moral. I will be content if he behaves himself in office. "We flatter ourselves that we have left our vices, when in fact they have left us." Vauvenargues #MAGA #tcot #ccot #teaparty
We should be very protective of special rights of citizens, which're primarily rights of participation in the political process &amp; also welfare "rights" which citizens shouldn't have either. Public education should definitely NOT be a right of any but citizens &amp; Green Card holders
@WaWaWartortle Yes, but "persons" have rights too. Not voting rights of course or office holding privileges. But unborn persons, foreign visitors, Green Card holders &amp; even illegally immigrated persons, get due process &amp; equal protection but the illegally immigrated enjoy those only temporarily
It's easy to tell the difference between Democrats &amp; Republicans--Democrats bemoan children temporarily ripped from the arms of illegally immigrated mothers &amp; Republicans mourn the many more unborn children ripped from their mother's wombs. #MAGA #tcot @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
@SovietRefugee Your utopia requires a tyranny even beyond the tyranny it is of itself.

I'm for non-partisan judicial nominations and confirmations if both parties are devoted to the Constitution, not just one sometimes. Unfortunately, the Democrats have adopted a philosophy opposed to the rule of law and in particular of the Constitution.
@girlweena @IClaudius3 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Non-natural-born certainly. Maybe not even a citizen. His mother registered to vote in Canada. If she did, then she automatically lost her citizenship and was not one at the birth of Ted Cruz. Since the father was not American, that is his only shot at citizenship.
@vetnav6 @IClaudius3 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Vattel's an excellent source for natural law philosophy as well as international relations. Of course without a governing authority there is no "law." Even our treaties are acts of will not subject to any remedy short of war if we violate them. So "international law" is a fiction

@rowdyrr9 BTW your misunderstanding of the word "interpretation" is commonplace and ignorant. See the defintion https://t.co/YGx3UmWWch In the context of judicial interpretation, "interpretation" is simply a determination of meaning (necessary to EVERYONE in everyday life).

@USMC_Proud The 14th Amendment is the ONLY source of automatic citizenship in the Constitution and one requirement of that automatic status is BIRTH IN THE US. Being a citizen at birth according to a naturalization statute is not CONSTITUTIONAL automatic citizenship, but rather STATUTORY.
@USMC_Proud Morelover if you were right, all those naturalizaiton statutes which say they are US citizens under such and so circumstance would be unnecessary.
@USMC_Proud Only the US-born MAY be automatically US citizens IF they are subject to US jurisdiction. The citizenship or legal residence or the marital state of the parents may figure into whether the born person is subject to.  US jurisdiction.
@politico @DonKeko1971 The US should tank the Chinese economy if it gets a sufficient pretext in order to thwart their plans for world dominance. If #DPRK negotiations break down, sanctioning major Chinese banks doing business with them should crash their markets &amp; burst their real estate bubble.
@DonKeko1971 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS "on the Russian payroll?!" Total BS which ironically has restrained Trump from confronting the Russian Federation until now.
@USMC_Proud Which is wrong, since foreign parents not holding Green Cards are NOT subject to US jurisdiction. In other words, the anchor baby/birthright citizenship doctrine is wrong.
@IClaudius3 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Natural law rights are dicey. Such concepts got us homosexual marriage, an unnatural right if you please. The 9th amendment is DANGEROUS if not narrowly interpreted as merely a limit on a certain form of legal argumentation.
@USMC_Proud Isn't it pitiful how many people are ignorant and inclined to form their opinions on results they wish and not law or principles? In fact, law supports what most of them want anyway, but showing them that is VERY difficult.
@USMC_Proud ABSOLUTELY! But we still have to fight it out on social media, since it is the rare twit or tweety that will read the material you just gave the link to.
@n0jaa Yes, but what if the foreign parents have Green Cards? Like Kamella Harris and Bobby Jindal? Are Green Card Holders subject to US jurisdiction, but tourists and illegal immigrants are not?
@inkjetblue Only natural. I am a mathematician.
@IClaudius3 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Yes, &amp; the conclusion was that it was birthplace &amp; not blood that bestowed citizenship according to the 14th Amendment, but #SCOTUS got the "subject to the jurisdiction of" part wrong and granted citizenship to someone not under that jurisdiction. WITHIN it but not subject to it.
@RickSmol So some anchor babies are not anchor babies if another country says so? Other countries may not care to protect their citizens abroad indeed. However, their right to do so is unimpaired. And those born to foreign citizens are NOT subject to the jurisdiction of the US in any event

@inkjetblue I think that most other NATO countries should spend more on defense to deter a revival of a more expansive "Russian Empire." But the discussion is polluted with so many misleading statements, I HAD TO comment.
If those born abroad to US citizens are subject to the jurisdiction of the US, then babies born to foreign parents in the US are subject, not to the US, but to the country of their parents.
@inkjetblue @realDonaldTrump Naturalization's making a non-citizen into a citizen. Anyone who's a citizen automatically according to the Constitution does not need naturalization &amp; is also a natural born citizen. Almost every US Citizen is a NATURAL BORN CITIZEN except it seems those who want to be President
If you are born abroad, you are NOT US born. If you are born in the US (US born), you are NOT born abroad.

@rowdyrr9 You're right that the 14A does not explicitly say the unborn are persons, yet its language hints that they are, probably unintentionally when it speaks of PERSONS being born. What is ADDED when born is possiby citizenship.
@rowdyrr9 No of course not. That helps determine its CITIZENSHIP, NOT PERSONHOOD. I deliberately did not specify place of birth, because, although citizens, the unborn person is NOT a citizen until birth with the 2 condiditions set in the 14A.
@inkjetblue @realDonaldTrump @RealCandaceO @DonaldJTrumpJr @mitchellvii What do you think I'm trying?!! There is no "birthright citizenship" based solely on WHERE one is born.

Also, my English teachers taught me that you modify a noun with an adjective. "Democrat" is a noun, not an adjective. The Democratic Party chose to adhere to normal grammar in the construction of their name, with a putative adjective, "Democratic" before a putative noun, "Party."
If all the "members" or registrants with the Democratic Party're democrats, then it is a democratic party, whatever its name is! I don't think that's true, so I won't call the Democratic Party the Democrat Party lest anyone think they are all democrats. Most are STATISTS. #MAGA

@cburns926 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS "Any Born Human" means, of course, all human beings drawing breath on Earth. That is the intelligent Pro-Choice answer. "Any Human, Born or Unborn" means that being persons, the unborn have a right to life equal to the born. This is the Personhood Pro-Life choice. #MAGA
@PowerPolitics @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Wad ==&gt; Wade.
@PowerPolitics @realDonaldTrump @POTUS The question is whether an unborn human person is a Constitutional person in the context of the 14th Amendment. I say yes. Roe vs Wad says that IF the unborn are such persons, they get equal protection, but asserts that they are NOT Constitutional person in the 14th Amendment.
@PowerPolitics @realDonaldTrump @POTUS ONLY the 1st section of the 14th Amendment entitles unborn persons to equal protection of the laws and hence homicide laws AT THE STATE LEVEL. This ultimately IS NOT JUST A STATE ISSUE because Section 5 of the 14thA allows Congress to FORCE equal protection on the States. #MAGA
@xentrc526 That's what I was afraid of.
@Abouthataction @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I'm testing &amp; informing folks. They FAILED this test. So I'm trying the question in different forms in case it was just badly designed.
ignrant ==&gt; ignorant. Is it ignorant to make a typographical error?
@PowerPolitics @realDonaldTrump @POTUS "in the United States" are US &amp; State Citizens. Yep. And the unborn person (not citizen) is entitled to equal protection of the laws, including the homicide laws.
@Slynderellas @Plantagenet00 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS A person before they are naturalized is not yet a US citizen. A person not born is not yet a US citizen even if they fit the description otherwise. Not all persons are citizens, but all citizens are persons. Grok that?

So far over 70% of you are stupid or ignrant. Person includes citizen, because all citizens are persons (so far). The only EFFECTIVE, CONSISTENT Pro-life position holds that the unborn are Constitutional Persons, not citizens in fact which they can't be until born.. Think! #MAGA

If the US shouldered the burden of vetting it delegates to other countries, that would be very expensive &amp; slow. Very well, let those who want to come here pay for the investigation. Initially, we should admit all business &amp; tourist travelers who've been admitted in the past.
Although the US must take responsibility for the vetting of those it admits to the US, sometimes the only or only practical content on that vetting is that which the country of origin provides, I would be quite comfortable with only admitting those vetted by the US directly.

Those entering the US irregularly should not be presumed to be citizens. The burden of proof by appropriate documents should be on the irregular entrant.
The question is whether such a deportation which anticipates a court hearing denies due process in regard to a liberty. I say not, since free movement in the US is a right of citizens. You can't be deprived of a liberty you don't have.

@Rubyxx Better than lying, corrupt Clinton supporters certainly!
it lon ==&gt; its long.
The recent executive order by Trump trying to reunite families is only a VERY short-term fix since there is COURT ORDER nprevening it lon continuance. Depending on how it was written it MIGHT be a Constituional overreach.
There are two good reasons for separation of minors in illegal immigrant detention facilities from the parents: there're no facilities for children where their parents're confined pending trial AND the COURT ORDER preventing minors being held for prolonged periods in such places.
Objectively, the condition of many minors in illegal immigrant detention center is MUCH better than conditions in the places they came from. Also, unaccompanied" minors now HAVE ADULT SUPERVISION &amp; CARE! That is also a great improvement. Why should AN IMPROVEMENT be distressing?
@TittyBlister I doubt that most of the minors are criminals. Their parents should be held legally accountable (if possible). I have no doubt that some of the minors have committed criminal acts.
@1kecko This is as disgusting an example of guilt by association as it gets. It's essentially criminalizing contact with Russia or Russians.
@1kecko BTW would you really like to pursue the "corporations are not persons" theme? If they are NOT in legal terms, they can't be held responsible for violating contracts or laws. ONLY moral persons should be held to those standards, and ONLY legal persons CAN be!
@1kecko The evidence so far is that tempting info about Hillary was dangled in front of several Trump campaign members, but none bit. What we know looks more like an exoneration, than a basis for even beginning a counter-intelligence investigation.
@TittyBlister What's a kid? Would you call an MS-13 tattoo covered 15-year-old a kid? I'm guessing that fit teenagers are the majority of those fully unaccompanied "kids."

When 80% plus of detained minors in illegal immigration cases're described as "unaccompanied," what does that really mean? Were they perhaps accompanied by a coyote, drug cartel member, fellow gang member, or a sex trafficker? Perhaps it means "unaccompanied by a verified parent"

is the question ==&gt; are the questions.
This novel theory is motivated by recent advances in gene editing techniques. It postulates an ability to self-modify in adaptive ways. The trigger for this and the mechanism guiding the adaptations made in a beneficial direction is the question posed by this hypothesis.
What has been lacking in all Evolutionary Theories (actually Hypotheses) is a MECHANISM for significant changes of a beneficial variety. Essentially the problem is similar to trying to take small steps over a large chasm. #MAGA #tcot #ccot #teaparty #Trump2020
The mechanisms of extinction are fairly well-understood. Not so the mechanism of speciation. Before that, of course, is a greater mystery, the origin of information machines made of DNA. The picture of gradual speciation is refuted by the geologic record which supports saltation.
Here's an interesting article on Evolution that combines (Punctuated Equilibrium, i.e. Saltationism) with a novel doctrine of adaptive DNA editing mechanisms driving genetic changes.  https://t.co/TIbErGm6BJ ‚Ä¶ #MAGA #tcot #ccot #teaparty #Trump2020 #twisters #TrumpTrain #ocra

@Supernaut718 @realDonaldTrump It's reflex. Someone attacks, a defense is mounted. When such contacts are seen as a political disadvantage, the reflex is denial, which may look like guilt to the eyes of opponents. Flynn is a prime example. He made a political denial to the FBI for an innocent conversation.

I prefer "Unitary Primary" since all the formerly seperate partisan primaries are combined into one single call it UNITARY Primary with all the candidates and all the voters irrespective of voter's or candidate's party or lack thereof. LA's Unitary Primary'd be a different flavor
"Top 2 Primary" is unambiguous. Sometimes the LA Primary is called a Unitary Primary which is very descriptive. LA's Primary differs from CA's since a majority in the CA primary does not end the selection process but just secures a place in the General. In LA that'd be a win.
Blanket Primary/Open Primary is wrong. Check it's definition.
Jungle Primary is non-descriptive and slanderous.. I am offended by it.

@piercesk1 @kilroyreport @realDonaldTrump Good distinction! We need much more of this sort of precision.
@piercesk1 @kilroyreport @realDonaldTrump The use of an animal slur such a "bitch" for an adult human female does not mean that all females are slurred thereby. So such a form of insult is not evidence of sexism, which is a negative view of most or all such females.
@piercesk1 @kilroyreport @realDonaldTrump In comon parlance all African-Americans have some black blood. It is NOT skin color alone which makes sub-Saharan African ancestry of the negroid sort, otherwise many of those you cite might be mistakenly categorized as negroid.
@piercesk1 @kilroyreport @realDonaldTrump Racism is an opinion about a CLASS, not an individual. Individual slurs MAY be motivated by racism, but need not be. When describing the appearance of a criminal, it is not racist to say that they are white, brown, yellow, pink, tan or black.

@creativeian @realDonaldTrump Let's be even-handed. All the members of the many ape species on the Planet of the Apes ought to be outraged at being associated with Valerie Jarrett, one of the worst human beings on the planet.
@BillB92467732 @realDonaldTrump Was Roseanne's tweet an insult to every species on the Planet of the Apes then? And to Muslims for good measure?
@SongBird4Trump @therealroseanne That statement (if it's real) makes it sound like she's of Iranian blood, but she's not. At least her parentage and place of birth are established facts. The rest, her religion is obscure. If you have something better on this, I'd be interested in learning it.
@Eddrick1 I acknowledge the existence of racists (individuals who embrace racism),  but contend the term's ill-defined, abused, misunderstood and all to frequently applied inappropriately and unjustly. I'll also not follow your rabbit-trails-thank you very much! #MAGA #tcot #ccot #teaparty

@Plantagenet00 No, actually he was puzzled by me. I explained my views on some matters and he burst out &amp; said how is that different from the Catholic position?! He wondered openly what sort of Christian I was. He read some of my wirtings aloud to my friend, his adult conversion specialist.

@Skippeachicky @truckrogers1 @wordsofthislife @realDonaldTrump Defending her was not my primary aim. Pointing out hypocrisy &amp; trying to get people to reserve racist as a term with more meaning than "I don't like you or what you say" was what I was trying to achieve.
@PCGalloway @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Any ideology that deals with Creation, with morals, with the ultimate end of things deserves to be called a religion. They claim to have the truth about GOD for goodness sakes! Your assertion is asinine &amp; silly.
@Trumps_ur_Pres @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I didn't see it. I'll take your word for it.
@ohwhatever76 @realDonaldTrump The reason give for Bill Maher's tweet not being racist was that it was an individual attack. True it was. However so was the attack on Valerie Jarrett. So who is stupid now?
@AitSeth @themanm1445 There can't be more than one. Say there are two. The stronger one is GOD &amp; the weaker a god.
@Rubyxx You fail I choose not to.
@truckrogers1 @wordsofthislife @realDonaldTrump I agree. Loyalty to Christ is higher than to any political creed or party. However, political activity in a Republic is not only a right of citizens, but a moral duty as one is called to that activity. And I did NOT defend her statements. It was a COMPARISON.
@Rubyxx McCarthur's motto was "Never again a land war in Asia with one hand tied behind our back." War with China conducted in Asia would probably fail. We would be forced to use nukes unless we wanted to surrender or fail.
@Skippeachicky @truckrogers1 @wordsofthislife @realDonaldTrump We call those with sufficient black blood, black. Perhaps this is itself racist. It's what I call the Black taint theory. I resent it. Why aren't those with a trace of white blood white?! Isn't my blood strong enough to taint someone?!
@BarrSharp She isn't Iranian. She was born of 2 Aftrican-American parents in Iran where she stayed until she was 5 years old. She speaks Farsi (the language of Iran) and French. She is an American national.
@BarrSharp Definitely, it's racist when it is asserted of all members of a race. When an adverse animal analogy is used of a member of a race (Trump, orangutan) it is unkind to assume a general aspersion. Why isn't it unkind to Roseanne?
Both Bill Maher &amp; Roseanne Barr allege simian ancestry of someone they dislike. Neither is a racial generalization. Whether they were made BECAUSE of an invidious opinion of a whole racial group is unknown to me &amp; in all probability to you too. #MAGA #tcot #ccot #teaparty https://t.co/9JHBWZ5wmJ
In the tweet below which has already received over 120,000 views, I do NOT address Roseanne Barr's notorious tweet but rather highlight hypocrisy. So for the record, it was a vile personal attack but lacked the form or motive for a racist comment being an individual attack. #MAGA https://t.co/9JHBWZ5wmJ

@wordsofthislife @realDonaldTrump I did NOT explicitly defend #RB's statement, but pointed out unequal treatment of similar aspersions of simian ancestry. A statement may be vile &amp; indefensible without qualifying as racist. You must not be a very good expositor if you cannot read more carefully than that! #MAGA
@bwmitchell @wordsofthislife Thank you for the defense. My critic evidently can't read very well. An attack on one person's ancestry is considered just a joke, but is racism when a Trump supporting comic makes it. #RB tried to make a joke. It wasn't funny indeed. It was a lame personal attack. #MAGA
@wordsofthislife Oh yes, it is, but it's exercised against hypocrisy in this instance. A racist assertion that #Trump's part orangutan is not considered racist, but #RB's is though neither's a racial generalization. How do you feel about Muslims saying Jews are descended from apes? THAT's racist!
@wordsofthislife @realDonaldTrump #RB may be racist or not, but her statement is clearly not. Racism is inveterate prejudice against a racial group. A racist statement must apply to a racial group, not an individual. To make an aspersion against an individual a racist statement, it must be BECAUSE of their race.
Being a White Male is bad enough from the Progressive perspective, but being a BLOND White Male is insupportable! They are bound to be evil. That attitude is RACIST! 99% of accusations of racism are illegitimate, not least because the accusers are racist themselves. #MAGA #tcot

Well she speaks Farsi &amp; was born in Iran, but has no Iranian blood. She sympathizes with Islam &amp; Iran clearly. The Iran Deal was no accident with her around.

Fellow Evangelicals, I ran across an advocate of political passivity as well as a Trump critic who wrote an article entitled "Jeremiah, the Kingdom of God, and Alternative Facts - The Danger of Trumpism for Christians" https://t.co/NQp16f8hi8 I analyzed his arguments. See below: https://t.co/Y6FRErWqV2
@wordsofthislife Should we consider promises or performance of good things as negatives then? We don't reject light just because Lucifer appears as an "Angel of Light" do we? Well, perhaps YOU do.
@JustinPetersMin @wordsofthislife Well, then I must reconsider the reliability of the Apostle Paul himself then who healed many but was refused healing for his own condition despite repeated requests. I too am skeptical of "faith healers," but our judgments should be evidence-based.
Below find my exchanges with a judgmental "preacher of God's Word" who thinks my failure to judge Roseanne a racist means I shouldn't dishonor the name of Christ by identifying myself as a Christian. I hope you find my response enlightening. #MAGA #tcot #ccot #teaparty https://t.co/EsD0446V6E
@wordsofthislife @realDonaldTrump Typically one votes for those who make false promises. Particularly delightful is that our vote for Trump has seen a remarkable fulfillment of promises. If you agreed with or admired Mr. Trump, you'd be finding excuses no doubt for expressing that support! #MAGA #ccot #tcot
@wordsofthislife @realDonaldTrump You say "When politicians lie, demonstrably lie, and as Christians we give them support, we are in collusion with that lie‚Äîwe are tainted by it." I find that a dubious assertion. Support comes in all flavors, from a vote, an agreement on any matter, a donation, a public statement
@BriskBrown @realDonaldTrump Orangutan is a race of simians.
@wordsofthislife @realDonaldTrump I'll continue reading your screed to see if you flesh out the role of "Ambassador" (literally "interpreter" in the original Greek BTW) or add any more permissible political acts for Christians. #MAGA #tcot #ccot #teaparty
@wordsofthislife @realDonaldTrump But I perceive a contradiction already in your screed, viz. that you think that beyond praying, we ought to be critics &amp; "speak truth to power!" Pray &amp; obey, PERIOD! Remember?! OK, let's expand that to Pray, Prate, &amp; Obey. As Ambassadors how are we to act? #MAGA #tcot #ccot
@wordsofthislife @realDonaldTrump However, if there ever were an instance of "You're so heavenly minded, you're of no earthly use" it's you with your advocacy of entire passivity in political matters. What struggles you must have with your conscience about whether to even lower yourself to even VOTE. #MAGA #ccot
@wordsofthislife @realDonaldTrump I won't debate her statements. I can't know all of them. However, our country is rife with false accusers &amp; those purporting to know others' hearts. You seem to have forgotten, according to your insight, I shouldn't call myself a Christian, at least in public. #MAGA #tcot #ccot
@wordsofthislife @realDonaldTrump So what was the point of all that? I believe AIPCA &amp; AIPOTUS's principles expressed in the aforesaid documents represent a coherent Christian Political Philosophy for a Constitutional Republic implementing the limited government outlined in Romans13:1-7 &amp; in the US Constitution.
@wordsofthislife @realDonaldTrump One more document. IGNORE the lies &amp; errors of the Wikipedia article on the American Independent Party. Instead, consult the correction of that ridiculous misrepresentation of our current state AND of our latter history. https://t.co/Dc4NvroI8g #MAGA #tcot #ccot #teaparty
@wordsofthislife @realDonaldTrump You say "How can we speak truth to power if we are totally in the tank for that power?" A VERY good question. &amp; 1 which I'll address at length. &amp; in this, I don't officiously assume a role not mine. See https://t.co/BFJN5QcZnq https://t.co/lCsOtJYcpr  https://t.co/x4FI5iXKS8
@wordsofthislife @realDonaldTrump You say "Christians should not be involved in the political process in the first place." (Other than Pray &amp; Obey, for there's no other way. Hmmm. Could be set to music.) So "Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven" is a prayer in which we can have no part EVEN IN A REPUBLIC?
@wordsofthislife @realDonaldTrump In a Republic, not a MONARCHY, the citizen enjoys part of the rights &amp; responsibilities of the sovereign. One example. I have a RIGHT to expect that public SERVANTS fulfill their oath to the Constitution, a Contract I have with all other Americans. #MAGA #tcot #ccot #teaparty
@wordsofthislife @realDonaldTrump You say "We respect the authority vested in government because it is ordained by God. Our role is to pray for them (1 Timothy 2:1-2) and obey the laws of the land (Romans 13:1-7). Period." This is SO wrong. I think you misunderstand Rom 13:1-7 because you are a Canadian. #MAGA
@wordsofthislife @realDonaldTrump You say "Ambassadors are representatives of another country." True dat, but I am bound by Romans 13:1-7. The application of that passage to citizens of a Republic is DUAL, as to BOTH rulers &amp; ruled. I am a heavenly citizen who's am Ambassador too. 4 ROLES! #MAGA #tcot #ccot
@wordsofthislife @realDonaldTrump You say "Once you collude with the political power you lose the prophetic voice to speak to it. You just become another political interest group fighting for your space in the public square" This's "begging the question" in debate. In short if we support Trump, we're wrong! #MAGA
@wordsofthislife @realDonaldTrump You say "the American evangelical Church has lost its way." That is a serious charge &amp; I will consider it carefully as I read your screed (rhymes). You also complain that no one will listen. I'm going to, but I'm eating dinner 1st.

@GrimmaceMain Maybe, if I have the right in that context. A freedom is not a right automatically. But right is a broader concept than Constitutional right which was what I was asking if I could violate. 1A rights are rights AGAINST CERTAIN SORTS OF FEDERAL LEGISLATION.

@sl2111 I was shown a photo of a Native American looking female ancestor. My mother finally admitted to being 1/8th Native American. My father by contrast was proud of his 1/16th Native American ancestry.
@sl2111 Don't the Mormons running Ancestry DNA believe in the Native American as a separate category? Contradicts their religion somehow in their opinion?

@dubiousbellbott Who guarantees that?! Certainly not the Constitution nor any amendment to the Constitution. You are misinformed. READ THE 1ST AMENDMENT!!! It only limits CONGRESS in its lawmaking powers. If you can't speak in general, BOO HOO. But CONGRESS can't make a law restricting speech.
@LeviP34 Facebook &amp; Twitter are incapable of violating your 1st amendment rights including the mischaracterized freedom of speech. THEY ARE NOT CONGRESS!  The 1A restricts Congress's lawmaking power &amp; no more. Freedom from certain types of laws IS YOUR ONLY 1ST AMENDMENT RIGHT! GET IT?!
@Marine_1976 We should be able to do all of those things. The freedom of association is fundamental, but we have eroded it perhaps irreparably. The Public Accommodations Act for instance. To combat the racism of private parties, we sacrificed all of the above &amp; more. #MAGA #tcot #ccot
@vetnav6 Where is the right to free speech found in the Constitution?
@calfcreek_2 All irrelevant to the question and the 1st amendment, much less the "free speech" part of the 1st Amendment. Shows 0 understanding.

I KNOW it's tempting to call me a tyrant since I may have said something sometime that you disagreed with, but have I ever truly MADE you do anything? Could I thru the Twitterverse? The answer is obvious, so YES is obviously wrong.
Yes, a restriction on Congress is an immunity, but the REASON for the NO is that I'M NOT CONGRESS. The Constitution places few restrictions on any individual. It places almost all of them on some government agency. I can't own you as a result of the 13A is the only one I recall.

@ProudInfidelGal Also Trump though apparently not a coreligionist on the matter of Grace, he is still Chritian-friendly, which is a welcome change. Also, he has been bolder in his support for Israel than ay other President.
@ProudInfidelGal You should refocus on McConnell. He is the real villain.
@ProudInfidelGal Frankly the decline in our military overodeall other considerations. Watch the September battle to see if he is still serious enough about some issues to go to the mat over them.
@ProudInfidelGal Trump has opened the way to interstate commerce in health insurance offered to associations. I wish he would stress the interstate commerce aspect even more, but he did try. I'm glad he failed because of the Medicaid concessions. Compulsory individual insurance is over though.
@ProudInfidelGal Trump has not allowed us to suffer from any of the unequal provisions of that Treaty has he? He has allowed &amp; encouraged the EPA to lighten &amp; reverse many regulations.
@ProudInfidelGal Well, it was magnanimous not to pursue the loser in the election. HOWEVER since Hillary &amp; and her allies are unwilling to accept that election, he is now open to pursuing her misdeeds
@ProudInfidelGal Could yu expand on that?
@ProudInfidelGal He stil prefers bilateral agreements as do I. He said the TPP deal would have to be a lot better before he would consider it. DACA was part of a deal of reforming immigration in the bargain which the other side refused.
@ProudInfidelGal So you are opposed to American investment abroad? Just like trade investment may be two way. It is the balance that is important just as Micawber ssaid about personal finances. I 've always distrusted the "America 1st" types who appear selfish &amp; Unchristian. He just wants fair.
@ProudInfidelGal Leaving personal morality aside, what is your major policy beef with Trump?
@ProudInfidelGal I am not GOP BTW, but rather an American Independent Party member, so that aversion of yours is irrelevant to me. I certainly found sufficient grounds to leave the GOP Feb 15, 2007.
@ProudInfidelGal Many promises require legislation, but I have the contrary impression. When I was interviewed about why my 3rd Party nominated Trump I was able to give 14 reasons based on his promises off the top of my head. Most of those he delivered on or tried to or is in the process of doing

@traciidavis What I find is that they are unprofitable as prospect lists. When I hover over the account, I see that I've already followed them 95% of the time, so it's a waste of time for me. This may not apply to others who have not aggressively followed Trump supports as I have.

@elliss2sue @TwitterSupport I think that it was the effect of calling for translation &amp; leaving that on. Translation messes with hashtags &amp; unpredictable other things. I've tested this. it's weird, but probably not the result of a malignant plot.
Caution to everyone. When you get a translation of any page, Twitter automatically changes what you type in unpredictable ways, so either close the page or go back to "Original" if that option is still on-screen.

Phases of Due Process: 1, Suspicion' accusation or spontaneous confession. 2. Investigation. 3. Apprehension or surrender. 4. Charging. 5. Trial. 6. Sentencing. 7. Correctional procedures. #MAGA #tcot #taparty #ccot
A poll respondent said: "Due" in the context of "due process of law" means that which is owed. Government is obliged to respect certain legal and procedural norms--it may not act with impunity.

If someone answers "No" we have anarchy. So the correct answer is a "Yes." And of course such an extreme act depriving someone of life must be by due process which in this case is very abbreviated, but still due process. if done lawfully. #MAGA #tcot #teaparty #ccot
Due process of law is an absolute REQUIREMENT. But what is the process? 1. Suspicion or accusation. 2. Investigation. 3. Arraignment 4. Trial 5. Sentence. 6. Punishment. All must be done lawfully. Each has its own process. So a righteous shoot IS due process. https://t.co/rih8MIdErS

@Bishopman69 @Biospine @29_sha The dog needed rescuing. The roo didn't run off. It stood up &amp; stood its ground. Roos box each other all the time. It'd probably had much harder hit than that one in its time. THAT is what was going on.

@TLHarris44 @nolights666 @29_sha They can rip your gut out with their hind claws. That's why the dude backed off before the roo could collect its meager wits &amp; kick him.
@Biospine @29_sha The roo stood up in boxing mode. It just got out-boxed. No harm to the roo. The dog was rescued. They dude got out of kicking range &amp; invited the roo to leave, which he did. Happy ending for all.

"Line item vetoes" can appear as part of a negotiating process NOT as a part of the final veto or signature of a bill. A "bill" is the atom of legislation. It cannot be divided by a "line item veto" UNLESS each "LINE" is actually a separate bill. #MAGA #tcot #teaparty #ccot
"Line item vetoes" are unconstitutional. That is what #SCOTUS say &amp; they are right. No Congressional bill or other legislative act can change that. HOWEVER, there are ways to effectively do just that. I thought of 6 variations without breaking a sweat. Chris Matthews couldn't.

@Plantagenet00 Surely you do not refer to the Catholic faith?! I saw NOTHING spiritual in your tweet stream, but much approbation of vile nonsense.
@Plantagenet00 You Progressive laddies'll be getting a fair comeuppance in short order. The evil schemes of the Obama Regime'll come to naught &amp; many who now preen themselves'll become bitter clingers to their delusions of "social justice" which're nothing of the sort, but base collective theft
@Plantagenet00 Perhaps this https://t.co/wvIYFx4Iuv is what he said on boating of superior knowledge. Was that the work you had in mind? I read it through and it contains the Gospel. I am now interested in Saint Basil. Thanks for inciting my inquiry.

@Plantagenet00 Moreover, Envy is wanting what is not yours (See 10th "Commandment") and Jealousy is wanting to keep what IS yours. Useful distinctions? Yes &amp; necessary to any competent discussion of rights &amp; duties, the meat &amp; potatoes of ethics &amp; morality AND POLITICS!
@Plantagenet00 This is not boasting Dick. It's exasperation. There is a delusion that freedom is good. Personally, I prefer a seat belt. Freedom can be good or bad. Liberty, on the other hand, is good freedom or in other words, freedom to do what is not forbidden.
@armanwalker Riddle me this Smart Guy, why do the Declaration of Independence &amp; the Preamble to the Constitution use "liberty" as a universal good, yet only particular freedoms are secured in the Constitution &amp; even liberties can be removed by due process of law?
@armanwalker So the Bible has the Decalog, the Ten Words, the last of which is summarized as "Thou shalt not envy." That was so scary that the Children of Israel booked. And God is said to be a jealous God. So the Bible is saying he forbids us to be what He is?! Also, BE LIKE JESUS!
Or ask me to distinguish them, if you are just puzzled or think I'm wrong, that they are synonyms. But if you don't think most anarchists &amp; communists are atheists, don't bother.
If you think freedom &amp; liberty are synonyms, you're probably an atheist anarchist/libertarian. If you think jealousy &amp; envy are synonyms, you're probably an atheist progressive/communist. If you're offended, ask me to distinguish them. #MAGA #tcot #teaparty #ccot

The #DPRK's leader cannot afford a long absence for fear of being overthrown in his absence. His overriding priority's to maintain personal power, something more important to him than the interests of his regime or the interests of the people of North Korea. #MAGA #tcot #teaparty
The location of the meeting between the Presidents of the US &amp; the #DPRK needs to be very close by the #DPRK &amp; of short duration because Kim Jung Un cannot afford to be gone long, or he risks losing power. We must take this into account as part of Kim's overriding priority. #MAGA
the first element in ANY deal with the #DPRK is a HAND OVER OF ALL OFFENDING MATERIALS, NUCLEAR &amp; ICBM. Any destruction in place MUST BE CONDUCTED BY THE UNITED STATES.  #MAGA #tcot #teaparty #ccot
Those who talk about verification of an agreement with #DPRK miss the 1st step, THE DELIVERY OF ALL NUCLEAR PROGRAM MATERIALS TO THE US FOR STORAGE. They must also deliver their ballistic missile program material or allow us to destroy it in place. THEN we verify NO RESTART.
@4equalityMoore I want an advance!

Are we heading for a new #CIVILWAR? Californians talk of Secession, of splitting their State in various ways, have Sanctuary cities &amp; now have a Hyper-Sanctuary State using laws that NULLIFY US Immigration Law &amp; INTERPOSE State FORCE to prevent its execution. #MAGA @TuckerCarlson https://t.co/pS8Iz5XtXC
.@TuckerCarlson has started to call the Sanctuary State acts &amp; laws in CA "INSURRECTION." I wonder if he realizes the implications of that due to the Provisions of Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment punishing oath-bound official committing it with loss of office? #MAGA #tcot
Notice that all Constitutionally oath-bound officials (all elected, all judicial &amp; some appointed) are deprived of ALL PUBLIC OFFICES AT WHATEVER LEVEL PERMANENTLY! Unless forgiven by 2/3rds of both houses of Congress of course. That's POLITICAL CAPITAL PUNISHMENT! #MAGA #tcot
"But Congress may by a vote of 2/3rds of each House, remove such disability."		So Governor Brown, the Mayor of Oakland, the State Attorney General &amp; the State Legislature COULD be forgiven if they could get the support of 2/3rds of both Houses of Congress! Good luck with that.
"or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof...
"No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President &amp; Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the US, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the US, ...
Interposition &amp; warning of ICE raids by CA crosses the threshold of posturing nullification declarations &amp; surly refusals of cooperation into INSURRECTION. The Constitution had a penalty for that enacted Post-Civil-War in the 14th Amendment, Section 3 whose text follows:
A further outrage by CA is a law imposing State inspections of US illegal immigrant detention facilities. "Illegal immigrant" you know those folks whose existence ON US SOIL IS ILLEGAL. They can exist elsewhere, that's why they are deported, not executed! #MAGA #tcot #ccot
Laws PREVENTING private cooperation with Federal officials in the execution of US immigration law in CA pass the threshold of Nullification (a declaration of the invalidity of US law by a State) to INTERPOSITION of State force to prevent the execution of US law. #MAGA #tcot #ccot
There's talk of "Secession" in California called "Disunion" pre-Civil War. There're policies &amp; even laws implementing what Southern Senator John Calhoun called "Nullification" &amp; "Interposition" in the Pre-Civil-War era. "Interposition" is the use of State FORCE to nullify US law.

People who don't like lists must hate Santa! Why? Remember, he's making a list &amp; checking it twice. Going to find out who's naughty or nice. Well, there's the rub! #TheResistance thinks I'm naughty because I support #POTUS. AND, I say so on my bio. So listed or not, I'm LISTABLE.

@bratNvet Good points.
@bratNvet That's a good use of your "likes file." I use that file to archive my own tweets in a very accessible form without requesting the Tweets archive file from Twitter.
@bratNvet As to what lists are for, the reasons are multiple. The most important is the LIST TWEET STREAM which is created. Since you can SUBSCRIBE to a list, why bother making one unless yours will be so much better or in which you are much more interested? Mine are the best &amp; biggest.
@bratNvet When you RT or use Twitter retweet facilities, you can SAY you don't agree with what you retweet &amp; disclaim responsibility all day long &amp; it doesn't make any difference. A COMMENTED retweet is another matter. You can do that with disapproval up front &amp; center. #MAGA #tcot
@bratNvet That doesn't make much sense to me. Putting your identity, views, affiliations &amp; intents on your profile is your most important Twitter act. Being listed is way trivial. YOU CAN BE LISTED ON THE BACK OF AN ENVELOPE FOR GOODNESS SAKES‚ÄºÔ∏èCan't say I'm sorry for yelling #MAGA #tcot

To remove yourself from anyone's list, block, then refollow as desired. I've purged all objecting to lists from my lists. Their, my &amp; the Trump Supporter community's loss. Such prohibitions are vain. Any malign intent can be implemented using private lists or off-Twitter lists.

@dizzy_montana_ I'm not quick to block at all. I have strong opinions strongly expressed. I may offend those with little tolerance or flexibility, but I think it's mostly thinking I'm in their opposition when in fact I am not. So hastiness &amp; stupidity would be my favorite explanations.
When I'm blocked &amp; I find out about it, I block back. Most of those who've blocked me seem to have done so stupidly since most seem to have a great affinity with me in their bios. I know it can't be BO. It could be that folks are misled somehow. Answers anyone?
