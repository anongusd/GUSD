Peggy and I will continue fighting for every Minnesotan's freedom to join together in strong unions and build better lives for their families. Here in Minnesota, we know that when unions are strong, our state is strong.
They ensure our roads are plowed and our drinking water is safe. They make sure the government runs efficiently and delivers essential services. They are our neighbors and our family.
It‚Äôs important to know who these workers are. They are educators, counselors, corrections workers, nurses, public defenders, prosecutors, emergency responders, and firefighters.
The #SCOTUS today put that in jeopardy by overturning decades of precedent and stripping power from workers across the country. This case is the culmination of a years-long effort by the wealthy to weaken unions, silence workers, and break the backbone of the middle class.

@amandanbabcock @epmurphymn @peggyflanagan @Rebecca_Otto @ZarinaBaber I've worked in Congress to help producers make the transition to organic, build the Farm to School movement, and help young/beginning farmers get their start. Since my first Farm Bill in 2008, I've added nearly a dozen different beginning farmer/rancher provisions into law.
@amandanbabcock @epmurphymn @peggyflanagan @Rebecca_Otto @ZarinaBaber Programs like U of MN's Forever Green can research new crops/cropping systems to help producers diversify, improve water quality. The AGRI fund helps small biz add value to ag products find new markets for the food we grow. As Governor, I'll make sure they're fully funded.
@amandanbabcock @epmurphymn @peggyflanagan @Rebecca_Otto @ZarinaBaber @amandanbabcock - great question!  I joined the Ag Cmte when I got to Congress and have worked on these issues ever since. As governor, I'll bring to the table my long history of advocating for MN agriculture and family farms.

I come from working people. I am labor. I want to be your next organizer-in-chief.
Real freedom is about more than making a living; it‚Äôs also about having time to take a loved one to the doctor, attend a parent-teacher conference and retire in dignity.
Real freedom is the power in our numbers.
Real freedom is standing together in union to negotiate a fair return on work so we can provide for our families.
A lifetime in the workplace has taught me one thing - the right to bargain collectively really boils down to one thing - 	it‚Äôs about freedom - A more real sense of freedom.
I‚Äôve also been a union teacher and a proud member of @EducationMN. I‚Äôve seen the difference a union makes: quality and affordable healthcare, sustainable hours, a livable wage, and so much more.
I saw coworkers injured on the job. One stapled her finger to a tanning bed. Another inhaled fumes from the adhesive and passed out. They were sent home for the rest of the day without pay and told to show up the next day or risk losing their job.
When I was in my early twenties, I worked in a tanning bed factory. The factory wasn‚Äôt unionized, and I saw some terrible stuff. There wasn‚Äôt sick time, and the pay was low.

Join me in standing up to Republicans in the legislature who are following @TimPawlenty‚Äôs lead by putting the wealthiest and big corporations ahead of our students and educators. #mnleg
I have a radical idea for education in Minnesota: fund it. 	Let‚Äôs give educators the resources they need to help students succeed, like access to school psychologists and counselors, smaller class sizes, and up-to-date textbooks.
Tim Pawlenty will put big corporations and the 1% first. They don't need people looking out for them-- our kids, our educators, and our parents deserve better than @TimPawlenty. #mngov
MN is still digging out from the mess Pawlenty left when he was Governor. Under Pawlenty, the burden of funding public schools fell on educators. When educators in MN are spending their own money- nearly $500 every year, per teacher- we've got our priorities wrong.
Republicans in #mnleg are taking a page from @TimPawlenty‚Äôs  playbook. I was in the classroom when Pawlenty was governor and saw first-hand the devastation from the Pawlenty attack on education: 		* $185M in K-12 education cuts	* Thousands of teachers laid off
We should not be in this position, where schools aren't getting the funding they need. Talk isn't enough. We need action, not words, from Republicans in the legislature. #mnleg
As a lifelong teacher, I know just how critical today‚Äôs emergency funding rally is for MN students. I stand in solidarity with all the parents, students, and educators joining together today to make it clear- MNs youth deserve better. #mnleg #angryapples

Started off today with supporters in Mankato. Then brunch in Winona, affordable housing event with @Jacob_Frey in Mpls, house party in SLP, 5 mile run on the Greenway, and off to pickup my daughter from soccer on our way back to Mankato. Spring is here! -TJW
Together we can build coalitions to address the lack of affordable housing. Every Minnesotan deserves a home. This is a human issue, we must see the dignity in each individual and recognize that housing isn‚Äôt a privilege, it‚Äôs a right. #walzflanagan https://t.co/MNO6Lx60eo
Grateful to talk affordable housing this afternoon with experts @SentaLeff, Patina Park of @MIWRC_MN and Tom Streitz. Big thanks to @Jacob_Frey for hosting. https://t.co/NuEro96vs5

Today seems to be a good time to reinforce that I support creating a tax-and-regulate system for adult use marijuana in Minnesota.
To the students across the country participating in the walkout today- we are listening and we support you. Thank you for all your hard work to make progress on gun violence prevention. #NationalSchoolWalkout
Today, I released my 2017 tax returns. In January, I released ten years of returns.		My reason is simple: If you want to represent Minnesota as governor, you should be transparent about your sources of income.		@MNJeffJohnson and @TimPawlenty, will you follow suit?
Stuff like this is why you were a bad governor. 		Dividing Minnesotans on the backs of the most vulnerable is not how we bring our state into the future.		https://t.co/5H3G6KTaYJ
Congratulations @paulthissen, your experience and passion for justice will serve MN well. https://t.co/Oe9z7Kpy6M
Incredibly proud that thousands of Minnesotans - line cooks, educators, correctional officers, electricians and home care workers - have stepped up to take ownership of this campaign. We‚Äôll bet on this team any day of the week. #mngov

2/3 We are honored that many Native leaders have made the time to speak with us during this campaign and develop relationships. We are listening and will continue to do so.
1/3 MN would be a better state if we all understood the value of our Native American tribes. Their history, culture, sovereignty, and rights.
Another day, another attack on educators by a Republican governor. No mention of the sacrifices that educators make for our students every single day. Let's give them the tools they need to improve student outcomes, both in OK and MN. https://t.co/myr75lBHfN

@RISEsisterhood @RepTimWalz I think Jeff Johnson‚Äôs rhetoric is a sad attempt to pander to the Republican base. It represents the worst of dog-whistle politics and it only hurts Minnesotans.

I voted against the continuing resolution because without a vote on #DACA - we risk the future of some of our most vulnerable MNs #DreamActNow 3/3
Today, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan assured us we'll have a vote on #DACA if we reopen the govt. I'm not sure this vote will ever happen. 2/3

What if instead of pushing through a #GOPTaxScam we focused on providing better care for our vets, controlling the costs of healthcare or reducing the opportunity gap in our public schools? #TuesdayThoughts
In DC to vote against the #GOPTaxScam, but my heart is with @seiumn as they fight for workers‚Äô rights in Albert Lea today. Minnesota is strongest when families have economic security - and that‚Äôs all that striking workers and our brothers and sisters in labor are asking for.
Thanks @IndivisibleMN03 - we appreciate all your hard work and advocacy. Great questions and conversation this evening. https://t.co/z6BhGy7rOf

This governor‚Äôs race is a matter of priorities. Our priority is Minnesotans- their success, well being, education, health, and happiness. 7/7	https://t.co/ALDzxnmvhA
We're against tax cuts for the top 1 percent of wage earners, because we‚Äôve been waiting a long time for that first drop to trickle down. 6/7
We're against $300 million dollar tax cuts for ‚ÄúPremium Cigars‚Äù and giveaways to big tobacco. We wish Republicans in Saint Paul were too. 5/7
We‚Äôre for for investing money into medical research and health care, because keeping Minnesotans healthy is a big part of keeping Minnesotans happy. 4/7
We're for fully funding our schools, because without a strong public school system, our future is unclear. 3/7
We're for investing in middle class families, because they are the engine of Minnesota. 2/7
We‚Äôre for One Minnesota, where everyone can have a chance to succeed, whether you‚Äôre from Detroit Lakes or Lake Street. 1/7
Thanks to the educators at @SWLakers for opening their classrooms for me to visit yesterday. https://t.co/n1oiQC99TU

Honored to tell the story of Butch Lewis at a rally to save our pensions this morning in South Saint Paul. Pensions are a promise. https://t.co/j1YFIKxFxG
This tax bill shows us where the GOP stands on education - we should support our educators not penalize them. 4/4
Many educators are still paying off their loans while working and the bill scraps the student loan tax deduction. 3/4
The bill eliminates teachers' ability to deduct the cost of school supplies they've bought with their personal money. 2/4
The GOP tax bill negatively impacts many Minnesotans but unfortunately, educators are some of the worst hit. 1/4

@mngop @The_RGA You better believe I‚Äôm proud of the work we‚Äôve done. No doubt, more needs to be done on veterans issues. But we've decreased vet suicide, increased access to care for vets, fought against sexual assault in the military. I‚Äôll bring that to MN as governor. 2/3
Silence from @mngop on harassment allegations against GOP statehouse members, but @the_RGA found the moral clarity to attack our work on veterans on‚Ä¶.Veterans Day. 1/3

Those who try to divide us- it's a short term win. I believe in One Minnesota.

(6/6) They know that I can be a messenger for the DFL to places that we‚Äôve lost touch with over the past few elections - and win.
(5/6) This attacked was launched for one reason only: the Koch Brothers don‚Äôt want me to be on the ballot for governor next November.
(4/6) I'm proud of our work. We got a better deal. It passed the House 419-0. How often do you hear about something like that anymore?
(3/6): The bill the Koch-backed CVA supported? It was opposed by the major VSOs and nearly 5 mil vets they represent.
(2/6) I‚Äôve worked in a bipartisan way to reform how the VA serves our veterans. We‚Äôve made important strides and we have more work to do.
(1/6) At the risk of being loquacious, let‚Äôs talk about the absurdity of this attack one more time. https://t.co/WvnTHAUtHB
(4/4) Together, we can be the generation that condemns hatred and bigotry to the ash heap of history - we all have work to do.
(3/4) There‚Äôs no space in our America for white supremacists.
(2/4) It‚Äôs up to those of us who value diversity in our communities to stand up and say, with a clear voice, that we draw the line here.
(1/4) What happened last night in Charlottesville is a gut check moment for our nation. White supremacists are feeling emboldened right now.

I stand in solidarity with all our brave #trans troops and the entire #MN #LGBTQ community against this hateful ban. Equality will prevail.
Having served 24 yrs in the Army National Guard, I know that a person's gender or gender identity has no bearing on their ability to serve.
.@realDonaldTrump's ban on #trans troops is shameful and disrespects those who already protect and defend our freedom every day in uniform.
