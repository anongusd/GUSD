In the end, @JeffFlake knows that Kavanaugh is more of a Bush guy than a Trump guy. He was a consensus pick.
It's entirely appropriate for retired justices -- Kennedy, Souter -- to speak out about what's being done to the Judicial Branch at the hands of political hit-squads. It's bad for both parties, terrible for the country, and poisonous for the federal courts.
The Senate Democrats treat this confirmation process like an MMA fight.  The Republicans treat it like a debate tournament. Accommodating a late-in-the-process allegation was a mistake from Day One.  All orchestrated.  So obvious.

It may take the same numbers camping out in St Peter‚Äôs Sq., demanding Francis‚Äôs resignation‚Äîand that of all in leadership who knew and did nothing‚Äîin order for a full accounting and healing to occur.  Will the media bother to report this?
Archbishop Vigano has done right by the Catholic flock and the victims of this evil predation committed, tolerated and hidden by the Church hierarchy.
‚ÄúThe Cardinal, muttering in a barely comprehensible way, admitted that he had perhaps made the mistake of sleeping in the same bed with some seminarians at his beach house, but he said this as if it had no importance.‚Äù
‚ÄúBut finally I learned with certainty [that] Pope Benedict had imposed on Cardinal McCarrick sanctions similar to those now imposed on him by Pope Francis....‚Äù
Vigan√≤ said he chose to write his testimony ‚Äúto discharge my conscience before God of my responsibilities as bishop of the universal Church. I am an old man and I want to present myself to God with clean conscience.‚Äù
‚ÄúPope Francis has repeatedly asked for total transparency in the Church....he must honestly state when he first learned about the crimes committed by McCarrick, who abused his authority with seminarians and priests....‚Äù
‚ÄúFather James Martin, S.J...is nothing but a sad recent example of that deviated wing of the Society of Jesus....‚Äù
‚Äú[Francis] knew from at least June 23, 2013 that McCarrick was a serial predator...he covered for him to the bitter end....‚Äù
"Francis is abdicating the mandate which Christ gave to Peter to confirm the brethren. Indeed, by his action he has divided them, led them into error, and encouraged the wolves to continue to tear apart the sheep of Christ‚Äôs flock...‚Äù
Archbishop Vigan√≤, the former papal nuncio to the US, recounts that he personally told Pope Francis about McCarrick and his reputation in June 2013, five years and two mo‚Äôs ago, and that Pope Francis did nothing.
