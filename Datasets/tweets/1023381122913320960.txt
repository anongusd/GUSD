@goodoldcatchy @alicetsl @UncleEverett @cerealcheatah @Ocasio2018 Liberals name call and insult rather than debate. Typical of those that talk out of their ass and aren't able to have intellectual debate.
@alicetsl @goodoldcatchy @UncleEverett @cerealcheatah @Ocasio2018 No it isn't. You're either lying about living under it or lying period. With Universal health care you lose your choice and are told what you are approved for. There are actual panels that decide if you or your loved ones are worth the treatment or qualify for care.
@goodoldcatchy @alicetsl @UncleEverett @cerealcheatah @Ocasio2018 Not it isn't well said. Why do people in other countries come to the US because we have the best Healthcare if their system is so great? Because universal care killed innovation, research and choice. If they choose not to treat you, you die. The wait list are so long ppl die.
