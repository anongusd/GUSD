@cbiemiller @cologop Would you be willing to clarify your example? I didn‚Äôt quite understand it. Admittedly there‚Äôs only so much we can fit into these.
@cbiemiller @cologop The cost is presently being born by someone. Right now its the people breathing air and they have no say in it. Diverting the costs to the product‚Äôs consumer, whose consumption produces the endangering hazard, seems like the free market working.

@cbiemiller @cologop I hear ya but casting the cost onto the public at large rather than the consumer is a bit ironic for free market defenders to champion. Also saying we can‚Äôt do this everywhere so we shouldn‚Äôt try it anywhere is a bit of a cop out for a country as wealthy as ours is.
@cbiemiller @cologop But we‚Äôre talking about the issue at hand and that‚Äôs who should pay for their own automobile‚Äôs pollution. Making it everyone else‚Äôs problem is something Republicans despise as a default.
