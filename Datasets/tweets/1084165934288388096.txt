@AlBernstein @ShowtimeBoxing @mauroranallo @BCusterTV @PaulMalignaggi @SteveFarhood Actually, no. Abner was not a good opponent either IMO. Abner is tough but, he is still the smaller man. No different from Khan v Canelo or Mikey v Spence. Size matters. But you and Paulie will make it a good show either way.
@AlBernstein @ShowtimeBoxing @mauroranallo @BCusterTV @PaulMalignaggi @SteveFarhood What a shit show of a card. #MayweatherPromotions has some serious work to do in the promotion game. Showtime don’t even have pictures of Ruiz, Zamora or Bogere on thier website for this card. If Mayweather is the future of Boxing promotions, boxing is screwed.

@Samjohns89 @chris14713935 @DillianWhyte @BronzeBomber @lemarscott I agree. I’m no wilder fan. But if he is fighting a foreigner, then I support. And he has no skills. But he will still whoop on AJs ass

@Samjohns89 @chris14713935 @DillianWhyte @BronzeBomber @lemarscott That’s why I do love the Britts. You guys stand behind your man. You chant “ There’s only one ____” I love that. That being said, outside of that noise is usually a fighter who is good. Just not good enough to dominate the sport like we do. That’s all I’m saying.
Happy B-Day Lamont! https://t.co/uYj0EGaltU
@Douglascosta014 @DillianWhyte @BronzeBomber @lemarscott I never said wilder was anything special? All I said was he beats AJ easy within 4rds because of his powerful straight right and AJs lack of defense. Trust me, the heavyweight division died when Mike Tyson Retired. LITERALLY.

@Brooklyn_Boxing @PaulMalignaggi @barclayscenter I love Paulie! He is an excellent commentator. He gives you the fighters perspective. Unlike your typical host who read books and watched old fights, but doesn’t really know what a fighter is thinking at that moment in the ring. But he isn’t perfect. Paulies politics suck ass.😂
@gurney5789 @DillianWhyte @BronzeBomber @lemarscott Fury was Robbed, I agree. And Lewis can eat a dick. If he would have fought Mike before prison, Mike would have destroyed him. He waited until Mike was a shell of his old self. And he takes pride in that win? I love #IronMikeTyson. He is off limit for discussion. Fk Lewis!
@woodyladd14 @DillianWhyte @BronzeBomber @lemarscott Nope. He was bad ass. Only thing I don’t like is the credit he got for beating an old washed up rap jones. Just like that queer #LennoxLewis and #MikeTyson. No credit for that from me.
@smirnoffmachine @peterr250387 @DillianWhyte @BronzeBomber @lemarscott ABSOLUTELY NOT😂😂😂😂😂 AJ is a straight walking human testosterone. He walks you down with hand low. No defense. Wilders signature Two Piece down the pipe will nite nite his ass. Wilders style is made for AJs style. Now Fury! That’s different. He is like a heavyweight Loma lol
