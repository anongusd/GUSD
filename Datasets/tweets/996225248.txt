@RepMarkMeadows @realDonaldTrump hey rep, last I looked Trump's campaign manager has been implicated in sharing information with the Russians. Trump's son had a meeting with the Russians to get dirt on the Hilary campaign and oh Trump lied about building a tower in Moscow...Please shut up so we can unravel this
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump more coathangers...good job
@realDonaldTrump no it's been proven that you broke the law when paying off your mistresses, your campaign manager shared data with Russia and Don Jr, your son clearly committed a crime when meeting Russian offices,etc....#collusion
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump would you say this crap if Donald spat on your cat?
@GeorgePapa19 I sure as hell don't support you...
@RealCandaceO @AOC where's the racial slur....
@simonamangiante @GeorgePapa19 godamm it, we've moved on from mr. coffee
@DLoesch you could look at it that way or we could all come to our senses and realize there's no imaginary man in the sky
@metalphysica @KaitMarieox @joerogan again...you use general accusations instead of digging into the evidence, which seems compelling
@TheJordanRachel wow, you seem to know everything....
@metalphysica @KaitMarieox @joerogan hmm...don't see things your way....you keep on calling mainstream media 'fake news' when of course you don't cite substantiated evidence...
@metalphysica @KaitMarieox @joerogan ok I will...why don't you watch her as well and we can have a decent conversation on what is going on?
@LaundryQueen3 @KaitMarieox @joerogan wow, calling CNN 'fake news'....what a surprise...a common theme of all Trump supporters
@KaitMarieox @joerogan Alex Jones is a conspiracy theorist. Praising him proves that you have no credibility
@realDonaldTrump @Varneyco the only reason why a Republican would not vote to put a up a wall is because they'll get trounced in 2020....otherwise you've made them your bitches.... pathetic party, vile president
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump you mean 44% of the American people?
@lisaellis20179 @Fletcher_Tove @RepMarkMeadows you must love me then because I'm positive there's plenty to come
@RepMarkMeadows no, there is plenty of evidence of real collusion....
@SenatorCollins after the Kavanaugh vote, I'd rather to hear from the fake susan collins than the real one
@TomiLahren agreed....think it's a stupid thing...watching you is a little bit more entertaining (though a little less intellectual)
@jmsilveresq @KaitMarieox got to give it to you...I've tried quite hard to get Kaitlin, the not so phantom poop-star to swear at me but I've failed time and time again....congrats
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump Russia First????
@joncoopertweets Ocasio-Cortez has thick skin...doubt she could care less about this
@DemWrite @PeteButtigieg @tribelaw agreed....should be a position by all candidates
@realDonaldTrump and god willing an impeachment to boot
@Jim_Jordan looks who's talking...you're full of sh_t ALL THE TIME
@realDonaldTrump there are many shreds of evidence that the president has done something wrong
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump would prefer to get pissed on by a Russian prostitute....unfortunately I wouldn't be the first
@webster doesn't surprise me....he blocks people after the slightest of insults...
@LindaSuhler sound like a fascist....cannot believe I share a citizenship with you... in AMERICA
@DonaldJTrumpJr wait a second....aren't you guilty?
@keystoneskiing @RyanAFournier doubtful...but then it will get thrown in Kentucky
@keystoneskiing @RyanAFournier we'll see if the case stays there though I doubt it will....regardless it's a ridiculous case and hopefully will be thrown out
@GeorgePapa19 aren't you guys a walking sh_tshow...love each other one day and then get into a cat fight the next?
@robreiner unfortunately you're right
@RyanAFournier try finding a jury in DC dumb enough to think that the Sandmans are entitled to any money: let alone to that stupid amount....#keepthenewscoming
@KaitMarieox you obviously posted such a silly post to draw attention
@GeorgePapa19 where's your wife?
@realDonaldTrump no, they were figuring out what to do after you obstructed justice, which is illegal
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends wow, you speak out of context....
@Preacher69Kenny @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump then what does that make you? even a retard knows 3+3=6...
@Preacher69Kenny @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump I'm in purgatory....3+3=7 in this dialogue
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump no that is not true....the Russians hacked our national security system
@GeorgePapa19 @RepMarkMeadows you're a has been wannabe that didn't get an opportunity to participate in the conspiracy....#coffeethug
@GerryCallahan Think that about your show while listening to Toucher and Rich
@Jim_Jordan agreed....let's get @DevinNunes  to testify also
@realDonaldTrump suppose we'll see if you can take over the country after the supreme court make their decision on the wall...otherwise you're going to jail
@realDonaldTrump at least they didn't pay somebody to piss on them
@TheJordanRachel if only we could take away your guns...
@JudgeJeanine actually the situation isn't 'unequivocally or undoubtedly' needed
@TomiLahren another comment where you want to look almighty and virtuous
@coleyworld f_ckin' sh_tf_cks!!!!!!!
@GOPChairwoman thanks for pointing out the 'hypocracy'....the issue at hand is if building this wall is 'an emergency' and the vast majority says it's not....that's a fact
@KaitMarieox Kaitlin, you don't know what you're talking about. The barriers voted on are not nearly as substantial as this silly wall
@ChatByCC @DonaldJTrumpJr @LindaSuhler @realDonaldTrump wow you're playing victim...last I looked your party's in control
@ChatByCC oh really....thought there was a process where it passed congress and the senate
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump that would make you a moron....
@TomiLahren thanks for sharing this freak with us
@KaitMarieox @IlhanMN Imagine spewing ridiculous right wing crap that aspires to make America as fascist and misinformed as Erdogan's government ....I'm looking at you @kaitlinbennet
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump no....we know that they there was collusion....we do not know if Trump knew about conspiracy
@KaitMarieox @LoganPaul wow, the Logan Paul podcast!!!!! wait a sec....who the f_ck is Logan Paul
@krassenstein don't know I looked up to a lot of presidents but of course I don't look up to Trump
@TomiLahren oh really....through my eyes Trump has actually tried to become a dictator and you're too dense, too opportunistic and too full of yourself to figure this out
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump I guess I'm not smart enough to realize that either because I think it's an absolutely stupid piece of reasoning
@realDonaldTrump no, you've ridden Obama's economy
@Jim_Jordan @AdamSchiff no, not at all....Nunes is a lawmaker who snuck into the White House at 12:00 and probably disclosed an investigation to the person they're investigating
@realannapaulina what a stupid observation....we all know that the Dems became Republicans
@RealCandaceO @ChelseaClinton and you've been advocating, a world class pervert, con artist, b level businessman, unfortunate president.....WOW
@realDonaldTrump you mean we have a great economy after Obama brought it back up and you've done everything to piss on it
@realDonaldTrump you're praising a goddamn dictator....you f_ckin' douche
@realannapaulina @POTUS 50% of Hispanics do not support the president
@RepJeffries please keep on working on our behalf...it would be a shame if the truth doesn't come out
@SenatorCollins keep up with your moderate bullsh_t....you were still the deciding vote on the Kavanaugh confirmation that will ultimately destroy Roe v Wade...hoping Maine will get rid of you before too long
@KaitMarieox @AOC have you been to planet earth? do you understand protocols? GOP cannot expel her from congress...they don't have the majority/let alone the requisite votes to get rid of her
@coleyworld don't like people flicking off their elders....but what else is there to do if Matt Gaetz is around?
@SenatorCollins 		you better comment on Kavanaugh's breaking precedent when you told us he wouldn't
@SenatorCollins let's put your stupid lobster aside and talk about your vote for Kavanaugh...the judge that assured you he'd uphold precedent
@senatemajldr wouldn't mention spite...us liberals will never forgive you for stonewalling Garland....trolling us more only put oil on the fire
@RepMarkMeadows the last thing I'm thinking about is that little wannabe....let's focus on Trump's dealing with Russia
@jtomase that's crap....those trades will essentially do nothing once the 8 player line ups get solidified
@realDonaldTrump I'm sure it was well received...the people that know you're full of sh_t didn't watch it because....they knew you would be full of sh_t
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump and you're from Mars
@DailyCaller who cares? it's a start...
@senatemajldr you're full of sh_t....completely full of sh_t
@KatrinaPierson not a horrible point...now why don't you tell us your opinion on both cases
@Jim_Jordan great point....now tell what are you going to do about our environment that gets more f_cked up by the day?
@kayleighmcenany @instagram @washingtonpost I don't know some of the things you say are so stupid I'm thinking Twitter is finding a convenient excuse to shut you up....
@RepAdamSchiff @RepJoeKennedy with all due respect congressman aren't you from the boston area?
@KatrinaPierson what about the republican's racist present?
@krassenstein no, no, the guards will lead the way
@mitchellvii @AOC yeah he's a real chess master
@KimStrassel wow you're citing a fox news poll, what a surprise
@AnnCoulter you sound mad...
@DonaldJTrumpJr The BS? Wow, last I looked Ms. Ilhan isn't trying to cover up conspiracy with Russia
@KaitMarieox oh how cute, another picture of you with a firing object
@johncardillo and you're full of sh_t
@TomiLahren @21savage I sincerely doubt you know anything about the law
@JohnnyChildres @KaitMarieox wow, what a simple response. I guess I'll be a little clearer....she does shallow things to enhance her career and yes capitalism allows one to that much of the time...with that said, I do feel obliged not to be quiet but to call her out on it because she does influence people
@DavidWohl you're full of sh_t when it comes to politics and what a surprise you're full of sh_t when it comes to football...enjoy the special season by boy genius
@BenVolin I'd be good with that
@TomiLahren Wish they deported you....
@TheJordanRachel obviously a stupid comment....you're comparing a two thousand mile border to a man made stadium
@realDonaldTrump oh mr conman you're full of sh_t.....again
@tedcruz are f_ckin'....the guy's getting massacred by the media
@GOPChairwoman great points....now please list the president's tainted history
@GerryCallahan yeah now you seem to have an opinion about this....so happy you can share it with us
@TheJordanRachel yeah you seem to know exactly what happened (and I always thought you were a Republican hack that will only take shots at Democrats)
@ChatByCC trust me all us watchers of CNN know that Northam's a democrat....unlike Fox news watchers we're already informed so if there's a mistake made in reporting, we know it is
@realannapaulina on what planet do you live on...hearing nothing but outraged and panic democrats calling for his resignation
@LouMerloni not sure Tatum is on the table
@SIChrisMannix no doubt
@TheJordanRachel no....we actually all know that Northam is a democrat...believe it or not CNN making that mistake would not confuse us like it would viewers of other stations
@wojespn not a bad offer...just add Ingram and Lakers have a deal
@YeahImRashad @foresstgunk @LilThotGun @JoshReynolds24 If teams more or less can sign two max players than everybody but Porter seems like a top 60 player to me and plenty of people will argue that I'm wrong about Porter
@YeahImRashad @foresstgunk @LilThotGun @JoshReynolds24 even if he's a borderline allstar, which I think is selling him short, wouldn't that still make him a max player? Ie Harrison Barnes, Kyle Lowry, Otto Porter, Bradley Beale, Jrue Holliday,, Paul Milsap, Hassan Whiteside, Serge Ibaka...
@foresstgunk @LilThotGun @JoshReynolds24 maybe....though the guy loves the limelight...think Clippers, Knicks, Mavericks and the ultimate wildcard Bulls might entice him
@dovan0321 @TygressKat @IanBegley @wojespn well if you're a Clippers fan you might be a very happy person...
@DavidWohl what does it feel like to be constantly full of sh_t?
@SenAlexander @POTUS do you mean that we've seen the potus taking credit for Obama's long, grinding work which was f_cked up in the 1st place by another republican?
@RayanMansour @NateSilver538 agreed not a league where superstars are traded for superstars...though not sure he won't jettison to the knicks once season's over
@RayanMansour @NateSilver538 don't want Kemba...not a superstar
@realannapaulina @IlhanMN well, other than the standard rate that you pay when you reach the 90% bracket and oh yeah, the luxury to use your wealth to accumulate more wealth by simply investing your money (I won't mention that only .01% will actually ever reach this bracket in the first place)
@realDonaldTrump then sit down and talk with the goddamn council
@DonaldJTrumpJr but Russia is still unresolved
@TomiLahren good luck with the Trump 2020 thing....thinking you need him to stick around or you'll probably lose your job
@New2018World @HuffPost yeah I just don't see it
@TomSteyer @HowardSchultz glad to see you realize that wealth needs to be fluid or we can't have wealth at all.....
@DonaldJTrumpJr why does he need to leak? We all know you had a meeting to collude with Russian
@KaitMarieox what are the demands of the leftist mob?
@KellyannePolls wtf....thought that the president got impeached!!!! please don't get my hopes up
@Twinmom0 @KaitMarieox no, she's a little bit better...there's comic relief
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump you mean the economy created by president obama?
@DavidWohl @CBSThisMorning @JeffFlake @CBSNews sort of similar to you though he's not a full time troll
@realDonaldTrump oh what a surprise...once someone is out the door you vilify them
@Bodega4life @richg6567 @FlutoShinzawa this year he's been close to shutdown defender no doubt....agree he's better than Chara right now...disagree about the prospects...think they both have a chance to get on a third line...still think Toronto's making a bold move
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump wonder if that makes him a renaissance man?
@FlutoShinzawa steep price
@DonaldJTrumpJr for somebody under intense investigation you're a high up on your high horse
@realDonaldTrump for some reason I'm guessing you're full of sh_t....you want to know why?	because you're ALWAYS FULL OF SH_T
@mistydawnu just want Trump to go suck dust...do not care who does it, whether they're male, female, black, blue, yellow or invisible....
@MarkBluecheck @KaitMarieox I'll agree to disagree...all reporters have biases and I'll agree that the vast majority are liberal but they don't walk around and find some doofus to say incendiary things....conservative or liberal: people are better than that
@MarkBluecheck @KaitMarieox no most reporters don't do that....Kait has agenda, which good reporters do not have
@GrassrootsSpeak agreed...let's shame them before they get deeper into the race
@ericswalwell @HowardSchultz @realDonaldTrump yeah you're in the minority...let's be pragmatic...Schultz takes votes away from the good candidate
@HowardSchultz please don't run....Trump needs to go and your presence would screw that up
@SebGorka @KayaJones @salem Kaya Jones, Sebastian Gorka...might as well get Chuck Woolery, Scott Baio, Kristy Swanson, Victoria Jackson together for a C-list trump celebrity orgy
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump not a bad point; though it's better than the alternative, which is voting for a party that lines the pockets of corporate america and oh yeah....it doesn't protect our biggest adversary, Russia
@GOPChairwoman Reason why the GOP candidates will lose in 2020: They're so goddamn delusional
@charliekirk11 that's obviously not true.....
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump hmmm I'm American and I don't think this
@FFRF great thought...
@RealSaavedra but there IS evidence that there was collusion with Russia and Donald Trump HAS passed legislation clearly beneficial to Russia
@RepLeeZeldin good, glad you live in NY to contribute to their education
@vito_ralph @KaitMarieox yikes, grade a dumbass
@GlobeChadFinn Adrian Dantley, KC Jones, Bill Walton, Calvin Murphy, Bill Bradley....wouldn't be surprised to Chauncey
@vito_ralph @KaitMarieox Race? what the f_ck are you talking about, dumbass
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump wow you're the president's lackey...don't know if you can handle living much longer unless you get to clean up his sh_t
@phil_luttazi @KaitMarieox yeah perhaps I had the wrong choice of words
@JohnnyChildres @KaitMarieox don't think so....engaging these people lessons their platform (no matter how batty it is)
@vito_ralph @KaitMarieox 'blah,blah,blah'.....what the f_ck is that supposed to mean?
@JohnnyChildres @KaitMarieox not the crap that she reports
@KaitMarieox that's not what he said...he said that you are trying to find people to say things just so you and your agenda can look good and he's right. And I'll one up him; you're egotistical and selfish and you're doing these stupid video clips to enhance your career
@charliekirk11 notice how you left out the 22 year times span and in effect made it a bigger deal than it is
@charliekirk11 that we got a russian agent in the white house
@StephenLimbaugh no
@charliekirk11 these facts are bullsh_t....because you are lying to us over a public forum that makes you despicable
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump hopefully the court system will pee on that draft
@AnnCoulter you are so cute with that wimp talk....when so many people and their families aren't getting paid
@DavidWohl you're calling our dear leader a wimp....that's so adorable!!!!!!!
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump national emergency!!???? and wtf are you smoking?
@JackPosobiec Oh really....isn't that similar to what was said about the Cohen raid?
@JackPosobiec just don't think the investigation's going in that direction
@RepJerryNadler think he knew just about everything...it's these doofuses that hardly knew anything
@realDonaldTrump an okay point, I do a brief shout out to @BarackObama
@TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump he's already communicated 'our need for a wall' several hundred times...and many of us think he's a dumb ass for doing it
@TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump Tomi, that would be a good thing...if Donald Trump doesn't get a 2nd term then your voice would lose so much credibility
@StellasDad12 @KaitMarieox you nailed me...I guess some doofus said that....still that's one example, which Ms. Bennett is attributing to liberals' attitudes in general, which at best is ridiculous but more accurately is f_cked up.
@KaitMarieox don't think liberal has said anything remotely close to that
@ryanstruyk not surprised...that's where smart people live and any smart person would acknowledge that Trump is a doofus
@JudgeJeanine and you're only interest in making money...that's why you spew bullsh_t all day
@KaitMarieox 'left-wing mob,' 'ruin your life' You got to have better hyperbole than that crap...
@BenVolin how could he screw that up?
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I'm an American....I don't recognize that.
@RepMarkMeadows last I looked people wearing a MAGA hat most likely voted for the president
@KaitMarieox talk about acting like a little lamb in the middle of a bunch of big bad wolves...
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson trust me when you lift those export sanctions on Putin, Putin will become the largest oil exporter again (and of course you'll just continue to be his bitch)
@PeteAbe if Mussina's gets in, Schilling has to be in too
@5K_Ohm_Resistor @simonamangiante she looks a little lost in something
@TomiLahren and your lack of intellect never disappoints me
@mitchellvii that's funny you say that because I think she gets an A
@luztotal2 @Christeenm75 @lwags13 @CovfefeDem4DJT @slReilly @Cernovich ...of course I cannot (or anyone else) read those kids' minds. Nevertheless it looked like mockery to me
@eye_eden @slReilly @Cernovich why? because you're native american, that gives you justification to call my remarks 'racist?'  What hollow logic....
@lwags13 @Christeenm75 @CovfefeDem4DJT @slReilly @Cernovich you got a point about them not approaching the kids...doesn't excuse the kid's mockery however
@eye_eden @slReilly @Cernovich Mr. Woodwind, never have I speculated who you are or what you do...what a stupid and baseless remark....
@MicheleHay2 @Cernovich just watched the video again...I see the drummer near the kid but they're forming a semi-circle and the drummer is not locking eyes with the kid
@Christeenm75 @luztotal2 @lwags13 @CovfefeDem4DJT @slReilly @Cernovich don't agree with that...as I said there were plenty of moments the kids acted maturely....not even saying the kid should've walked away...he could've raised his arms in confusion, could've looked stoic but there was a lot of mockery, including that smile
@stevenov1947 @Cernovich two could play this...you're a meathead conservative....doesn't get us anywhere
@lwags13 @Christeenm75 @CovfefeDem4DJT @slReilly @Cernovich come on, a bunch of old men with drums and the kids are dancing freely...they knew they were harmless
@lwags13 @Christeenm75 @CovfefeDem4DJT @slReilly @Cernovich would you really have escalated a conflict when the group was just being weird, not harmless? (I really hope not)
@lwags13 @Christeenm75 @CovfefeDem4DJT @slReilly @Cernovich I don't know how to respond to this except to reiterate what the video suggests; they were mocking the chants and being belligerent when the drummers were ultimately harmless.
@Christeenm75 @lwags13 @CovfefeDem4DJT @slReilly @Cernovich from what I saw it was a weird display by the drumming circle....the leader of course said he wanted to intervene with the kids and the Israelites. With that said, the kid shouldn't smile and the other kids can't mock the drumming...that crosses a line
@lwags13 @Christeenm75 @CovfefeDem4DJT @slReilly @Cernovich not making a native american reference- just an older guy with a drum. Indeed it was an awkward situation but still saw mockery from the kids after I saw some of them acting mature. We have examples of how to and not to act from watching these same kids throughout the video.
@Christeenm75 @CovfefeDem4DJT @slReilly @Cernovich you got a point. He isn't fully mature at 16. I'll give him some leeway though we saw some maturity from these kids when they didn't engage the Israelites who were saying some stupid things to them at first. Think he was trying to get under the drummer's skin.
@CovfefeDem4DJT @Christeenm75 @slReilly @Cernovich don't think so....I'm engaging in a decent discussion....it you don't want to engage then don't say anything....
@Christeenm75 @slReilly @Cernovich you don't smile in an elder's face when he's playing a drum...the aesthetics look absolutely stupid and condescending...if he wanted to show defiance he could've stood there with a plain look (like many of them did at first when the Israelites were screaming crap their way.)
@slReilly @Cernovich I watched the whole video...protesters should never have gotten up into the kids face but the kids were being absolutely ridiculous. You don't stand and smirk in anybody's face.
@suzystays congrats....I try to say many belligerent things but she doesn't seem to acknowledge me ):
@Cernovich we saw these kids act belligerent and the kid smiling in the face of the protester. Just don't see these kids innocence....
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump thanks for the very simple metaphor
@realDonaldTrump was it or are you lying (again)?
@realDonaldTrump not well because of president @AnnCoulter
@TomiLahren @KamalaHarris you're like a common cold....you say so many things that don't stick but they're enough dumb asses out there that take your word like it's the plague
@cpriceNFL let's hope there's 8
@DavidWohl @CNN wondering why don't you try to monetize all your trolling....
@TomiLahren on another note Cardi B should be a household name...whereas Tomi Lahren should be a waitress at a Ruby Tuesdays
@matthewschmitz don't think I want anyone fired though evidence is clear cut enough that the kids acted stupid
@BKactual see no evidence from this tape that the kids are doing anything but acting stupid
@TomiLahren @iamcardib and I acknowledge that you're a certified dumb ass but somehow you get a podium to utter your crap
@Cernovich what's your point? the left will weaponize this because there were a bunch of dumb ass kids that knew they were on camera and were mocking Native Americans....
@realDonaldTrump why? you offered to take 5.7 billion for the wall before shutting down the government and yesterday your offer was 5.7 billion...seems obvious to me (and other pragmatic people) she wouldn't accept it
@PeteHegseth you got a point; though last I looked rightist propaganda crap is a much greater threat to our democracy
@Nandrews508 @AdamHimmelsbach shouldn't be anything more than that....he was held back before he punched anyone
@simonamangiante it's great to see he's doing work on such a prominent person so we can continue to love her public pictures as well as listen to her beautiful thoughts
@kayleighmcenany no the proposal actually sucks and something the dems have said they wouldn't do time and time again
@GOP @realDonaldTrump maybe reopen the government then the dems should come to the table
@AriFleischer not all the false bombshells are anti trump....have you watched Foxnews lately?
@SenatorCollins you are a craft...hopefully Maine people will see through your postering anf your survival tactics and get rid of you
@SenatorRomney @POTUS you're forgetting one thing 5 billion dollars is not reasonable
@DavidWohl @CNN @MSNBC ok and we only hear from Fox, The Dear Leader Network...great idea
@DonaldJTrumpJr @BuzzFeedBen for someone under investigation you're a little bit cocky....we'll see where Buzz Feed is in 2 months and we'll where you are in two months....
@DonaldJTrumpJr @Amy_Siskind How is Amy an imbecile?...your father is the only president that's literally tried to become a dictator and that's why we're fighting the thug (your father)
@KellyannePolls Kelly, we wouldn't be having these conversations if the white was forthcoming but I suppose that's not going to happen
@DonaldJTrumpJr for some reason I don't think this story's going away....we'll see in time what the truth is
@DavidWohl substance? looks who's talking mr. troll
@KaitMarieox so you want anarchy? good luck being taken seriously
@WanViking1 @BillOReilly and you're still full of sh_t
@KaitMarieox @SpeakerPelosi it's immoral....public officials do it all the time....
@WanViking1 @BillOReilly 'show some respect.'  'dems support human and drug trafficking. Voter fraud.'... You're full of sh_t.
@WanViking1 @BillOReilly Bengazi already beat the dead horse....this is a real live story. Let's bring it on.
@BillOReilly Bill, there are real stories about the president that indicate his corruption. Maybe we should be objective in finding out if he really is corrupt. If he's not then we can call the media hostile.
@DavidWohl looks who's talking Mr. 24/7 troll?
@STEPHMHAMILL what's your point....McConnell's still a puss...cannot stand up to the president
@PhilipRucker yeah save for the corroborating evidence Mueller has
@MichaelRCaputo buzzfeed or whatever feed, it's what Michael Cohen told the special council and the special council has corroborating evidence....president colluded...it's proven
@LindseyGrahamSC what a profound remark but hold on a second, aren't you part of the majority party that could override the president's veto?
@SaraCarterDC @RichardGrenell what a great picture!!!! now why don't you comment on the buzz feed story?
@GeorgePapa19 @dbongino @BernardKerik yeah those are high class thugs...thank god they're there for you
@DavidWohl really, please name a case of yours....for some reason I think you might be more of a conman than the president
@mike_pence why? should we respect the invisible man in the sky?
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump no, collusion has been proven, it's more than likely that the president got pissed on and Mueller actually is the guy that's protecting the president when the rest of us want to roast him and oh yeah you're full of sh_t
@RudyGiuliani Rudy, from the president's action, we all know he's compromised...you're a stooge to put it mildly
@KaitMarieox thank God for Twitter...it reminds me that even with all the horrible politically correct bullsh_t uttered out there, your bullsh_t and all right wing bullsh_t is so much worse
@realDonaldTrump maybe...though at least they're not Russian agents
@KaitMarieox think that's the first time I've seen you without a gun....though you still were extra obnoxious in that video
@SherCerLub @Lrihendry well I was using a little hyperbole...nonetheless us blue staters are much more economic creating than red staters... Perhaps one day we'll separate into two countries? You'd see us leave red states in the dust but of course nobody on the right wishes to acknowledge this #jealous
@Lrihendry good point....I see something similar to this when us blue states carry the asses of the red states....
@ChatByCC what about the facts and that they point towards the president's guilt
@Jim_Jordan sort of interested in the Nunes investigation. Can you post anything related to that?
@KayaJones @realDonaldTrump wow your blind spot is huge and getting even bigger!!!!!
@RealJamesWoods really....you want to do this be my guest
@Jim_Jordan @RepJerryNadler @POTUS agree with you and those issues were taken care of....
@realDonaldTrump oh I doubt that....Hispanics were a big reason why many of your cronies got kicked out
@lauferlaw cool can't wait to read them
@realDonaldTrump hmmmm, it's been proven that this is not true....you did have plans to build a tower in Moscow, a oligarch DID buy a property of yours for 50mm more than it was worth, the Steele report was written because you kept on going to Moscow
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump are you kidding?..more like 100 times than this conman...think about how poor Trump and his kids will be when they have all this litigation to fend off against. think these lawsuits will be over 50 million dollars
@DJ_Bean he didn't come so prepared in the 1st half...they had no ball control on most of those drives
@DavidWohl nobody's disputing that....now we have a disturbed, demented man in office
@DJ_Bean yeah, same old mental mistake cowboys under Garrett
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump you're inferring the dems are corrupt when we got president Trump...good luck with that
@stikwith @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump due to lack of space cannot speak to everything you just said but will say this...Just saw Bongino on Judge Judy and he said that this investigation 'is nonsense.' That's propaganda of course because this investigation has resulted in convictions and indictments.
@stikwith @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump what do you mean?...all those networks are taking this investigation very seriously and reporting on the significance of stories that arise unlike Fox....for example several fox commentators calling the trump tower meeting, 'a nothing burger' is deceptive at best
@stikwith @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump in my interpretation I did but we're playing semantics....let's not do that....you want to have a dialogue, I brought up a topic where I think Fox has misinformed its viewers....
@stikwith @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump what? I gave you a response.
@stikwith @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump where do you want me to begin? by listing every lie Fox has told? think its constant cynicism of possible wrongdoing by the president's campaign is the clearest example when this story is serious.
@stikwith @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump sure there's left wing spin....Fox lies
@Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump I agree. Fox news should be banned for the crap it reports
@JillWineBanks @merce2me @MalcolmNance @LawProfButler @maddow @Lawrence @HechtCs @vegasbanks @robreiner it's really up to Justice Roberts to make that official
@realDonaldTrump this is coming from compromised conman Donald
@realDonaldTrump I'd rather discuss you being a Russian agent.....
@realannapaulina thanks for the simple lesson though I prefer to live in non-marshall state and I'd like Mexico's economy to improve so we don't have human trafficking or these dumb drug prevention discussions
@_Michelangelo__ @realDonaldTrump 2020? how about creating a diversion to the Russian scandal?
@realDonaldTrump no you haven't....you've actually don't nothing....the sanctions that Obama passed practically bankrupted their country...your sanctions targeted certain individuals and companies
@ThinBlueLine614 why would Mexico want to stop the intellectuals from coming?
@realDonaldTrump you're a crook
@realDonaldTrump actually when you fired him, we further suspected that you were involved with the Russians and nothing has changed....very excited to read the Mueller report
@DavidWohl after this is all said and done, you might be the biggest dumba_ss cheerleader for Trump, which is obviously saying a lot
@SebGorka @Acosta @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @conservmillen @seanhannity @FoxNews @FoxNewsInsider @foxnewsalert @foxnewspolitics no he didn't. He was being a reporter and a very good one at that.
@realDonaldTrump right now I'm listening to how the FBI investigated whether you were working for Russia, which you were
@SethAbramson we sort of already knew that the president's guilty....but I suppose we have to have act surprised by all this
@missy_zaccaro @GOPChairwoman it's not that there is a problem, it's that it's pointless
@chickles @Lrihendry I'm not from here?  What are you talking about?
@chickles @Lrihendry hmmm, how is my ignorance showing? Please share your intellect.....
@Lrihendry many of you guys are ignorant, much of you are HILLBILLIES and you've all been conned by DEAR LEADER
@missy_zaccaro @GOPChairwoman I don't know...seemed fairly easy going to me....for some reason conservative sees things the rest of us don't
@realannapaulina you're not stupid enough to think the wall would stop any of this business....what you're actually doing is praying off all the gullible people that do not know any better
@GOPChairwoman didn't think it backfired at all....Acosta once again showed us he's a great reporter
@KaitMarieox god, are you on your high horse or what
@Rurba002 no fake news
@simonamangiante all your tweets showing you guys together makes me think your relationship is extra special
@KaitMarieox listening to your simplistic crap is like licking nails....it's beyond stupid
@Lrihendry you're trying to tell me Trump had a shot to win California? are you on crack?
@KaitMarieox @SenFeinstein I have a question: have you ever thought about posing without a gun?
@Jim_Jordan no he needs to answer relevant questions about the investigation....
@KayaJones @chelseahandler no, a lot of us think this showdown is a distraction for Russia....and we've seen plenty of proof of collusion
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Except that Chuck and Nancy are right....Donald Trump wants to distract from the dysfunction of his cabinet by insisting on this stupid wall
@KayaJones @realDonaldTrump I just can't let this remark go without a response...anybody that sings, 'I got your t-shirt on but you can take it off,' is more of a dunce than a celebrity....and those are the people that support Trump
@SaraCarterDC @chuckschumer let's just legalize drugs in some fashion and this stupid war will be gone forever...
@mitchellvii why? that's what it is
@GOPChairwoman you're citing Grover Norquist, the most right wing lobbyist know to man as a source?????
@Stop_Trump20 Agreed....that's what he does....he's in a lot of trouble...unfortunately he does have the guts to screw up our institutions to obstruct justice
@KayaJones @GOP @PressSec she was called out by a fox interviewer for not reciting the facts
@KayaJones @chelseahandler hyperbole
@KayaJones @1stLiberty this is great....separation between church and state (and a relief to us sensible ones tired of seeing stupid religious symbols that mean nothing)
@SenatorCollins then why didn't you encourage the Merrick Garland hearing?
@KristySwansonXO @BreitbartNews I'll join them as well....let's impeach that motherf_cker
@KayaJones what's inaccurate about that?
@Burreh71 @nlkolikof @MrDane1982 to preface this I was a hilary supporter....with that said I guess it depends on your definition of 'rigged'....if you read Donna Brazile's book or listened to those interviews and believed them which I do , you'd conclude that Hilary had several unfair advantages
@KayaJones who are you? Each time I read one of your tweets, I feel like I'm in purgatory....people are talking at a level and as a response you make these dumb points, as if they have validity...
@KayaJones what?
@KayaJones not controversial....we actually care more that you argue over such stupid subjects and influence so many people in the process
@SteveScalise Rep. Scalise...did you watch the interview? She said 70% at 10mm, which hardly would target your constituency.....
@KayaJones would feel fine....funny thing is deep down don't think you give that much of a crap either
@MIKE42933927 @KingCujo @nlkolikof @MrDane1982 oh didn't look at the page....I see now
would be great to see him whoop Mcsally https://t.co/lJXz1hpkVq
@KingCujo @MIKE42933927 @nlkolikof @MrDane1982 are you guys serious?...I live in Quincy, MA, vote democrat, wanted Hilary to win...I'm not a Bernie lover. I wasn't trying to get into any type of argument. I was just calling it as I see it-I just don't think Bernie is a grifter... And oh yeah I cannot stand Tucker Carlson....
@KingCujo @nlkolikof @MrDane1982 ok I googled and not sure if I concur...his three homes combined are worth around 1.2 mm...to me that's modest for someone of his stature...he did share his 2014 tax return... maybe we should resent him for other reasons but don't see so much hypocrisy
@KingCujo @nlkolikof @MrDane1982 grifter? I'm confused. Thought Bernie was a few things but never that...
@nlkolikof @MrDane1982 of course it was rigged...it all came out after the campaign
@kevinkoverskaos saw that you an Aston Villa Supporter. Wanted to reach out to let you know that we have a supporters club that meets occasionally. Hope to hear from you. UTV.
@realSighBot @BankGrenier @KaitMarieox not the big guns she waves around?
@RepDavids @RepDebHaaland congrats...
@KaitMarieox wow your hair's big
@TheJordanRachel most people on the left don't believe but wow what a stupid point....they don't pay those taxes until after they wages...please learn the tax code 101 before you talk
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump again you're full of sh_t....what a f_ckin' surprise.
@mitchellvii hmm but the president needs to be impeached so what should we do?
@RepMarkMeadows they should be open to impeach the president....he has run a very corrupt cabinet
@DLoesch fantastic idea....let's hope it passes!!!!!!!!!
@mattgaetz yeah suppose that's accurate or at least I can speak for myself; I don't like you and I root for the other party....fingers crossed that voters will figure out what a fraud you are
@realDonaldTrump @cvpayne you're really smart, cool, legal and of course a hero
@SenatorCollins @SenAngusKing can't when he serves with the junior senator from Maine in 2020
@wins_karma @archmac21 @PressSec Archie, as an American you have my permission to keep talking....
@RepAdamSchiff good to hear
@KayaJones Kaya, what to you say to us people that don't believe in God? (or that the concept of God is not recognized when performing science)
@DLoesch so you're saying we have divine rights? please help me with this logic.
@SenGaryPeters good luck with that request
@KayaJones @realDonaldTrump @nytimes Kaya, US senators are not involved in allocating state tax dollars....please learn the roles of different elected officials before making such a silly statement
@JudgeJeanine thought she was funny and most important...SPOT ON!!!!!! Happy new years Judge.
@MittRomney put your money where your mouth...let's get started in getting rid of this doofus as a president by uniting your party
@alexanderbruz If Mitt Romney made his money as sleaze ball then the president made his money as douche bag....perhaps the dirtiest, skankiest businessman of our time
@JackPosobiec ok....the hopefully he'll have the guts to stand up to Trump, which will hopefully be a contribution to the end
@RobbyMook it will be more about the candidate than anything else...we need somebody who's talented...Maybe O'Rourke....Maybe Kamala
@DavidWohl and they were trying to breach a physical barrier....you snowflake
@tonyschwartz Whitaker and Mcconnell might stop major discoveries so we need to watch the proceedings carefully and LOUDLY protest anything that seems handled wrongly
@funder let's make sure he keeps his job...whitaker could block a lot of what he NEEDS to do for us to get transparency
@MattWhitaker46 you need to step down for the sake of this country
@IAmJamesStewart that was bad
@AriFleischer except that would be 2.5 billion dollars being wasted
@realDonaldTrump thanks for the reccomendation....more excited to read the Mueller report, which will be by far the best bio regarding the situation
@RudyGiuliani I think you're full of sh_t
@KaitMarieox don't think you'll ruin my new year but you day stupid, unproductive things and you're only seem to be here to get under people's skin
@KaitMarieox you're such a special person, advocating your support for the 2nd amendment while making guns look sexy...god bless america
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump what about all the crimes he's committed?
@DavidWohl @ChuckCallesto you're really making the original insult today, David
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump valid point...now Trump is pulling because of grade a assurance from Turkey
@KayaJones that is incorrect...do your research before posting bs for the masses to see
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump you're like no other troll in history...I am baffled by some of the bs you say including troops loving Trump, which I doubt is true
@RudyGiuliani give it a few more weeks....we all will see that the president is guilty and for your role it's highly likely you'll be disbarred
@GOP what the hell's your point? you think the wall will stop drugs from flowing into this country?
@SusanRo98824906 @mattgaetz so you're name's not Susan?
@SusanRo98824906 @mattgaetz Susan, I might be wrong but I think you're a troll...your tweets have very little substance and you misspell easy words all over the place like 'evasive'....I'll notify Twitter and they'll judge from there....
@SusanRo98824906 @mattgaetz don't do that there are grammatical mistakes and simple statements all over the place...again who are you and what do you do?
@SusanRo98824906 @mattgaetz I just told you...your writing is often distorted...you misspell a lot of easy words, you make comments that are so simple you seem to have an agenda to antagonize people with different politics than you and you seem to tweet in spurts. Just tell me where you live and what you do
@SusanRo98824906 @mattgaetz sort of, but your responses are sometimes random and you often skip over subjects and make such simple statement, that it seems important to establish your identity....where do you live? what do you do?
@SusanRo98824906 @mattgaetz Susan, again who are you? What do you do? Where do you live? an approximate location would be fine...
@SusanRo98824906 @mattgaetz Susan, I want to know who you are? Where do you live, what do you do?
@realDonaldTrump you're full of sh_t...what a surprise
@SusanRo98824906 @mattgaetz Susan, do you actually live in the FL panhandle? If so, where? What do you do for work? Just want to know whom I'm chatting with....
@SusanRo98824906 @mattgaetz Susan, you're not following the conversation...I'm accusing you of using news that you're taking from outlets you label as 'fake news' and using it to advance your argument....
@KatrinaPierson what the hell's your point....there's ton of politicians with f_ck loads of money that live it up everyday...
@AnnaHorford yes, though never thought about it but now you mentioned it I'll start doing it
@Taradisechic @sharimacm @realannapaulina @realDonaldTrump yes you're creating a diversion by listing their challenges and then suggesting that I don't sympathize with their situation, which makes your argument pretty week
@SusanRo98824906 @mattgaetz Susan, we hardly have manufacturing for a variety of reasons....one huge reason is that small businesses simply cannot compete against companies outsourcing goods/parts from foreign countries....regulations and high taxes pale in comparison to economies of scale
@SusanRo98824906 @mattgaetz yes, we agree on that....though the measurements is what makes your point silly
@SusanRo98824906 @mattgaetz Susan, you just referred to a story from a fairly liberal source: Yale University, which was reported by all of these outlets to make your point....now you're calling these outlets 'fake' to advance your agenda...you're contradicting yourself
@SusanRo98824906 @mattgaetz yeah it's probably the same study that I just refuted.-it was done using a regression model instead of literally counting the estimates, which the PEW poll does...if it's different than please post it
@sharimacm @realannapaulina hmmm? they sure as hell better be paying attention to overall attitude of the general public...an/d we sure as hell don't need Ms. Paulina uttering this divisive, confrontational crap
@realannapaulina thanks for your tough talk but doesn't the military work for us, The American people?....granted we're thankful for their service but they sure as hell better give 'sh_t' what we think
@SusanRo98824906 @mattgaetz you're citing a random Yale study as your evidence, which has not been corroborated by other studies....otherwise every other estimate has it between 9mm-11mm
@SusanRo98824906 @mattgaetz and here is another article from a more conservative publication confirming my number is much closer than yours https://t.co/MroRbSqekB
@SusanRo98824906 @mattgaetz Here is an article disputing your 22mm estimate https://t.co/Mr4IZ1FYmL
@SusanRo98824906 @mattgaetz No you can use all the exclamation points you want but we don't have that many illegals
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump that's wonderful...how about not make stupid military decisions so our allies and our interests are protected?
@SusanRo98824906 @mattgaetz it's not 22 mil, it's 9 mil, and hardly any of them just walked over the border....they're here on over-extended visas...again you've been conned by Gaetz and the president to think that the wall do anything
@SusanRo98824906 @mattgaetz Susan, you're wrong about homeowner rates...they're below average over the last 45 years. With regards to the economy, unemployment is low but wages have not increased....and oh yeah my taxes increase because itemized deductions are wiped out while businesses pay less
@SusanRo98824906 @mattgaetz Yes, when I say 'likening' I am acknowledging that... I suppose I have to spell out why it's a silly metaphor...the walls in my home aren't 2000 miles long, they don't cost $20+ billion, nor when they were built they didn't have to address the discussion of overstayed visas
@SusanRo98824906 @mattgaetz you likening walls in my home or a security system to the proposed wall? On what planet do you live on? indeed I do recommend you become educated on such subjects and you'll learn how ineffective the wall will be...actually watch Will Hurd, a rep. from Texas speak on the matter
@SusanRo98824906 @mattgaetz Susan, thanks for using 'the you don't know me' crap that I hear so commonly from conservatives...but back to the subject that you brought up however, simple solutions such as the wall or cutting taxes do not solve the issues that they try to solve
@TomiLahren Tomi, what f_ck are you talking about...they died in our custody
@DLoesch this doesn't seem like a tantrum to me....
@DavidWohl no, the doc had it right....your son has thinner skin than a blueberry
@KayaJones what if we told you that some of us don't believe in Jesus....
@TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump oh really and shut out several people from earning their checks in the process?
@KaitMarieox god you're a f_ckin' wierdo
@SenatorWicker no what you mean is you had lobbyists rewrite the tax code, making it more advantageous for rich people and punish people living in liberal places in the process
@KaitMarieox thanks for posting a video of you shooting a wooden wall with a 'Happy Holidays' sign on it...watching you shoot a gun is a great Christmas gift to us all
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump please tell me what the 'truth is?' No collusion?
@realDonaldTrump another Christmas with you...I think we have enough content to officially say you're a very bad president?
@realDonaldTrump you're full of sh_t....again
@realDonaldTrump no dumb_ss the market is falling because the whitehouse is a sh_tshow
@GeorgePapa19 @MollyJongFast you look really cool in those sunglasses....can tell that you're a real bad_ss
@realDonaldTrump @RT_Erdogan are you f_ckin' serious...you're taking the word of a goddamn dictator...
@GeorgePapa19 that you can't get enough funding for your campaign
@thehill yeah and as a side affect they'll wipe out the Kurds
@SusanRo98824906 @mattgaetz Believing in God is common sense? Again Matt's appealing to your senses instead of addressing the panhandle's concern...education, raising individual income, etc.
@SusanRo98824906 @mattgaetz Susan, this is the same crap coming from Gaetz's mouth... look at company's balance sheets...you'll see that they're hoarding more money than spending it...or drugs-with all those dumb laws we've got drugs are still coming in through the sea or smuggled through customs...
@realDonaldTrump dumb person...my stocks are going down, government workers are shut out from working, you're about to back stab the Kurds when they're the only people that like us in that region and you're saying these stupid general comments....just go home
@realDonaldTrump you got to go away from the white house...anywhere, one of your stupid skanky mansions, jail, anywhere....just go away!!!!
@joshscampbell president puss
@SusanRo98824906 @mattgaetz Susan, you're difficult to understand but It sounds like you're suggesting that education does not matter very much. That silly attitude is what gets you Matt Gaetz...instead of a leader that does not focus on the stupid cultural issues such as abortion, the wall or cuts taxes
@LucilleBurdge what a dbag...
@RudyGiuliani you're full of sh_t again
@JudgeJeanine @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @RepMattGaetz congrats on getting these 3 doofuses together...though after watching you for the last year I shouldn't expect anything less
@JonLemire what a f_ckin' surprise. Trumps listens to some dumb dictator instead of his military
@AynRandPaulRyan @realDonaldTrump I think the secret is how he moves his hands. They dictate the disussion. #ResignTrump
@realDonaldTrump all I can say is #TrumpResign
@DavidWohl and of course a 24/7 troll such as yourself would find this and post it
@senatemajldr @POTUS Just imagine if you guys did not get behind pres. trump in the 1st place...we wouldn't have these dumb talks.
@joncoopertweets this is good #TrumpResign
@TomiLahren Tomi. what the hell's your point...veteran amputee or not, investing money in a pointless wall before our veterans is stupid
@joncoopertweets agreed...why don't we just practice saying this a few times...
@LindseyGrahamSC are you nuts?????
@mkraju what a godd_m flake!!!! just get rid of her in 2020...
@PressSec great news...he'll once against demonstrate that the republican senators are certified p_ssies and cannot stand up for themselves
@realDonaldTrump when will you get the f_ck out of our lives???????????????
damn straight...want this dumb, irresponsible nightmare to end https://t.co/pR1stAIz61
@KatrinaPierson getting called dumb by you is like a doofus calling Michael Jordan a horrible basketball player
@jeffhebb @KayaJones I countered your evidence with better evidence and you come back with worn out name calling...good luck with that
@RebekahWorsham I get stupid insults like that all the time over Twitter....it goes with the territory...don't generalize a group of people over one stupid insult
@realDonaldTrump Jail is a much better place for you than the presidency
@RepMarkMeadows agreed let's fight against the stupid, pointless border war
@jeffhebb @KayaJones what the hell are you talking about? you provided two findings (a CBS poll which barely supports your point and a Harvard/Harris poll that doesn't support your point. I then gave you a Gallup backed report, disputing your silly argument that most Americans want a wall....
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump Oh I don't think most people will call it that.....espically when dear president shouted really loudly I'll shut down the government on national tv
@jeffhebb @KayaJones thanks for grouping us as all socialist and spineless. Insults like that bring us together....don't know where you got those polls.  Here's another article saying that American don't want the wall....	https://t.co/f59osDKUUL
@16softail @DavidWohl @christianllamar @realDonaldTrump putting up a wall is morally right? that seems like a very simple argument to make
@TomiLahren actually plenty of experts and studies that experts have cited have more or less confirmed that the wall is a stupid idea...
@KayaJones congrats...the wall will cost much more than that, many more people won't want it and we luckily have 49 dems that won't agree to that crap.
@SheriffClarke @KayaJones Sheriff Clarke, you sound like a real bad_ss that we're supposed to celebrate for his toughness and independence....(wonder what would happen when you're actually in a room with a rampant shooter)
@KayaJones wonder what will happen to you when you finally learn there is no jesus
@KayaJones @FLOTUS thanks for sharing another bit of pointless info
@DavidWohl I care
@marcorubio Good, looks like you came around Marco....now let's see if you actually do something
@SenDuckworth I'm sure he'll speak to the public...please don't put too much pressure on him because he seems to actually be a good guy
@marcorubio Senator Rubio, you know it wasn't so why do you even utter that?
@KatrinaPierson Katrina, I wonder where you'll be in three years after all of Donald Trump's crimes are exposed ....guessing you'll be a regular consultant to Fox news, having distanced yourself from the past as much as possible...
@KatrinaPierson what a weird tweet...cannot tell if this is a warped joke or what...
@DavidWohl I agree. Don't know if I shedded a tear but it sucks that Whitaker can participate in this investigation when he's clearly against it.
@realDonaldTrump just would like to thank you for making America pathetic for the first time ever
@GeorgePapa19 so happy for you...it's so great you share your love with twitter
@LindseyGrahamSC Lindsey, thank you for your passion...wish you had half of that passion when fighting against this trump movement because now there's a mess to clean up
@JackPosobiec and Republicans nominated Roy Moore..let that sink in
@RudyGiuliani you gotta point...that was a pretty f_cked up little arrangement congress had and we should know every suit that was settled...just like the president should not have paid those women to hide that info from us
@RepMarkMeadows @freedomcaucus that's nice to hear...why don't you fight something worse fighting for such as the president evacuating troops from Syria?
@Bornabrit1 there might be a couple of more doofuses: that Corsi guy, Pence,anybody on that transition team will be looked at...think Don Jr. will come afterwards...remember they already have a crime on Don Jr. so there's no point to indict him until they conclude the investigation
@TomiLahren @Comey @foxnation Comey has never been our martyr...again you speak untruths
@simonamangiante @GeorgePapa19 wonder how long she'll be by your side....
@eop61 @CRPolitical @HughLander1 @SaraCarterDC Ratio's skewed because many more people on twitter are more popular than me....if you wish to follow me, be my guest....Please look at my tweets during this back and forth. They all have been supportive of Mueller and critical of tweets calling this investigation 'witch hunt.'
@JRubinBlogger that's a relief when reading all this conspiracy crap on twitter makes me think the world has been turned upside down
@eop61 @CRPolitical @HughLander1 @SaraCarterDC If you're wondering if I'm a troll I can guarantee you I'm an honest guy, living in a blue collar town south of Boston....otherwise who the hell cares?
@SarahPalinUSA for some reason I think this is a fairly meaningless post in the grand scheme of things...
@RepKinzinger wish I saw these posts in the 1st two years of trump's rein.
@GuyDAmato @HughLander1 @eop61 @SaraCarterDC I can put my hand up and say I'm real
@CRPolitical @HughLander1 @eop61 @SaraCarterDC again you're calling him a crook without evidence, which make this a made up argument....
@CRPolitical @HughLander1 @eop61 @SaraCarterDC seen no evidence that Mueller is crooked only occasional utterances with no evidence from the president and a few other people so entering a debate on this is silly
@jeffnord2 @CRPolitical @HughLander1 @eop61 @SaraCarterDC Again I don't know any other response other than Flynn got caught committing a crime. Evidence is crystal clear and he's having his day in court.
@gporter0071 @SebGorka that's probably not true but who cares...just want to see the big boy's crimes exposed
@jeffnord2 @CRPolitical @HughLander1 @eop61 @SaraCarterDC don't know what to say to that....he was caught red handed lying to the FBI and did not register as a foreign agent, which was not pursued but the judge mentioned yesterday....with regards to your army point, bad people come in all shapes and colors, army people included.
@CRPolitical @HughLander1 @eop61 @SaraCarterDC do you know something I don't know? the agreement was redacted. we don't know what he's shared with Mueller...
@LindseyGrahamSC more importantly Russia's not defeated
@eop61 @SaraCarterDC no, he's guilty. He plead this so it's decided on. It's why we have a judicial system to settle issues of contention.
@mitchellvii transcripts are nothing for republicans to be proud of...
@NoCowpieZone @SaraCarterDC who cares about 'liberal lackies'? It's the court system that I care about and it looks like a lot of people are guilty.
@SaraCarterDC Sara, Mike Flynn admitted to a crime in federal court. He's a big boy. He had agency.
@SebGorka agreed...great to see Pelosi taking over so real action against this corrupt president will be taken
@realDonaldTrump don't what all democrats have said....I've said I don't want to build any wall, see through or not because it's a stupid idea
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump he actually has called for a border wall and we think it's a stupid idea
@realDonaldTrump you have the reputation of embellishing.... and lying
@DavidWohl everybody that disagrees with you is incompetent....that is the essence of your tweets
@realDonaldTrump going to bid two bucks for that portrait of you your charity owns...
@maggieNYT we all know that Judge Jeanine is a seasoned lawyer
@MollyJongFast sounds accurate
@realDonaldTrump and where did you get that number? from your friends in Moscow?
@realDonaldTrump you'e guilty
@DavidWohl @PressSec talk about acting like a 5 year old
@TomiLahren of course you're so modest, you post a preview of your segment for us to see how special Major Golsteyn is
@DavidWohl I guess he's working....
@Amy_Siskind guess that's a milestone...I'm still all about McSally losing in 2020, which I think she will because she's fairly reclusive
@cnnbrk oh Martha, you don't have a shot in 2020...
@DavidWohl not only do you tweet crap all day...now you want to be a thug
@thehill @HillTVLive Gaetz is right...I will be pushing the dems to impeach Trump....
@realDonaldTrump that's very admirable....just imagine if farms goods could be sold abroad without tariffs.
@mercedeskat45 he probably should be arrested
@GeorgePapa19 now you're badmouthing Joseph Mifsud? If I got it right, you met your wife through him and because of him you're going to get some dumb contract from Fox to spout your bullsh_t
@KatrinaPierson Katrina, I'm wondering what's going to happen to you after Trump resigns or gets kicked out....
@RudyGiuliani you're lying...again...this makes you despicable
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews if he did he's wrong...there is proof of collusion and tons of proof that you lied to us
@realDonaldTrump you do babble...
@KaitMarieox @The_PCPolice you sort of look like Ms. Butina
@realDonaldTrump don't worry they found the path to you...they're just organizing everything right now so we understand everything clearly
@krassenstein cannot say it better
@KaitMarieox @pewdiepie wow another provocative picture of you holding a gun. how lucky we are to see this
@KaitMarieox Kaitlin, thanks for over-simplifying and then incorporating another political issue in your statement...
@BrianTRobb doesn't look like their night...getting outsmuscled, no concentration, rushing layups,etc
@RudyGiuliani this is a lie and obstruction of justice
@DavidWohl I would agree but this is a BS story from a source that is known to be full of sh_t
@wardog6actual @KaitMarieox thanks for the correction...suppose that makes it touch less symbolic
@RudyGiuliani haven't seen you lately on CNN....why don't you utter these lies while being interviewed by a real interviewer
@KaitMarieox Kaitlin Bennett, you're such a symbol of liberation with that machine gun.
@krassenstein hmmm...it's funny...all of these are similar to my analyses of the president as well
@GeorgePapa19 are you nuts? you're running? where? you're the clown of politics right now...
@chuckwoolery @BreitbartNews I care what he thinks..he's a very smart man
@realDonaldTrump another guy you'll kick in the ass on the way out....
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump that's not true. I'm not applauding president trump for his handling of the korean conflict. I think he's done a bad job actually.
@CJSKeane @AynRandPaulRyan yes in 2020
@AynRandPaulRyan I'd very much welcome Mcsally...she'll get her a_s handed to her in 2020...
@realDonaldTrump can't wait to see it....you always deliver on your promises
@DonaldJTrumpJr @GOP great....got my eye on other issues regarding you and your father
@dale_callihan McConell is missing....those are just posers...McConell has done damage that will take a couple of decades to correct
@TomiLahren you really were born to troll....I just wonder if you'll ever produce anything worthwhile?
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Other than the fact that we have bushels upon bushels in storage because of the stupid trade war initiated by our president
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump no he's actually a very reliable lawyer, who will provide facts, not what the GOP or the DNC wants to see
@America20864111 @DavidWohl I don't know...he doesn't always seems to believe in the integrity of the judicial system
@GOPChairwoman and just as many drugs will squeak through with or without the stupid wall....
@realDonaldTrump you ate his soul, you motherf_cker and now you're spewing bullsh_t
@DavidWohl I'm sure this is bs like most of the things you post
@SusanRo98824906 @mattgaetz Susan, people obviously have a broader outlook and more skepticism on policy when they're more well read and therefore make a smarter decision on who to vote for...Matt Gaetz unfortunately says things that distrustful people  agree with
@AriFleischer after what we've learned the last several months, this seems fairly appropriate
@SusanRo98824906 @mattgaetz Smart majority????? no, it's because he lives in one of the most vulnerable, one of the least educated places in America, where voters have no concept how he hurts them
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump a lot of us want them to be 'weak' on border security....
@KayaJones @realDonaldTrump what are you saying? Are you saying 'the witch hunt' prevented him from having a full cabinet? I'm wondering if you'd ever thought about blaming his management skills?
@seanhannity good luck with that one
@kayleighmcenany you're right he'd have a hard winning a backwards state like Texas....when it comes to the more normal states, he most certainly can win
@SethAbramson Is it? I just can't connect many dots to Trump with her...perhaps there are dots to connect and maybe smarter team understand this
@mysticrose29 @krassenstein what do you mean 'source?' no sh_t he's worried...
@DavidWohl David, I called out your son for making a stupid comment and he blocked me (and probably several other people). I'll admit that you have thick skin. Your son....not so much.
@newtgingrich remember Newt, there's corroborating evidence....
@TomiLahren https://t.co/Gd2Z4iRTZX  thanks for referring to an outdated method of measuring poverty....
@Sir_RazzyRay @TomiLahren other than NM and I guess AZ now, that seems fairly republican run
@TomiLahren Tomi, wish there were penalties to utter that type of crap over twitter....
@BulldogLoyalty @jgra555 @RepAdamSchiff then you're living under a rock....
@HWMAuthor @Eck43 @baseballhall not with you regarding Baines
@luchadora41 @RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump affiliating Schiff with Allison Mack...that's low
@BulldogLoyalty @jgra555 @RepAdamSchiff think he has plenty...plenty has come out already
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump no doubt about it...thank you Obama for leaving us with a great setup even when a buffoon took office
@BruinsBergy @CoryAllan3 @NHLPlayerSafety I'm a WHALERS fan....I watch the Bruins more than any other team. I like both players involved in the incident.
@CoryAllan3 @BruinsBergy @NHLPlayerSafety agreed, hit was clean, just a LITTLE late...I could see 1 game but not 2...if it was me I would have fined Hyman
@NHLPlayerSafety seems a little harsh...maybe a game or stiff fine but this guy has always been an honest player
@mattgaetz how the hell did you become a congressman? (and I know it's because you are from the Panhandle, where you can more easily con people)
@TheJordanRachel what a baseless, stupid statement....ps 'the deep state' is la la land rhetoric
@RWPUSA don't know if he knows more than us...we all think Trump is guilty even if the evidence hasn't come out
@GeorgePapa19 you are irrelevant
@DavidWohl @AdamSchiff I disagree...think he's a great congressman
@B52Malmet maybe Romney will see the light and lead them to a new place....otherwise there's no one here
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, we're passed James Comey...right now the emphasis is on Flynn, Cohen and Manafort and what they've divulged
@BreitbartNews agreed, let's impeach Trump. He's a criminal.
@Hoopi_79 @NoneSince67 @3rdPeriodSuits live in Boston, Edwards as usual exaggerated the hit...was blindside, was late. Hyman might get a game for that but the refs got it right.
@BShareCohen not nearly as bad as I thought it was at first...though it was blindside...maybe a game
@EdKrassen for sure I'm with you
@TC41582449 @SRuhle that's where we disagree. I prefer to hear about sweet p_ssy.
@james_shea @HackswithHaggs I agree, thought Kadri held his own
@PattyMurray @ELLEmagazine couldn't care less about your gender. Just fight for us and stop the chaotic ideas coming from the other party.
@RepMarkMeadows who the f_ck cares??? the focus is on Trump and the crap he pulled with Russia...
@JohnnyTheTMan @DavidWohl @SecretService maybe...though right now I'm personally focused on countering all the crap he says, as he probably influences many impressionable people
@DavidWohl @SecretService doubt the secret service gives flying f_ck
@MichaelAvenatti @GeraldoRivera there's no argument...he was aware of it
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump I doubt that
@realDonaldTrump actually I'd argue that there was definitely collusion and I'd a million dollars you knew about it
@realDonaldTrump @GeraldoRivera no, let the investigation continue
@GeraldoRivera is she really? Experience as a news anchor qualifies her?
@GeraldoRivera @POTUS and what planet are you living on???!!!!!!! Everything indicates a crime committed by our president.
@RudyGiuliani Rudy, am I in dumba_sville? Your client was just implicated in a felony from the SDNY....and Mueller's two reports for Cohen and Manafort were heavily redacted because the investigation is not finished and probably implicates the people Cohen and Manfort worked for
@HPorter1966 @DavidWohl @BerryTessie @realDonaldTrump @GeraldoRivera hmmm....everything he's done looks legitimate to me...
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump @GeraldoRivera everything's seems legitimate to me...maybe you can come up with some backup to make your argument more convincing?
@KayaJones @realDonaldTrump Kaya, please let us know your stance after the reports that came out yesterday
@ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump with all due respect let's be realistic...
@seanhannity who cares what, with her bubbly personality she's going to be a thorn in your side for 40 years
@AnnaHorford mean person. I certainly don't want you to do that.
@GeorgePapa19 I would shut up if I were you
@DavidWohl why does he need help? that seems accurate
@funder he's nailed too
@missmayn No McConnell's probably fine
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, you're nailed.....
@realDonaldTrump I agree...Rex Tillerson is a perfect example of the dumb a_ses that you chose to fill your cabinet
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump hopefully he wouldn't be so dumb as that would be obstructing justice
@EdKrassen perhaps...can't wait to read these 87 pages
@realDonaldTrump another person without the needed experience
@EdKrassen don't know if I agree...she has to do better by us than she has when negotiating
@alexspeier @Ken_Rosenthal 4 years 67.5 million for what is essentially a journeyman pitcher that has had two tommy johns....I want to think this deal is ok but it just seems bad
@DavidWohl in what world are you living?!!!!
@DavidWohl @MichaelAvenatti @JacobAWohl no, a lot of us are actually pissed at your son for spreading false crap into the world
@realDonaldTrump but you're forgetting one important thing....you're still a creepy conman
@EdKrassen we already knew that....
@DLoesch Agree with Brian, you don't really want him to have a merry Christmas...you're trying to get under his skin and that of many others by acting unemotional, instead of getting engaged and making yourself susceptible to criticism.
@DavidWohl it actually seems accurate to me
@realDonaldTrump oh what a surprise, you're full of sh_t
@missmayn the president is totally f_cked
@DavidWohl David, there is a serious crime that was probably committed. This is very serious. As a lawyer, you should respect this process and not smear the person running it.
@PoeticJ59274248 @marcorubio until after he appears on Meet The Press
@RepMattGaetz @seanhannity @FoxNews with all do respect your talk is thuggery...hopefully you'll taper soon
@realDonaldTrump Before you tweet again, just want you to know that I'm anxiously waiting for the Mueller report to see if this is the beginning of the end for you
@DavidWohl for some reason I just don't think most polls show this...
@jp_jeannie @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump not exactly...there have been a few indictments on the way
@TomFitton that would obstruction of justice...let's not see this happen
@realDonaldTrump and I think you're guilty
@EricTrump @KellyannePolls I disagree...your father is participating in witness tampering. That's a crime. Hopefully we have not lost our mind and your dad will be held accountable.
@logicrules2 @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump ok have a good night
@logicrules2 @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Of course Assange will lie...there is overwhelming evidence that Russia hacked the election so arguing this would be silly....Corsi and Stone knew that Assange, a foreign national was releasing emails to persuade american voters to vote for trump, which is illegal
@logicrules2 @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump I disagree...the wikileaks is a crime...emails are enough evidence for some type of conviction...if the Clinton are guilty of the crimes you list of course they need to be convicted. At the moment that seems like a conspiracy theory.
@logicrules2 @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump just looked at a few articles relating to this story. The report has not been substantiated....Of course that would not change the email correspondence btw Corsi and Stone, which probably is enough to prove conspiracy and certainly enough to prove aiding + abetting
@logicrules2 @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump ok, provide some news about emails to China, always have an open mind....unfortunately we differ on Flynn, Corsi and Stone...Flynn obviously plead guilty, from what I see Corsi and Stone knew about the wiki-leak dump, which is clearly a crime
@logicrules2 @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump hmmm....never heard the Emails going to China theory...I'll keep my ears open....in the meantime Mueller and seem to be following the right leads since quite a bit of criminality has been exposed, which we should all be thankful for
@logicrules2 @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump clinton campaign emails
@RepMattGaetz @FoxNewsInsider another example of displaying your self-importance
@RealCandaceO I hope you two keep on with this cat fight...two silly divas who think they got intelligent things to say scratching at each other
@AmyMcGrathKY why not take a shot of bourbon before cutting down the Christmas tree?
@TomiLahren I look forward to not reading it
@DLoesch answer the question
@RepMattGaetz Matt Gaetz, you're full of sh_t once again. What a f_ckin' surprise.
@realDonaldTrump I disagree...I think he's running a good investigation
@TParkPrincess @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump I'm confused....you're saying that the investigation is only confirming what the suspects have been saying all along?...if so I'm watching a different investigation.
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump no, the real collusion scandal is whether the trump campaign conspired with Russia to get damning emails....Mueller and his team have it right
@stucam7771 no I doubt it...
@RudyGiuliani wondering when they'll remove you from the bar with all the crap you utter
@TheJordanRachel is that really true? in how many instances has bad guy with a gun been killed by a good guy with a gun? Probably 2-3% of the time
@TheJordanRachel what the f_ck are you talking about? you guys are constantly denying Trump's involvement with Russia....you guys are as full of sh_t as much as anyone
@robbystarbuck maybe not but this isn't just a president...this president's compromised. Let's not kid ourselves
@Ocasio2018 agreed, stupid wall...
@realDonaldTrump  hey Mr. President, since we all basically now know that you're guilty, can you at least tell us where the prostitutes peed on you?
@TheGoodGodAbove @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews God bless you God
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews I'm watching....it's full of sh_t....like you
@seanhannity oh really...I sort of think has just been reporting this info and isn't trying to get anything
@DonaldJTrumpJr are you nuts??? you're about to get indicted for conspiracy and you're tweeting????
@PoliticalShort @NPR @nprpolitics are you lost in the world?
@JordanSchachtel on what planet do you live on?
@SenateGOP @senorrinhatch @SenBillCassidy why don't you stop this vain crap and comment on the mueller investigation?
@DavidWohl David, they got the goods!!! your man is cooked....wake up and smell what's on your feet...
@StormyDaniels I'm thankful to you.
@RudyGiuliani Rudy, you're full of sh_t. Please represent your client quietly.
@funder Donald Trump Jr. has a little bit more to worry about....
@DavidWohl you mean 0 chance that there was fraud...your party lost those seats.
@matthewamiller great that these tremendous powers of influence are getting along
@JudgeJeanine @foxandfriends how the hell you became a household name is beyond me?
@DavidWohl except you sold your dignity to get him in
@realDonaldTrump no it looks like what you did is not legal....hence the investigation.
@missmiafaith unbelievable
@CheriJacobus @highbrow_nobrow he's certainly going to have his chance
@SenJoniErnst @realDonaldTrump couldn't agree more....maybe we should focus on some of his past meetings with Putin....or the likely scenario that he had an understanding with Putin....and the total fact that you republicans have done nothing to protect us from his recklessness
@Jim_Jordan how about admit that you've been one of trump's little minions
@KayaJones Kaya, are you not paying attention to the details??? This was hidden from the campaign, there was a plan to give Putin 50 billion dollar apartment and oh yeah he's complicit with Russia....
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump no he's doing his job and you're just a megatroll
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump don't you think we should discuss the events of today?
@DLoesch don't know what you literally sound like....I do wish you stayed quiet
@KayaJones are you f_cking me with me...she was investigated...twice!!!!!
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump @StephenMoore @JacobAWohl is that something to be proud of?
@seanhannity what would you expect?
@missmayn agreed...sick of him being pushed over
@SenatorBurr ok, what your opinion about the president in that matter?
@PressSec that's good....I'm a little bit more interested in hearing about Deutche Bank. Do you have any news about that?
@EdKrassen and Trump's base is still more stubborn than ever
@realDonaldTrump um uh, I think you're saying something that's not true
@senatemajldr You really are the biggest piece of garbage there is...instead of agreeing to put out a bi-partisan warning about Russian attacking out infrastructure you vetoed it....only so you could gain more power...
@realDonaldTrump May you please comment on the direct allegations?
@DavidWohl David, why are you mocking him? Mueller just issued a report that seems very telling
@funder well I want him impeached...he lied to the American people
@DavidWohl hmmm...did you read the latest report? seems pretty clear that Cohen was lying.
@realDonaldTrump it actually has looked more credible as it has continued
@realDonaldTrump you're a beast....a wannabe dictating beast...
@Nicoxw1 that sounds accurate
@VivianM61425009 no you're making that up...again an excuse for a president that almost assuredly guilty
@TomiLahren instead of the mockery, I'd focus on the president and his lying
@Amy_Siskind wasn't for this but the dems have spoke and now it's time to focus on Trump and his thuggery
@chuckwoolery are you insane????? Coal hardly exists anymore? Try natural gas or hydroelectric plants, which is of course much more environmentally friendly than petro...though I'm sure you might exercise an opinion about that also
@TomiLahren no, that's called generalizing
@Rugure89 @gatewaypundit what????? I don't think so. Only reason why he's being attacked is because the president and his supporters are scared.....
@Lesterh82 @gatewaypundit no, he was authorized by one of the president's confirmations
@gatewaypundit I really wish it was illegal for people like you who defame people of integrity like Robert Mueller. Mueller isn't dirty and is running an airtight investigation but you are attacking him simply because you want the president protected.
@senatemajldr you just blocked the protection of the Mueller investigation and you're bitching about other things!!!!!
@AynRandPaulRyan of course none of us are surprised...we've seen story play out several times before....though we need to keep on trying to get this state in a better direction
@senatemajldr the biggest priority is the possible collusion between the president and russia....please get to the bottom of this
@realDonaldTrump I see what you're doing...by being very angry and showing disdain, you're trying to CON us into believing your innocent
@GovMikeHuckabee instead of pointing out the 'hypocrisy'  why don't we actually focus on Manafort's lies?
@realDonaldTrump It's time for you to comment on the collusion that's been revealed....
@senatemajldr what a surprise...you're not commenting on the emails proving that there was COLLUSION
@realDonaldTrump they got emails between Corsi and Stone, saying when emails will be 'dumped'
@RieneRichard @jimbo77767 @JackPosobiec you're getting slightly personal with your remarks. (I might too if the person I looked up to had a whore piss on him)
@brianbeutler @danpfeiffer I'd be fine with that too...(just get Ms. Fraud out of our lives)
@danpfeiffer I look forward to seeing it....
@patsajak @RealJamesWoods @FLOTUS I just don't see it...she seems a little ditsy compared to other first ladies who had intellect and sass
@RieneRichard @jimbo77767 @JackPosobiec fair point. Never gotten magic piss on me and I've missed out on the experience....though I do have some bragging rights in that I've never done something so weird as having a whore piss on me.
@RieneRichard @jimbo77767 @JackPosobiec Puff the Magic Dragon? Hmmm, don't like that as much as 'Donald, the MAGIC PISS inhaler?'
@JackPosobiec I see your trick but trying to make this sound unrealistic, you're trying to convince it's not possible but indeed it seems very possible for them to meet and us not to know about it
@englemanmike1 @JackPosobiec no, no that's for the religious doofuses to believe in....
@JackPosobiec I believe in the pee tape as well...a lot of other things seem fairly credible from that report
@MikeReiss good to hear though the amount of penalties is not what concerned me about Hochuli's crew-it was the lack of consistency
@RealCandaceO did you read the quote? Did she ever say that this situation is the same as events she listed?
@TomiLahren you're babbling again
@TomiLahren thanks for the quiz...wonder how you'd do on a pop quiz on ethics?
@TatianaKnott4 @GeorgePapa19 ??????
@GeorgePapa19 George, I am so confused why you keep on talking. You agreed to a punishment, which in affect dumbed down your relevance. You're just confusing us with these silly tweets, which is not fair when we want to know the truth.
@DavidWohl And you didn't read the comment with any aptitude....
@SenatorCollins Senator Collins, after your Kavanaugh debacle, your word has been severely discounted...instead of following your voters' wishes, you'll fall in line with the conservative establishment so why don't you stop trying to sound independent?
@KayaJones @realDonaldTrump hmmm, I think countries think he's an idiot
@RepMattGaetz @Jim_Jordan good idea, though you're forgetting one important thing; Jim Jordan's a certified dumb a_s
@DavidWohl no that's not what he was saying....he saying Mueller is investigating him and then he will go after your son........
@funder wish I could agree....think we need new blood that can be tough with Trump. Don't think she's up for the job.
@papa8891 @DavidWohl @VictorCrawford1 seriously he busted Trump's campaign manager for embezzling millions upon millions of dollars
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump wow, listening to you all day would be like being in purgatory...
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump can't wait to hear the next piece of stupidity that comes from your mouth
@SenatorCollins I'll be thankful for people from your great state when they vote you out
@GeorgePapa19 @joshscampbell isn't Mifsud the reason why you met your lovely wife?
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo How does that have anything to do with anything??? not only are you making up and excuse for Saudi Arabia-you're saying something that has NOTHING to do with Saudi Arabia
@funder don't know about that...think we might be sorry if she gets the top post. The speaker needs to be a fighter that is respected by Americans whether they vote dem or rep,
@maxexaminer @kimguilfoyle ????
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews we're in 'Dear Leader' land
@DavidWohl @MichaelAvenatti Mr. Wohl, it seems like you have wishful thinking that Avenatti hit a woman, which is fairly f_cked up
@SenBobCorker your actions have done nothing but enable the president so whatever you say is in one ear out the other
@DLoesch Dana, don't think saying something viscous gets us anywhere though IMO you won't compromise your view for a couple of reasons; you want to be looked as tough and you get more money uttering this conservative crap, which I think is shallow
@DLoesch I'll help contribute to the dumb range as I know none of my money is going to a such stupid sterile cause and remind you there are people getting gunned down all over the place because of you and your constituents f_cked upped stubbornness.
@DavidWohl @jaketapper thanks for posting such a credible source 'Breitbart News' to make your point
@simonamangiante with George going to jail, will you give up your false notion of self importance and perhaps go away for a few days?
@KayaJones what the f_ck are you saying!!!!!????? listening to you is like purgatory-you throw out such a ridiculous comment I cannot think where to begin to argue
@MichaelAvenatti he's also a bit of a narcissistic puss....I told him one of his tweets was stupid and he blocked me....probably has blocked anybody that disputes his BS
@realDonaldTrump what a clever play on words 'Adam Schitt'....you really are the masters of one liners
@DavidWohl right now the FBI is challenging the credibility of those reports and the person that released those reports (your son) I'd shut up if I were you
@MichaelAvenatti Mike, can you tell us what's going on?
@DavidWohl @LADAOffice Mr. Wohl, your internet tough guy look is getting tiresome....why don't you take a day off twitter?
@LouMerloni Eovaldi...3/45? think he's going to get more years/ more money per year than that
@realDonaldTrump for some reason I don't believe you...quite excited to see the Mueller report
@krassenstein let's see the allegations....
@DLoesch I agree, let's just get rid of all those guns...
@DLoesch What a wonderful IDEA!!!!
@realDonaldTrump I'm only thinking about the congressional hearings where we can hear more about your dealings with Russia. Can't wait for your constant tantrums over #AdamSchiff....
@LindseyGrahamSC that's great news...will you continue to throw disgusting tantrums during confirmation processes...
@DavidWohl @JacobAWohl @MichaelAvenatti David, from all reports it looks like the story's bogus....might not be but looks that way...I'd shut up before we know more info
@Amy_Siskind @sethmoulton @TimRyan Amy, as a democrat, what's wrong with the dems figuring this out? There are many people that don't want Pelosi as speaker....Tim Ryan is also a superstar in the democrat party, wouldn't advocate smearing him
@DLoesch actually Trump lashes out at a lot of media figures and does not control himself when a critical question is asked....he is that THIN skinned
@DLoesch better than the Trump show....or any of those stupid gun shows
@DavidWohl @MichaelAvenatti not sure what you're doing is legal...threatening Avenatti physically over twitter. It might be better for all of us to tone that stuff down.
@nytimes that's great....now let's figure out what to do with Whitaker
@kimguilfoyle without Flake or Collins, your votes will not pass....
@KatrinaPierson Katrina, you work in goddamn white house and you're using your time mocking liberals on twitter....
@Jim_Jordan @nytimes I'm so glad you have no authority anymore....
@realDonaldTrump and you're full of crap....what a fuc_in' surprise!!!
@DavidWohl David, you know your mockery only infuriates people and that seems to be what you want
@DavidWohl @CNN no you're making another thing up....again
@krassenstein hate to say it but Mccarthy is a Trump guy too...almost as bad, just not as dumb. Trump controls those minions in rep. congress
@SenJoniErnst look forward to you getting ousted in 2020
@RealCandaceO @CNN and what planet do you live on?
@TomiLahren good point...let's not have the bible ever involved with politics
@PamKeithFL please don't forget Susan Collins, that partisan hack is up
@marcorubio Marco, you might be right but you are clearly partisan and should not be talking
@ravidravidravid golf courses=eminent domain
@RealCandaceO @Acosta @AprilDRyan @CNN what does that make Fox News?
@DavidWohl @brianstelter @BoutrousTed David, you only say partisan things so your words have no credibility
@JeffFlake @kyrstensinema yeah look forward to an Arizona senator that doesn't wilt under pressure
@KayaJones why the mockery? some of us just don't like Trump....
@JebBush fine....in the same breath please say that there was no election fraud and everyone should shut up
@lauferlaw @kyrstensinema congrats senator sinema....
@HashtagGriswold why can't you believe it? he's a grade a sh_tf_ck....
@TomiLahren you utter the most partisan, silly tweets I've ever heard....you love attention, good or bad
@DavidWohl David, what do you think of Trump and the allegations against him?
@GovMikeHuckabee Governor, please do not opine about this in public. Let Florida figure this out without any outside bias.
@realDonaldTrump no, politicians should not comment on the process and of course that includes conmen wannabe dictators
@KatTimpf with all due respect Kat, although it's wrong to yell at people when they're out in public, it's time for Fox News to understand the damage it's doing...it's not just about being 'a difference in opinion.' Fox News is propagandist and we're frustrated by its selfishness
@realDonaldTrump hey wannabe dictator, please shut up and let the election board do its job
@PolitiBunny that's a stupid, ideological way of looking at it....somebody in South Dakota literally has 9 times more influence over the judicial system than I do...
@DavidWohl @brianstelter @PressSec @Acosta @PrisonPlanet I like Jim Acosta...thinks he a good reporter and report the facts
@MacMcKinseyIV observant person
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump huhhn, I get the idea they think he's an idiot
@SarahPalinUSA god I wish you would shut up...for starters you're irrelevant these days but more importantly Florida seems to be organized in making sure that the recount is fair
@TomiLahren Tomi, thanks for the mockery when you should be encouraging a fair election that abides by the rules, which Florida seems to be doing
@brithume you're right, just wish you could lead followers into not believing this nonsense
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump are you f_cking with us....you support Donald Trump!!!! thanks for the hypocrisy
@DavidJollyFL @mattgaetz @adamsmithtimes don't know what to do with this guy...he just utters constant crap.
@mattgaetz oh really you're now involved in this you loud mouth propagandist....when history reflects on you, you'll be remembered as among the most irrelevant loud mouths just shoveled sh_t in our ears every time he spoke...
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump @SenJoniErnst @ChuckGrassley @TerryBranstad who the hell are you????? Whitaker is under investigation, openly admitted his scorn for the investigation and oh yeah Trump is under investigation and you're telling us this is whining? Could the president take a crap on your dog and you'd blame liberals?
@marcorubio again you need to shut up...you talking is not fair to us
@TomiLahren Tomi, with all due respect you're among the most combative people on twitter...
@marcorubio you might be right but you shouldn't be saying anything right now....you have a civic obligation to SHUT UP!!!!!
@marcorubio and I'm asking you to shut up and let the votes be counted....please
@JackPosobiec shut up about 'the steal' let's count the goddamn votes
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump how 'bout the Trump administration....that seems fairly corrupt
@RealCandaceO @FLGovScott no he did not win it (yet)....all votes haven't been counted
@realDonaldTrump I'm more interested in talking about you....you conned us into electing you, you conned your dumba_s republican senators and house reps to cover up for you and now you want to con us into allowing you to have total rule over us....mr. wannabe dictator
@realDonaldTrump in the meantime you hired someone to solidify your total rule. Wannabe dictator Don....
@realDonaldTrump save for the Floridians that didn't vote for Rick Scott...they're even the possibility that the majority didn't vote for Rick Scott
@realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA let's count the votes first
@RepMarkMeadows I am so relieved that you won't have control over the Russiagate deliberations....
@realDonaldTrump wow you're a real a-hole, especially he delivered your vote for justice Kavanaugh....hopefully your base will figure this out before you f_cked them up the ass also
@TomiLahren are you listening to yourself 'maybe it is God and prayer that's missing'
@marcorubio perhaps you're right but you're the wrong person to be talking....otherwise this looks very partisan. in other words please shut uppppppppppppppppp!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@marcorubio Marco, you got to stop tweeting about the election...you're using your platform to cause chaos, which is selfish
@JeffreyGuterman would counting all the votes make him less mad?
@RudyGiuliani I'm a fool....let's count every ball (and partisans like you should be quiet)
@parscale no they are counting the votes...
@DaveBencko @AndrewPollackFL every vote should be counted (no matter who administers it)
@marcorubio you said it every vote should be counted (and you should say nothing more)
@DaveBencko @AndrewPollackFL the only complaint is if there is phantom vote counting...there is no evidence. Gov. Scott needs to shut up
@NatasjaYonce no that's not the truth...votes have actually been counted fairly...please do not make things up
@AndrewPollackFL Mr. Pollack, I think you're full of sh_t....there is proof that Brenda Snipes is doing anything illegal...please let her do her job
@marcorubio Mr. Senator, you being a little bit of a drama queen...why don't you relax and let the voting board do what they do?
@marcorubio Marco, you made your point. Now it's time to shut up....
@GOPChairwoman seems like a clean election to me....hopefully you or Mr. Rubio can stand on the sidelines like the rest of us and let this professional do her job
@LindseyGrahamSC though you discounted the 'majesty' with your screwed up actions during his confirmation
@marcorubio apples and oranges
@GeorgePapa19 you sound like a man of conviction (how could you ever be a criminal?)
@GeoffWBaron @GeorgePapa19 for one thing I argued that Mr. Papa led the FBI to criminals Russian or American, which he did.... I suppose 'collusion' or conspiracy hasn't yet been proved though ALL these crimes involve Russia (or pro-Russian entities), making this investigation a success
@DavidWohl hmmm....that sounds heavy handed.....are you sure this is a rational statement
@GeoffWBaron @GeorgePapa19 you're being too technical...all these crimes have to do with Russia
@marcorubio good, sounds like a fair election.
@GeoffWBaron @GeorgePapa19 Are you joking?  Manafort, Flynn, Gates, Papadopoulos, probably Stone, the 12 Russian GRU officers, Alex Van der Zwaan, Richard Pinedo, all ultimately related to Russia....probably Stone, Cohen also and oh yeah probably Trump
@simonamangiante again you can go away and the attacks will decline...otherwise please stop complaining
@GeorgePapa19 you got drunk and said enticing things...they investigated and found criminal things...and still finding criminal things.....
@DavidWohl I care...he is a hero, especially when he has to deal with the strong arm thuggish tactics of our president and of course deal with the ridiculous supporting statement by the president's groupies (ie: you)
@KayaJones what the hell's your point. He still had a gun and killed lots of people with it.
@RealJamesWoods this is unbelievable...you doofuses are actually running with this when no fair minded person believes Acosta did anything wrong
@mikiebarb @PressSec @Acosta Jim Acosta, you are our hero. Please maintain your professionalism
@RIch1281 @RedNationRising that's assault???? and you're a snowflake!!!!!!
@RedNationRising where's the assault? snowflake!!!!!
@tribelaw thought it was a blatant massacre...
@SebGorka really for some reason I don't get that impression
@ally_axiom @JackPosobiec I'm confused because Acosta did nothing wrong
@TomiLahren tomi, we've seen this happen over and over again for the last 25 years....and you 'can't believe'???
@PressSec that's f_cked up....he didn't do anything. We all saw it.
@SenatorCollins like you'll do anything....you let us all down with Judge Kavanaugh
@realDonaldTrump for some reason I'm thinking you fired Sessions because you want to protect yourself....
@MsMollyRachael but I'm happy we have the house. I'm hopeful our new stars can have a positive approach and counter our presidents divide and conquer approach.
@MsMollyRachael on a philosophical standpoint we actually didn't get the red state cities to vote as much as they needed to
@MsMollyRachael it takes longer than a tweet to sum things up but devil is in the details....some horrible gerrymandering will continue, trump will continue to get those awful judges confirmed. We have the house but we didn't get as much as we should've. We need to tighten our approach.
@cryborg that would be nice
@800money @MichaelAvenatti @sharicedavids don't know if I would describe her as tough as nails but I like her...to win against the divide and conquer type strategy ie Trump or W, you need a superstar, which might be Beto, Tim Ryan, Eric Swalwall, Kamala, Booker, Etc.
@800money @MichaelAvenatti @sharicedavids don't know if Harris is what is needed for the dems
@MsMollyRachael wish I could share your optimism but it wasn't a good night for us...we needed to do better than that....
@Jim_Jordan you've conned them once again...congrats
@realDonaldTrump first thing is first you'll give them your tax returns
@Vermeullarmine is it called for her?
@MichaelAvenatti you might be right....we need a superstar unfortunately... Beto's the closest we got to being Barak or Bill Clinton
@SoporificANES @TrumpsShroom @MichaelAvenatti we need to do better than last night....Beto certainly had the thick skin, he untapped voters but we mis-guaged how vulnerable Ted Cruz was and because of it he's around for 6 more years.
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump I guess I'll pick 'obstruct, resist, hate and destroy!!' it's better than deluding ourselves such as the comment above
@kimguilfoyle @DonaldJTrumpJr I hope not...hopefully voters can vote to begin to end this hell that's been hovering over us
@KayaJones @strathclyder @MrJackofAllTra3 @buttholegranola @realDonaldTrump this is ridiculous...Kaya, you know you're not in the same league...you're creating a false battle just to get attention...
@GeorgePapa19 thanks for the words of wisdom but what if want to know the truth about the Russian investigation?
@theblakex @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump Funny....though there's been very little proof of voter fraud
@KayaJones @realDonaldTrump I agree; the more voters the less republicans
@TomiLahren Wow an old tactic. Belitting someone by contrasting him to a noble profession
@simonamangiante I'm intrigued....are yo sure George's family left him penniless because he seems to be living large at the moment
@simonamangiante Simona, you're a little less important than you might think....I do not see anything about you or your husband on CNN or MSNBC....though if you want to endure less personal attacks, you can stay out of the public eye for a little while
@KayaJones @realDonaldTrump Kaya's most certainly right...that's why you need to vote democrat
@DavidWohl @FoxNews great reporter, tells it as it is!!!!
@mattgaetz @realDonaldTrump wish Pensacola better representation....
@KatrinaPierson @CNN @donlemon @marclamonthill @LouisFarrakhan not bad points...though they pale in comparison to the recent doofuses who have probably felt compelled to kill people because of the culture brought on by your boss
@illzemcarthur @simonamangiante @dbongino nahhh, think I can handle your mighty intellectual horsepower
@illzemcarthur @simonamangiante @dbongino Oh I doubt that
@RealJamesWoods thanks for the pictures...I actually want those people in congress and think that your people are beyond corrupt
@TomiLahren love the name personal mockery, Tomi....can I partake? Uh..,,,you're a ditz?
@illzemcarthur @simonamangiante @dbongino two can play this; Bongino is a thin skinned, tantrum throwing, conspiracy uttering, wannabe bullying thug....
@illzemcarthur @simonamangiante @dbongino ??????
@MacMcKinseyIV last thing I'd want is lose Scott Baio as a customer
@MorriseyWV good...coal should be a thing of the past and west virginia should continue to find other ways to generate revenue
@JessieJaneDuff bs....in a country of over 300 mm that some lies would circulate is a non story....it still does not change the serious allegations filed against him and that Dr. Ford was very credible
@tedcruz for some reason I think you're lying...what a f_ckin' surprise
@tedcruz yeah thanks for your work on nominating the most partisan justices possible and speaking up when one of the fairest justices known to man; Merrick Garland wasn't allowed a hearing
@tedcruz texas, please do us a favor and spare us this doofus
@simonamangiante @dbongino Dan Bogino might the biggest th_g there is in political commentary...congrats on joining the realm of political puppets
@RealKyleMorris just because one allegation is false doesn't vindicate Kavanaugh, especially when none of have heard of this allegation
@aleciavaught75 @TomiLahren with all due respect Alecia, us liberals make a lot more money, have had much more education and still believe in higher taxes, which will pay for programs that are mostly used by republican voters who don't know what's good for them.
@TransplAngeleno @BillPlaschke though both teams were not as good as the AL teams, especially the AL teams this year
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump actually I would say liberals acknowledge facts, where people such as yourself advance BS such as the Mueller rape allegations
@KristySwansonXO you're babbling
https://t.co/sS3qp1Yz4q. texans please get the vote. You play a key part in keeping up our democracy.
@RealCandaceO just learned about you...if you actually led Black people to have an independent voice I'd commend you but it seems like you're embracing a movement that will leave more black people isolated...for your own selfish motives. Fingers crossed your pov won't last.
@TomiLahren I'm enjoying watching you two argue....it shows that you two are so ambitious and selfish that you'll step over each other instead of saying rational things....please continue
@simonamangiante I've never made fun of you for that....I've critisized you for making yourself relevant when in reality your opinions have no relevance
@GeorgePapa19 you're done...we're paying attention to other people
@DavidWohl not really...he's reciting the constitution
@realDonaldTrump already been out: the market's tanking.....
@benshapiro Ben, with all do respect this seems like part of celebrity life...seeing that you're fairly thick skinned, I think you'll be able to ignore it
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/v1chCexgqu		what you said is not true...@AmyMcGrathKY is not loyal to Nancy Pelosi
@PamKeithFL @realDonaldTrump @RonDeSantisFL beautiful observation
@KayaJones Don't you support the president? Just don't think this comment has any meaning coming from your handle...and it won;t until you critisize your party
@NickGiva @john_harpa @kmeagle @MichaelAvenatti @ChuckGrassley still want to know who the hell your wife it
@Cassidy_79 @TomiLahren Most of the hostile remarks that I've seen on this tweet makes fun of her speech/immaturity/overly simple remarks, which of course might be veiled sexism though we can't tell.
@BillShaikin Red Sox fan here...Hill is now one of my favorite players
@DavidWohl 150 billion dollars? Where did you come up with this number? Please provide a source and us skeptical people can fact check this
@ChrisJZullo don't know if I care...I want Joe to show better leadership skills and help his people understand what is in their self interest
@realDonaldTrump praying's a nice (pointless0 gesture...coming up with gun control you'd actually be doing something
@nota_snowflake7 @DavidWohl @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump I'm a real person if that's what you're getting at? Live outside Boston, make a modest income, have a small chi-mix,dog, etc. Whether you're accusing me of making succinct comments to counter simple politics left on ignorant people, guilty as charged.
@realDonaldTrump @jaketapper hmmm....why does he comes off as crazed? He wants to impeach you. Remember a lot of us want to impeach also.
@GeorgePapa19 @TuckerCarlson why don't you go on a real show and get asked real questions
@vincent_goetz @DavidWohl @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump sure, Trump has advocated for policies that clearly affect ethnic groups across the country...of course there are arguments that he's putting 'america first' but as a side affect he's empowering racism/anti-semitic acts or just plain nationalistic acts....
@DavidWohl @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump thanks for listing alll of the reasons why President Trump should not be anti-semite.. Nevertheless his rhetoric incites plenty of doofuses to kill us: ie:: Charlottesville and now Pittsburgh
@SenatorCollins then do something senator collins...fight for values and not for your party
@GovMikeHuckabee shut up about Satan please....let's stick to Earth please
@marcthiessen @SteveScalise Marc,, the question is whether their politicians' rhetoric encourages violence or at least hints at the idea of violence....nobody would argue that Trump's rhetoric has empowered people to do serious harm to others; whereas in general Bernie's supporters are peaceful
@BrittMcHenry @Boilermaker720 @Jen_Royle Britt, with all do respect Fox has a reputation of hiring conservative blonds then dumping them when they get a younger one to take their place. We'll see where you are in three years...
@DavidWohl If Donald Trump took a dump on your shoes, would you say it was for the common good of the people?
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump we're different in that belief. Humans are as evil as any other being. Maybe this comment is only political. regardless I have no confidence that Trump will start being a unifier
@SebGorka @realDonaldTrump @SteveScalise @tedcruz @SarahHuckabee sort of said you were irrelevant by now....wondering who actually listens to you,
@realDonaldTrump oh yeah it should be said that you genuinely do not care about your constituency.....
@realDonaldTrump they're right your rhetoric isn't presidential. it further divides us. It might help you, as you have conned a bunch of ignoramuses to vote but it f_cks up what we've all built.
@realDonaldTrump @BrucePoliquin mr. doofus, Jared Golden has actually been an advocate for gun rights and also is a military guy
@NickGiva @john_harpa @kmeagle @MichaelAvenatti @ChuckGrassley still don't know who the hell your wife is....
@NickGiva @john_harpa @kmeagle @MichaelAvenatti @ChuckGrassley seriously who is she? if she made that much money (at least 10mm) she'd have minor celebrity status
@TomiLahren fingers crossed one day you will be irrelevent and we'll listen to commentators that can help our politics become civil
@KayaJones @realDonaldTrump perhaps they mentioned his rhetoric was insightful (which it is), which played a major a part in the bombings though they never blamed him for doing it
@RealDennisWill @katebunton @KayaJones @kathygriffin doubt he actually does.....remember all the lies he's already told about his finances...
@KayaJones @realDonaldTrump thanks for the mockery. that really helps us come to common ground and makes me happy to share a nation with you...
@DavidWohl anything that propels your agenda, you say it
@KayaJones @DannyTarkanian @Vegasgungirl @kimguilfoyle @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump hoping you're wrong, think you're wrong....
@TomiLahren to know that your voice is relevant to so many people shows the state of our country....
@DavidWohl what the f_ck are you talking about????
@The_Longhorn @JacobAWohl yeah, he can't take an insult, doubt you can either
@The_Longhorn @JacobAWohl seems like I cannot comment any more on Mr. Wohl's handle, looks like he can dish out all the dirt he wants but cannot take it when someone gets a little dirty with him
@JacobAWohl Another dumb ass piece of trolling...
@JFNYC1 @MichaelAvenatti I agree; he's going to kick ass and piss all you people off....and I'll be quite happy in the process so win for everyone (or for people that actually matter)
@JacobAWohl young ignoramus....wish I didn't have to respond to this crap but you got a huge following and unfortunately influence almost 200k people
@JacobAWohl thiis  has got to be the most misinformed tweet and what is sad is that there are 28 doofuses that agree with this crap
@simonamangiante @GeorgePapa19 it's so great to see your indisputable love for one another.
@TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump thanks for the false equivalency and helping to confuse people on what is otherwise a simple issue: a journalist was killed in consulate, most likely administered by the ruler of Saudi Arabia
@kenolin1 that is surreal
@SenatorCollins thanks for your commentary....I'm sure you'll do a lot to remedy this and make sure it does not blow over
@GregABedard gotta be joking
@KaitMarieox interesting, your whole platform seems to point out 'liberal' insults and promoting guns...it's as if I can predict every twitter post before you write anything
@KaitMarieox that's fine though making weapons look sexy is screwed up
@TomiLahren more interested in her pregnancy than listening to you speaking about issues that you don't understand
@Mrspickls @old_osc @GManfan64 @HarleyRouda it's getting cleaned up
@realDonaldTrump for some reason I just don't see things the way you do
@SenatorCollins says the 'I'm a moderate but votes with conservative senators on issues that actually matter' senator...your word is as credible as Porky Pig
@DavidWohl he voted to repeal healthcare, he voted for the reckless tax cuts so doofuses like you could hoard your money and he voted for Kavanaugh....what else do you want from the guy?
@realDonaldTrump cannot wait when this Trump hell is over and blossoms will bloom again
@realDonaldTrump what would he do? say 'I did kill the journalist to consolidate control of my country?'
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump what the f_ck is coming out of your mouth....all signs point to Saudi Arabia and you're just uttering bullsh_t to compliment your politics
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews except for the Americans that didn't want him in office; though you think this is 0 sum game
@DavidWohl can't wait for hispanics to be the majority in Los Angeles so you can relocate to Bakersfield
@simonamangiante @GeorgePapa19 it is great to see how much you two love each other before our very eyes....
@EWErickson what the f_ck are you talking about? We're interest to see whether representatives of a government killed a journalist.
@JackPosobiec and he might've been an unarmed person killed in a consulate
@KCinFLA1 @JacobAWohl Really? thought I pointed out a very simple point by a very privileged person...last I looked we don't live in a vacuum....
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump wow, of course you're making excuses when the evidence is in plain sight....we've gone to doofusland
@JacobAWohl what a stupid observation: if true it means they're making an unacceptable amount of money
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump actually last I looked he didn't win the majority vote
@krassenstein unfortunately Des Moines is a fairly liberal city....need to get western Iowa to get a little more liberal
@ryanstruyk @CNN O'Rourke/Bloomberg are the only guys from there that can win...need to have someone that bulletproof against Trump's bullcrap.....
@JacobAWohl you gotta be f_ckin' with me....if he was killed by the Saudi's in an Instanbul consulate that would be a big deal
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump we have a deal and now it's done and they most certainly can start building because of the dumb decisions of our president (and only our president)
@KayaJones thank you for the historical lesson though you forgot all the coat hangers stuck up vaginas to remove babies....
@CharlesPPierce agreed...get him the hell out....he doesn't represent my approach, which we've learned is twice as important as politics
@SenSchumer you continue to get f_cked over by your daddy Mconnell. Grow a f_uckin' spine for once.
@SenSchumer Are you f_uckin' nuts!!!! You agreed to put these goddamn judges through the confirmation process so you can go campaign!!! Absolutely batty!!!!!
@MichaelAvenatti @VanityFair @emilyjanefox If the dems don't get more of a backbone we might have to settle for it....otherwise gop will walk all over us
@JudgeJeanine poor f_ckin' dogggg!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@Jim_Jordan good hopefully he won't show you anything....want to know why? because you're f_ckin' biased!!!!
@jasoninthehouse I'm sure you're full of crap
@GeorgePapa19 I'm more concerned about the Russian collusion probe
@GlobeChadFinn good call by Cora....he was slowing down, losing command
@SenatorDurbin  Senator Durbin, I greatly admire your work but I wish you stood up to Lindsay Graham when he berated our party in the senate...It's time to confront the party head on
@KamalaHarris  senator Harris, As someone that admires your work, I wish you had stood up to Lindsay Graham when he made that awful speech during the Kavanaugh hearing.
@LindseyGrahamSC @nikkihaley after your Kavanaugh tantrum don't know whether you're sincere or just full of sh_t
@KellyannePolls No we looked at those too...he's f_uckin' conservative, which a lot of us don't want on our highest court.....
@DavidWohl don't blame him...this news suck for all of us....even you
@MichaelAvenatti hopefully the dems will realize that we need you as much as anyone, as we need someone that won't allow other people to brand them.
@LindseyGrahamSC I see you know how to unite the country
@GovMikeHuckabee @united @Delta that's very interesting
@GovMikeHuckabee in the throws of nomination process where the nominee was accused of sexual assault you make a stupid comment....
@DavidWohl What the f_ck are you talking about????
@TomiLahren what a clever play on words....
@SenatorHeitkamp you showed some guts today
@JeffFlake Please protect the sensibilities of all Americans, denounce the FBI investigation as a sham and vote 'no'
@senorrinhatch @guypbenson though 50% of Americans don't think he should be confirmed....
@SenatorCollins I see you continue to avoid discussing Kavanaugh over Twitter
@DavidWohl I'm not one of them. I matter too....
@DavidWohl I saw the play on words that was a funny joke....
@seanhannity an inaccurate poll
@newtgingrich @facebook two words; Merrick Garland
@KatrinaPierson please stop making this historical argument..the Republican party is far different party now then it was then
@charliekirk11 you're advancing your argument by showing a person's hysteria, which is shallow way of making your point.
@StevenW79997830 @DavidWohl @MichaelAvenatti no don't think so. not her garage sale. She came to Boston earlier this month to do her usual performance...nor has Avenatti taken money from her either. Talk about 'fake news'
@StevenW79997830 @DavidWohl @MichaelAvenatti oh really, please post the picture of her doing a yard sale.
@StevenW79997830 @DavidWohl @MichaelAvenatti if he's 'an ambulance chaser' he's a very successful 'ambulance chaser.' Would probably take him more seriously than Mr. Wohl.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. Conman president...remember you advising the republicans to 'delay,delay, delay' the Merrick Garland vote
@DavidWohl How's that misleading. It actually seems to describe the situation with ms. Keyser very well
@LindseyGrahamSC you didn't show that much respect for anybody yesterday
@LindseyGrahamSC luckily we have sensible senators that can agree to give this due process
@JacobAWohl no, Dianne Feinstein is having a conversation with him. That is all.
@TomiLahren 'innocent Kavanuagh' and you think we just came out under a rock
@DLoesch Kavanaugh cited a conspiracy theory
@AnnCoulter 'that ludicrous creature from Hawaii' and what f_ckin' planet are you from?
@mega2e a harsh comment to take
@ECMcLaughlin @JeffFlake they're doing a vote. Doubt that Flake is going to vote 'no,' now.
@senorrinhatch you guys showed no effort to get to the facts with judge Kavanaugh....please don't point fingers at anybody else. I saw this with my own two eyes
@MollyJongFast @kylegriffin1 yeah there seems to be some evidence
@LindseyGrahamSC @foxandfriends so you can spit more anger and overlook the fact that this nominee is a complete ass?
jeff flake please have a goddamn backbone for once and vote no on this angry, entitled nominee
@KellyannePolls @LindseyGrahamSC Lindsay Graham 'fair minded'? what next, elephants will start crapping in toilets?
@charliekirk11 @LindseyGrahamSC no he was loud and dumb and did nothing to help get to the truth
@MichaelMcG6959 @seanhannity you might be right...who knows about 2020 but Graham showed a display of anger that had nothing to do with getting to the truth
@DavidWohl wow you continue to be a grade a ahole.....
@DougJones good to hear
@EWErickson Dianne Feinstein did not leak this....we do not know who did....please speak the truth
@joe_johnson1073 @SenToddYoung maybe...get your senator to say this
@SenToddYoung so you're saying that Dr. Ford was lying
@EricTrump @LindseyGrahamSC really....completely evading the hearing process and going on some rant about Kavanaugh's victimization was incredible?
@LindseyGrahamSC this was a very disgusting moment. I wouldn't be flaunting it
@DavidWohl even the republican senators show some sensitivity to Dr. Ford being a human being, you however, taking the smallest comments and exaggerating their significance makes me think you're the most selfishly motivated right wing troll on twitter....congratulations
@DLoesch what a dumb comment....as we know the FBI didn't even unravel these allegations...now that the allegations are unraveled, the FBI could probe them
@seanhannity And Lindsay Graham just showed the most disgusting theatrical performance when we actually want to figure out what happened
@ChuckGrassley that was a disgusting display about the FBI when of course an FBI investigation would better help understand what happened
@DavidWohl actually it was a display of irresponsible grandstanding when we want to figure out who's credible and who's not
@DavidWohl except a lot of people thinks she's credible
@DavidWohl where the f_ck do you come up with this logic?
@DavidWohl you know nothing so why don't you shut up and see what's going on instead of acting partisan?
@LindseyGrahamSC Lindsey, are you saying that people that defend porn stars are bad....that's pretty low.
@JacobAWohl when the hell did they ever defend MS13?
@LindseyGrahamSC Lindsay, please shut up and let this play out...you're adding nothing to the discussion with your dumb ass comments
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump you might be right....though you seem to say 'sham' to everything
@realDonaldTrump also he's not a third rate lawyer...not like you're a third rate businessman
@realDonaldTrump sorry but this is the type of people your whole degrading rhetoric attracts...good luck fending him off though if you do another certified a-hole will take his place
@Carring123 @EWErickson See a witness that might/might not be credible. See a judge that might/might not have done this stuff. Want to get to the bottom of it like any average American.
@Carring123 @EWErickson I have no idea and knowing that you are in a similar position as I am, you don't either. I'd like some type of investigation to see if there's evidence.
@Carring123 @EWErickson she'll show up...one of them will be lying under oath
@DeepStateShu think you're right....doubt Trump is going to fire anyone to their face
@EWErickson no I think there's plenty of steam... let's see what he has to say tomorrow.
@WorcesterHerald what happened to him?
@AlbanMurtishi whatever happened to him? used to work for one our companies.
@realDonaldTrump that's sort of, kind of, completely your opinion
@EWErickson don't worry he'll open it again so doofuses like you can resume trolling him
@SenJoniErnst god I hope Iowans get their senses and vote you out in a couple of years
@KatrinaPierson fairness? after Garland was ridiculously shunned and then the Dems sucked up Gorsuch, you're now saying that the Dems are being  unfair?...you sound a little privileged
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump you're full of crap....as always.
@SenatorCollins I know we've asked you this question a million times already...what will you do if he is?
@realDonaldTrump @marthamaccallum @FoxNews think we are treating him fairly if we investigate these allegations instead of just voting on his nomination
@benjaminwittes @nytmike @adamgoldmanNYT think you're probably right. They're just doing their jobs.
@KatrinaPierson what goddamn planet do you people live on?
@tedcruz why? the prohibition doesn't seem to be doing so well
@SethAbramson I don't know....Cruz keeps on reciting this god bullsh_t....he wants to galvanize conservatives. The crowd is also very partisan unfortunately,
@realDonaldTrump wow you're trying to piss us liberals off by saying something controversial. What a surprise.
@DavidWohl I don't trust you. I want to see what the investigation will say-hopefully we'll have one
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump oh really under which rock are you living?
@brithume no but many people have called her an idiot
@DavidWohl for some reason I think you're being partisan.
@SenAlexander you're full of crap
@KayaJones wish the DNC didn't block you, as it's one less outlet to utter your dumbass religious crap but rest assured you can make your stupid crap heard on my handle, as it amuses me quite a bit
@funder got to make sure texan Beto supporters go out to vote
@LindseyGrahamSC call it what you will...still want to know the truth
@simonamangiante thanks for the lesson
@gehrig38 sure her front hole has a little more integrity than your business acumen
@GeorgePapa19 with all due respect you're irrelevant in the grand scheme of things
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews good luck with that
@KatrinaPierson I haven't abandoned her....
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump well there might be the russian thing too
@DavidWohl hey doofus, we don't know anything yet. Please shut your trap before we here the stories....
@DavidWohl what the hell do you know about them?
@TomiLahren shut up Tomi....you're the last person that should be opining on a serious topic
@CLewandowski_ I'm not sure you're right.....
@KayaJones unfortunately I think she does have some belief of the imaginary guy in the sky....
@HarryForCT @realDonaldTrump spare me the economic argument that you know nothing about...let's focus on trump being utterly insane...
@KayaJones @realDonaldTrump Donald Trump has nothing to do with this....
@realDonaldTrump no, only the financing provided by all those oligarchs....
@ananavarro was just thinking it's because he sucks as a person (and a lot of us simply see this)
@AmoneyResists accurate list
@HackswithHaggs sort of bummed...trading a beloved defenseman for a 4th and 7th. not exactly how I wanted to see such an honest, selfless player go.
@GeorgePapa19 don't know what you're talking about but I'm sure you're making another dumb comment to impress people close to Trump #wannabe
@KayaJones although I am a proponent of the 1st amendment I might be convinced that there be a stupid tax on stupid comments broadcasted over social media....(and an equal tax for the more than 6000 idiots that 'like' stupid comments)
@JacobAWohl and he was an idiot so who cares?
@ShannonLeaKO @Mayo_kid700 @WiIIUnited @realDonaldTrump are you paying attention to all the corrupt people that have left in disgrace?
@realDonaldTrump hmmm, what a surprise. You again claim anything negative written against you is fake.
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews and you don't understand the concept of being conned...
@FoxNews @dbongino dan bongino, if you're such a stand up guy why do you block all of us?...it's one thing to talk to Fox News. It's another to talk to us people that think you run your mouth
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump don't think I'd generalize it that Mrs. Sanders
@SenAlexander I really wish you had some type of backbone...even this jurist does not align with your ideology
@PressSec we actually have one big reason to oppose Judge Kavanaugh; he's a right wing nut job
@gregborbonus @GOPChairwoman you're making an ideological argument (pardon the phrasing)....do you think leaking a few emails compromises the integrity of congress? (now we know that Booker's weren't officially leaked)
@gregborbonus @GOPChairwoman we disagree...to me Grassley was abusing his power (not protecting us) because he wants to insure a confirmation. That abuse of power is egregious enough for democratic senators to justify sharing the emails with us.
@crazytrain6701 @GOPChairwoman certainly won't believe the whole investigation is bs....we're way passed that....if FBI is involved in some conspiracy, they need to be held accountable
@gregborbonus @GOPChairwoman you can read the emails and decide for yourself...I don't think their too personal. Think Grassley withheld it because he thought it would cause controversy, which in my mind is wrong.
@crazytrain6701 @GOPChairwoman this information was purposely blocked to protect the nominee, not to protect security, which makes this a corrupt action
@PressSec can you tweet me your phone # so I can critique your press conferences?
@GOPChairwoman do Red State republicans think it's ok to keep important information that is not security sensitive from the American republic
@JacobAWohl you are the king of saying baseless comments
@JacobAWohl really, should we take this as threat?
@T0NIMARIETERRY @SenSchumer sad thing is their constituency couldn't care less how they vote on this stupid judge....they're just too jaded and selfish to figure this out.
@SenSchumer if only you showed fight when Merrick Garland was being f_cked over ....whatever you say it's in one ear out the other. Hoping that the Dems have a f_ckin' spine and vote you out as their leader. Time for a change.
@EWErickson no, it is 2/3 of the senate, 1/2 of the house....
@nikgaz98 yeah they got some roto setup so they got some type of box...
@nikgaz98 yes definitely. Unfortunately we have not found a bar that will play the AVTV games (hook up one of our phones to their tvs) but when it's on Skysports we meet up at the Rising Bar.
@senorrinhatch thanks for messing up again on behalf of the American people
@Jen_Royle yeah that guy is the biggest sob on and off the field in the history of the nfl...not sure if 'love' is the right word for me
@JacobAWohl you can keep on mocking us...but let's see what happens in a couple of years and see if he usurps control and makes this place a maddening place to live
@JacobAWohl no, we thought Trump would abuse power and ruin all the depts. that we rely on to make America great ie state dept. epa, dept of ed. and he has done just that
@lauramahler @DesignO9 @Spencer4Texas @MichaelAvenatti @BetoORourke @texasdemocrats @TexasYDs wish I could agree because Beto is great and has run a great, positive campaign....Avenatti exploits Trump's cowardice better than anyone...
@MaryRWilliams4 @Farnsulie @Danceindadugout @leeleeb50 @DBd6120 @GOP a charismatic democrat could pull it off...ie Jon Tester, Beto O'Rourke
@LibMatt22 @SenSchumer we need to get rid of Schumer and get a leader with a backbone...these times call for it
@realDonaldTrump oh really, like you'd do any goddamn thing with Russia in the picture
@JeffFlake ok so put your money where your mouth is and vote 'no' on Kavanaugh's nomination....
@RepAdamSchiff of course they will continue to look the other way....there number one concern is to retain power
@realDonaldTrump when mueller puts forth collusion evidence that's irrefutable, will that look good for your presidency?
@krassenstein cautiously optimistic
@TomiLahren no, we're fighting something very serious and you're too naive to figure it out
@DavidWohl except it wasn't doctored...and the salacious things are probably true too
@GovMikeHuckabee from creationism to labeling CNN to fake news...just wish you'd go away. You've done a terrible job leading your constituency.
@realDonaldTrump please tell me why you love Canada....
@KatrinaPierson @realDonaldTrump @POTUS you mean NONE of us will recover from that; especially the people he conned when voting for him
@TheJordanRachel why? she meant it.
@Education4Libs @prayingmedic what the f_ck are you talking about?
@foxandfriends @dbongino Dan Bongino, got nothing to say about the bullsh_t you're saying at the moment....just that you're a p_ssy for blocking everybody that disagrees with you and living in your fox news bubble
@JacobAWohl stop with this dumbass deep state crap....
@GeraldoRivera you can interpret this as you'd like....I know I'm making the same amount of money as I was under Obama
@Lovesunmoonstar @JacobAWohl oh gee I'd say the same thing about you....
@Education4Libs @prayingmedic A Quanon person is your godsend? And what planet are you on?
@SenSchumer why did you cut that deal expediting hearings for judges nominated by TRUMP???? We your constituency do not want you to do this!!!!
@realDonaldTrump I just want you to answer questions about all the looming issues....couldn't care less about the Don McGahn issue, though I do think your parting of ways with him was f_cked
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson but you most like colluded with Russia, which is even scarier....
@Education4Libs fact checking you after you say ignorant things time and again is getting tiresome but here's another internet source that is not known to have a liberal bias that touches on the issue....https://t.co/rbBxRtFqPD
@Education4Libs thanks for the lesson mr. liberal? I can't wait for you to preach all lives matter.
@PineappleTrevor @JacobAWohl no he likes to piss people off
@Education4Libs @realTylerZed for some reason I doubt this book will make the library of congress
@RealJamesWoods wow you seem kind of angry....hopefully you can take a few deep breaths, maybe drink some water afterward? That might calm you down so you get along with everybody.
@DonaldJTrumpJr and I'm very excited to see you flip on your father....
@JacobAWohl what the are you talking about?...that was settlement money. We all knew about it. You keep on spinning these untruths to us. Please do your research.  Start with this article.  		 https://t.co/t1G1Ar7U7b
@Suckitasshat @EdKrassen @Education4Libs you're probably right with most of these people.. just thinking some right leaning people would second guess educating liberal's crap if there are comments that confidently refute him.
@Suckitasshat @EdKrassen @Education4Libs it's important that we do that because he unfortunately has a huge following and further entrenches a lot of people in their beliefs
@metadar1 @EdKrassen @Education4Libs what a stupid comment....public records were released by SDNY so news outlets don't need to be referenced
@EdKrassen @Education4Libs thanks Ed, it seems that this is not resonating with many (if not all) Trump supporters...it would be better if they acknowledged that it was a felony, as it's right in front of our eyes and say they don't care instead of trying to make excuses....
@Education4Libs you're barking up the wrong wall.... Obama's campaign violated minor rules whereas Trump COVERED up the payment to Daniels by PAYING Cohen through his company, which is campaign fraud and tax evasion. These are FELONIES.
@realDonaldTrump and it's all because of you, dear master
@l_lengyel @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump you're full of crap.... Soros did not collaborate with Nazis. He went along with his guardian to take inventory of Jews that got extradited to camps. Never seen him say he's proud of this. Further he got rich as an owner of a hedge fund that traded in mostly currency....
@Education4Libs congrats on sharing statistics that are once again are wrong, especially the asinine 71% of simple drug possessions you cited, which on the face is ridiculous. Here's one study you can look at https://t.co/EZ34CyzFID
@Education4Libs and some of us don't believe in God....including the doofus that said that
@PreetBharara I don't know if anyone said this but Preet, if you could take the time to share your insight with us that would be great
@itsJeffTiedrich it might just happen
@Education4Libs he had no choice, he had to do it. It likes coming across evidence to something and giving it to the police. What should he have done? Throw it away?
@Lovesunmoonstar @madmamma4 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump wow, think you might have some anger issues. Maybe you need to take a few breaths and compose yourself a little before you tweet?
@Lovesunmoonstar @JacobAWohl thanks for the insult....at 14 you're not fully formed and he did mention he did not understand his predicament.  With that said Mr. Wohl is grasping at straws saying that he should be 'shipped back to germany' because he's not guilty of murder and actually helped Jews escape.
@RickLangel @TimothyStuckey6 @DLoesch sure, NRA has a lot of power over politicians, which has in effect prevented more sensible gun laws from passing.
@RickLangel @TimothyStuckey6 @DLoesch Timothy, as much as I hate the NRA and think the members are selfish, calling them these names is ridiculous.
@madmamma4 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump he played along to evade detection. He did not out people and actually eventually helped fellow Jews....the happiness he mentioned has nothing to do with the demise of his fellow Jews. He felt happy/exhilarated because of the weirdness around him.  Oh and he was 14!
@IDream_inColor9 @madmamma4 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump I'll do the walk away when bears stops sh_tting in the woods
@DLoesch I don't condone this message but we're rather frustrated with you
@realDonaldTrump @WashTimes wow they convinced me that all the accomplishments you claim are Obama's.
@madmamma4 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump it's unfortunate you're making a political point regarding a time when Jews went through desperate measures to protect themselves and their families....Nevertheless Soros did eventually quit that job but not before informing several jews of the nazis plans to send them to camps.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump you keep on tweeting. if I were you I'd lay low and prepare for your upcoming arrest this week.
@lhochsteinmd @Education4Libs we'll see....Trump is implicated in one crime. We'll see how much tolerance the senate republicans have.
@Education4Libs you are wrong as usual; 6 billion dollars wasn't misplaced-the PAPERWORK was unorganized, Obama gave 400mm as part of the nuclear deal with Iran and Trump paid a porn star secretly to influence the election, which is of course illegal.
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump George Soros is JEWISH and was only 14. You're a piece of work.
@GOP I haven't gotten a raise and it's well after the tax cuts
@charliekirk11 she was in charge of ONE OF NINE agencies that approved the sale of the Uranium One. If her agency did not approve the sale, it would only mean the president would review it with a little bit more attention. Please do not lie over twitter any longer.
@MichaelNeill1 @Education4Libs misreporting use of campaign funds is a felony and perhaps grounds for impeachment...but with the vault and deal made with his CFO there might be more info
@Education4Libs that might be the dumbest tweet I've seen you make, which is saying a lot....if the president is convicted after impeachment then a new vice president would have to be confirmed by the senate (and house), who of course would not confirm somebody that they just convicted
@realDonaldTrump no you're lying again. Please stop lying.
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump we'll where we are in a couple of years when the economy slows down and Trump gets more paranoid (if he is still around)
@simonamangiante I wish you'd go away. Petty distractions coming from you don't help us learn about this Russian conspiracy.
@DavidWohl Michael Cohen and Donald Trump tried to cover up a payment paid through the campaign. How is he not guilty?
@Dwayneyoung0808 @Education4Libs sort of beside the point because we were talking 400mm worth of money in question... but no they're Americans. They can donate to primaries and general elections.
@Education4Libs no she did not accept 400 million dollars from Russia. You're not even reporting Putin's made up story correctly; that the Ziff brothers donated $400 million.		They donated $17700 to Clinton's Campaign.
@DavidWohl funny parody..... only thing sickening is ahole comments like these challenging someone who actually is neutral without a dog in the fight
@itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump maybe but he doesn't have that much money
@st8blegenius @DanScavino @realDonaldTrump I gladly take pride that you think I'm an 'idiot,' as I don't take a bunch of random crap and try to put it all together and form some stupid sci-fi puzzle to come up with even stupider conclusions..
@PeteHegseth we'll see how well this economy stands with trumpism
@st8blegenius @DanScavino @realDonaldTrump now I got the q-people interacting with me....not in the mood to read about conspiracy crap....
@Education4Libs actually watched your video...you touched on some issues but mostly you complained about liberals victimizing conservatives when conservatives run this country
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump no I love with hunts and hate trump
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump what the f_ck are you talking about!!! Maybe 13mm of those dollars.
@TomiLahren where do you come up with this crap?
@TomiLahren Tomi that's a good thing. Dr. Ward is a nut job
@seanhannity thanks for updating the progress of this fruitless negotiation masterminded by your man president trump.
@JudgeJeanine @FoxNews I might watch it....I am impressed by your ridiculous theatrics after all the dominoes are falling
@Education4Libs because russia hacked into DNC computers and consulted with members of the Trump campaign, as Mueller has uncovered over the last two years....and guess what Republican Senators are not disputing most of this
@Education4Libs what a surprise you didn't read the story in depth but cited it on Twitter....you're referring to the NDAs that CIA people were required to sign, which they had already signed.
@realDonaldTrump this is great. you will go to China. A wannabe dictator meets with a dictator to improve relations for all of us.
@realDonaldTrump oh really...what a f_ckin' surprise....I thought you had stood up to them but I guess they aren't so scared of you after all...
@SophiaHelwani haven't seen you for awhile. Did you get lost in the Kremlin?
@senorrinhatch ok so you should vote on his complete body of work and release the transcirpts when judge Kavanaugh worked for Kenneth Starr
@realDonaldTrump I prefer CNN.. It reports on your lies whereas FOX lies about your lies.
@realDonaldTrump what the f_ck are you talking about Mr. Conman?
@ida_skibenes just want to pound sand when I see things like this
@Education4Libs @realTylerZed @GrrrGraphics sounds like compilation of made of crap....lot of that going around so it better be innovative.
@CaptainsLog2O18 @CNN saw most of the interview....brutal
@Education4Libs the justice department listed the president as a co-conspirator so they think he DID commit a felony.... Like anybody else he deserves a jury trial
Don Lemon; 'I can't get that 20 minutes of my life back, Chris'
@PreetBharara that's good to hear though I think we need to know what the hell happened with Russia
@Jim_Jordan you're lying. The FBI did not react on the dossier. They reacted on the tip they got from the Australian diplomat. Please stop lying.
@2naOnWhite @JohnBrennan just think you wanted to insult Mr. Brennan because he doesn't agree with you, which is despicable
@JohnBrennan we'll see if you're right...hoping you are
@Robert_Aderholt it looks to me like Trump committed crime...this is not grasping at anything. there is evidence.
@JackPosobiec why, did she participate in illegal campaign contributions?
@Vazhog @politico in this case most of them were to outside groups but it shows some of it went directly to the campaign. Trump raised more than 100mm....of course Mueller would have thrown the case to SDNY regardless-Cohen's case has nothing to do with Russia
@Vazhog @politico it's not true that he funded his own campaign...he funded more than half when he first announced candidacy but by the time the primaries rolled around he was taking contributions (a lot from rich people) https://t.co/mWDLbgXnRZ
@RudyGiuliani like your manipulation of words by putting 'phony' in front of the 'steele dossier.' Some unassuming people might believe what you're saying...
@politico that might be accurate....let him go anyway
@senorrinhatch enjoy your faustian bargain some more....it's only at our expense
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @ainsleyearhardt good, you'll say more incriminating things, which will help us take back our country
@Alyssa_Milano @maziehirono @SenMarkey @CoryBooker @KamalaHarris unfortunately we know these senators would never vote for him...we need gop people to stand up and realize this nomination is bad for our country
@CindyDytle @realDonaldTrump only the conman's bullsh_t on us honest folks
@realDonaldTrump that....and violated campaign finance laws....and probably colluded with russia....and just merely being one of those people that need to reinforce their self confidence by degrading others
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump I'm wondering why you'd infer that they're fake news. 'obsessing' over something that is true is not 'fake news'
@realDonaldTrump big deal my wages aren't increasing
@Education4Libs I'd love someone to lecture you on how evil and disingenuous president Trump is...unfortunately you're not processing any of the evidence
@simonamangiante sort of wish you'd go away and stop distracting us from pursuing justice
@LindseyGrahamSC the president likely committed a felony. You need to halt the nomination until this is resolved Period
@Jim_Jordan god, after your scandal, what went down yesterday, your opinions should have no merit
@realDonaldTrump he cheated on his taxes....the evidence clear as day....
@realDonaldTrump now are you saying a crime is not a crime? come on mr. conman you wouldn't do that.
@realDonaldTrump would feel bad for yourself
@Education4Libs we're outraged for her...there's many more Americans that do something like this. no fair minded people would say this is an epidemic
@AVets_wife2 @charliekirk11 what research have you done?
@usaforyoubruv @charliekirk11 why don't you provide proof of an illegal transaction (instead of baseless insults.) Reputable sources please.....
@charliekirk11 you're making this up. please stop
@realDonaldTrump they nailed him on the big one...not reporting taxes paid to him by a foreign entity, which also is intriguing because the crime was committed in a similar place where you were hanging out...very excited to see more
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump what planet are you on? there are tapes of them conspiring to make hush payments, which violates campaign finance contributions.
@eugenegu hope he's fair though Cohen's conspiracy with Trump put us into this mess...3-5 years seems ok with me, maybe a little bit harsher
@realDonaldTrump thanks for the tip...
@Poppylane_ @jmscheidler4 what's this supposed to mean?
@charliekirk11 thanks for trolling...let's keep the eye on the ball....president is involved in covering up campaign expense because he did not want the public to know about his two affairs
@SebGorka you guys can stop politicizing this. you made your point. now let this girl rest in peace
@TomiLahren it would be nice if you dropped the politics about this...you made your point now it's time to let her rest in peace
@senorrinhatch bullcrap, there's plenty of damning info on the nominee and what's sad is that you know it
@senorrinhatch that's amusing...now let's talk about our president being a crook and you can do your job and protect us before it's too late
@TomiLahren how you got famous for your opinion is beyond me....
@mschlapp that's a fantastic point...even though the president was implicated on a felony, you smarly point out that there was no 'russian collusion'
@TomiLahren yeah...only illegal immigrants kill people...it I were to guess 90% of the murders in this country are by illegal immigrants.
@gregolear @LindseyGrahamSC he;s not a traitor...he seems more like a p_ssy
@LindseyGrahamSC no but there's serious circumstantial evidence that there was collusion....and you're do nothing to help this investigation along
@realDonaldTrump can't wait to hear you talk about 'witch hunt'
@seanhannity do you have an opinion on this? If I was your council I'd recommend you'd shut up
@JudgeJeanine Judge, you're posting this crap after two of Trump cronies are official implicated in crimes, including one that involves the president....
@Jim_Jordan @POTUS @ICEgov Rep. Jordan, very excited to hear your views on Manafort and Cohen. I'm sure they're very informative.
@FoxNewsInsider @JudgeJeanine Ms. Judge, please opine on Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort today. I am so excited to hear your views. I'm sure they'll be very informative to American people.
@DavidWohl anyway what's your take on Michael Cohen pleading guilty to all those counts, including campaign fraud, which the president was clearly a co-conspirator?
@leezeldin @RichardGrenell @ICEgov yeah that's great....now why don't you opine on the big news of the day Manafort guilty and Cohen pleading guilty, including campaign finance violations
@DavidWohl that wasn't your tune a couple of days ago...you were excited about a possible acquittal....
@realDonaldTrump cool hopefully you'll talk about people committing bank fraud, tax evasion and hiding money
@sendavidperdue agreed about laws...first thing is to uncover the fraud committed by people close to the administration
@JudgeJeanine Judge Jeanine, got good news Manafort prosecuted for 8 felonies...looks like he's going to jail!!!! Yay!!!!! it's good when bad people go to jail!!!!!!!
@kriskeena1 @lauferlaw for sure...tax fraud is a felony
@lauferlaw nice...that was the big one!!!!!!
@ECMcLaughlin @MSNBC are you sure....thinking that they won't be announced until the other 10 are resolved
@funder unfortunately he does not have to cooperate
@SebGorka horsesh_t
@jeffwoolf95 @thehill thought she said she was running....look forward to her getting her out
@realDonaldTrump @PARISDENNARD @seanhannity somehow don't think that's true....
@ainsleyearhardt @foxandfriends @LindseyGrahamSC please tell me what it's like to be spineless
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump @PARISDENNARD @seanhannity @CNN @Acosta @FCC I disagree....I think it reports the news well
@krassenstein if we keep on fighting maybe #Resistance
@CBNNews we're getting somewhere....hopefully we won't have any books in the future
@marcorubio how about adressing this person in the white house who's gradually consolidating power?
@MovementCon @SethAbramson I'd personally be pissed if he wasn't tried again after a hung jury and I'm American.....
@Education4Libs I'd prefer to say that our kids get shot regularly in school and our politicians are not doing a damn thing about it
@RonEllis1 I'll skip those books and pay attention to Mueller's reports
@RonEllis1 don't think so, me nor my kind are acting like we're victims....
@DavidWohl Morning Joe's rating aren't bad...it's actually a good show to wake up to
@DeepStateShu well there's a lot of dumb things we here these day but it's fairly dumb
@goshenhawk1 @ProfMJCleveland @GeorgePapa19 @FDRLST your tweets are driving me up the wall...why don't you shut up and let Mueller do his job?
@realDonaldTrump Bob Mueller is not disgraced or discredited. he's quite honorable.
@realDonaldTrump you need to catch up on the facts my friend-especially in a case that you're in the middle of; there is collusion between Trump officials and the Russia. Whether it rises to conspiracy is what the honorable Bob Mueller is trying unravel
@RudyGiuliani Rudy, we want the truth (which is always the truth) no matter how long it takes....
@peggy78058129 @SophiaHelwani @realDonaldTrump what are you talking about!!!! Abortion is legal. It went through case law and obviously was decided as a legal act by 'interpreters of the law'..but I'm challenging you to cite the constitution as a means to say it is not legal...please don't make baseless comments
@peggy78058129 @nvrqt @JamesIsaak2 @realDonaldTrump @SophiaHelwani peggy, you seem to utter very simple reactions...why don't you put your money where your mouth is and opine on the 14th amendment?
@TRUMPkittyMommy @SophiaHelwani @realDonaldTrump suggesting I'm a pedophile....that's a fairly f_cked up comment.
@BlissAnnHerlihy @JamesIsaak2 @SophiaHelwani @realDonaldTrump agreed, I'll go a step further; Sophia is most likely a figment of someone's imagination and we need to stop her/them from spreading false crap
@SophiaHelwani @realDonaldTrump you got me 14 amendment...you still don't know it....		https://t.co/V5Ne2KmeJT
@SophiaHelwani @realDonaldTrump the privacy act, 4th amendment. Please read it so you can understand things better
@Education4Libs perhaps she's got a lot of tapes of him and his staffers saying damning things....breach of contract means nothing....it's his word against her tapes.
@SophiaHelwani @washingtonpost this is the 6th or 7th time you've shown this particular video....this is getting redundant....very reminiscent to Russian bot tweets
@GlobeChadFinn no
@RudyGiuliani I agree that the president has nothing to do with Russians, that's if 'truth isn't truth.'
@Education4Libs you're praying for the president over twitter and waiting for us to like it and giving supporting statement....you got to be effin' with me
@Goss30Goss about to see it...getting excited
@MichaelRCaputo @RepSwalwell right now I believe congressman swallwell....he actually has substance, whereas you call him a 'liar' along with some comedic video to distract us. you're a piece of work,
@Education4Libs agreed....only person more shallow and backstabbing is Donald Trump
@JudgeJeanine @usminority Trumo supporters are 'smarter and savvier than they are.' You got to be sh_tting me....
@JudgeJeanine Mr. Mueller did not want to testify because he literally had nothing to say...unlike president trump he's not in the middle of the investigation....again what you're saying crosses over into lying
@JudgeJeanine Hilary didn't funnel any money. The DNC legally paid for Steele who is a reputable agent
@JudgeJeanine Paul Manafort originally had an ankle bracelet but then he contacted witnesses of his case and then was put in solitary confinement
@JudgeJeanine the information backchannelled was not 'forbidden' nor was the Steele dossier 'fraudulent.'
@JudgeJeanine wow what you're saying makes no sense at all: Dems had nothing to do with hiring Bob Mueller.
@Shakazu49219075 @SophiaHelwani @Ollie_4300 @RudyGiuliani hope you got better than that....I put my own name and do not post Walk Away stories all day.
@FoxNews @dbongino Fox, you should do better than give this dbag all this airtime
@GByers18 @realDonaldTrump no that did not happen...that's not even the conspiracy theory. It's apparent that you have not read anything or even listened to Fox News with any real focus.
@Ollie_4300 @twitswits @SophiaHelwani @RudyGiuliani yeah Sophia put your money where your mouth is after posting all these walk away testimonials....you say you're an aspiring comedian. Please show us tapes of your performances.
@Shakazu49219075 @SophiaHelwani @Ollie_4300 @RudyGiuliani fair enough., won't go into too much detail... Work as an accountant, got a little yellow mut, drive a white honda civic....now please share your story. You claim to be a comedian, write MMA articles, please attach some performance videos so we can see who you are.
@SophiaHelwani @Ollie_4300 @RudyGiuliani no I think she's uttering something that the rest of us have been thinking. we honestly don't know if you're real.
@RudyGiuliani You'll release your report. We only care what Mueller has to say. It will be fact based.
@JudgeJeanine @RudyGiuliani @FoxNews cool we'll see him shoot himself in the foot unknowningly, while you gleefully smile, without a clue of how stupid his comments are.. For sure I'll be watching (as will Mr. Mueller.)
@funder there you are....you can't trust our commander and chief
@KimMartin615 @DavidWohl @rgoldmann no, Mr. Wohl was citing a quote where Mr. Brennan perhaps contradicted himself as a reason to have his security clearance revoked, which is of course ridiculous, as it has nothing to do with the protection of this nation.
@DavidWohl what you're saying has nothing to do with security of our country
@realDonaldTrump no I'm right now focusing on your mistakes.....
@realDonaldTrump It could though you provided those tax cuts for big companies to hoard all that money #conmanpresident
@foxandfriends @dbongino hey f_ckhead Bongino why don't you shut the f_ck up and let Mueller do his job?
@simonamangiante you're all over the place...first you said he didn't do anything and now you're arguing he cooperated....what the f is it?
@DEATHCON526 @Education4Libs we'll see what happens in November....
@RealistVeteran @josephhcosgrove @Education4Libs wow Joe made a point and you responded with a barrage of personal insults, including 'you have the merit of a pile of dog shit,' which doesn't even make sense since Joe was reacting to a comment and sharing nothing about himself. Recommend you tone down that crap.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends why don't you watch a real show like Morning joe? oh yeah because your ego's too fragile
@realDonaldTrump under you we're none of those things unfortunately....this is why I'm hoping that they prove you a Russia's dog, which I'm convince, you are
@Education4Libs Omarosa wasn't fired for lying. According to the tape she was fired for breathing ethics that the chief of staff did not elaborate on. You influence a lot of people. You should get your facts straight.
@Education4Libs the only opinion you ever utter is 'universal healthcare costs too much money.' Makes me think you have no idea of what a sh_tshow it is at the moment and how out of hand costs are
@inachu @SophiaHelwani lesson learned while we lived in a depression....good idea
@cryborg not dancing around the issue...we don't know how to get Trump's allies to process the danger of this presidency
@simonamangiante this is getting ridiculous....he lied to the FBI! we're living in an age where 2+2=3
@senorrinhatch Senator Hatch, it's not the democratic senators that need to see them....it's us people that wants to see the goddamn records and to see if it's okay for YOU to VOTE for him or if he has done/said SOMETHING that does not qualify him for the court
@senorrinhatch okay so get the goddman records from his time in the white house so we can all see them
@realDonaldTrump I prefer 'Grab her by the p_ssy.' That was your statement.
@Education4Libs @LauraLoomer @RealJack @thecjpearson @TheJordanRachel @realTylerZed deep state? Your guy controls the country...
@SloanGidding @Education4Libs sure, 10-30 years...what will be essentially life...this is hiding our money
@SloanGidding @Education4Libs good point couldn't care about the ostrich coats....I care about the 60mm he didn't pay taxes on
@Education4Libs probably....so you should now complain about judge Ellis constantly interrupting the Manafort process
@EricTrump there are reason why your father hired Omarosa, Steve Bannon and not Mitt Romney....he related to them
@EricTrump go no further than your father
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends and you're as responsible as a unassuming squirrel that just got its leg bitten off by a dog
@Victorysmaster @SophiaHelwani of course it is....I'm not going to change Sophia's mind....do not even know if Sophia's real, as she utters a lot of crap all day long when the rest of us have jobs...just want to exploit the simplicity of what she says, as she influencing a lot of people
@MLangbert @SophiaHelwani no Mitchell, it's more complicated...student loans, public retirement funds, individuals, union accounts, loan agreements, etc. are at stake....again I'm concerned this debate discounts the magnitude of what happened with Lehman. we don't live in a vacuum.
@SophiaHelwani your house analogy is elementary at best but stupid's probably a better word for it....they weren't betting their own house, they were betting houses of unknowing people.
@SophiaHelwani you cited companies that are a FRACTION of the size of the industry that's in question....further these companies were holding money of other institutions and individuals. You don't seem to understand the magnitude of the industry we're debating.
@simonamangiante your husband's guilty....why don't you stop hovering over him and let him help uncover this collusion?
@SophiaHelwani oh really.  the government did it your way with Lehman Brothers. Not only was Lehman destroyed but also all hedge funds, student loan companies, mutual funds, etc which impacted unknowing investors. You talk tough though if your money was involved you'd be bitching at G.W. Bush.
@SophiaHelwani @BGWhite42 @sndhandsmoke oh yeah if regulations were in place then this sh_tshow wouldn't even have happened...
@SophiaHelwani @BGWhite42 @sndhandsmoke I will try.....Imagine if AIG folded. It would've killed Deutche Bank, RBC, Goldman, Barclays in one swoop and then screwed over all those hedge funds, asset managers, depositors that did business with those companies. You have no idea the sh_tshow that it would've caused.
@BGWhite42 @sndhandsmoke @SophiaHelwani Sophia drew me into a conversation where she challenged me to provide content. I reluctantly agreed, doing my best in the limited space allotted. Now it's time for her to engage....
@realDonaldTrump actually he never made such claims...what he has said is more ambiguous. You twisting the truth makes you an AHOLE
@SophiaHelwani Sophia, I am impressed by you reposting these walk away stories...seems like you have an agenda
@Molly3186 no I want a president that doesn't utter outrageous lies to me everyday
@BGWhite42 @sndhandsmoke @SophiaHelwani though talking about this is much less effective than telling Sophia that she utters simple crap (and as you'll see she won't engage in any type of debate)
@BGWhite42 @sndhandsmoke @SophiaHelwani this is what I was afraid of....great recession: no regulation on subprime loans, which created real estate bubble, which caused mortgages to default, which insurance policies couldn't cover, which made the real estate market crash, which in affect crashed the stock market
@BGWhite42 @sndhandsmoke @SophiaHelwani Do you want us to refer to the great recession which had lax regulations or to industrial revolution where jobs were rampant along with impoverished conditions? Prefer to say her education on the subject sucks, as all she does is utter remarks for confused people to believe.
@SophiaHelwani @sndhandsmoke got plenty of substance and would whoop your misinformed ego anytime in an economic debate....though my 'bitching' makes much more of an impression on all the misinformed people that read your one to two liners.
@SophiaHelwani @sndhandsmoke not a bad point....we don't need to call you names...we only need to point to your rhetoric to discredit you (of course that's if you're real)
@KatrinaPierson @ErinBurnett @OutFrontCNN Katrina, you should not post a video where you verify that Trump said a racial slur if you want to protect him....
@SophiaHelwani @sndhandsmoke Sophia....you know nothing about economics. Why don't you stick to MMA (if you're actually real)
@TheFive @realDonaldTrump @greggutfeld who cares what you obstructionists think? you get paid to utter these crazy opinions and have conned voters believe them.  #Whowillsaveyoursoul
@LaraLeaTrump @EricTrump the economy that Obama created-much of it through government jobs that your father will get rid of because he can't afford them with his tax cut
@Education4Libs you made up a few of these facts-poverty wasn't up, insurance is a difficult issue to analyze, employment went as did median income up but let's see where middle america is in a couple of years after these tax cuts kick in and government has to cut jobs...
@realDonaldTrump though unlike you they didn't EMPOWER putin #getthetranslatortotestifytotheamericanpeople
@realDonaldTrump @Cabinet @WhiteHouse you and your imbeciles....
@SophiaHelwani @lionheartsmith I am intrigued to know who you really are....
@OMAROSA  if you love this country and you got tapes that will expose this president please share them and stop playing games!!!!!
@realDonaldTrump that's a lie the Boston Globe was sold for 70 mm to John Henry...
@krassenstein please don't be so confident....he is taking steps to usurp power like condemning ALL of the leaders of the Russian probe. WE NEED to continue to SPEAK UP and fight EVERY one of his decisions.
@SophiaHelwani @realDonaldTrump @DeliliaOMalley no she does not need to do anything of the sort....like a lot of us we are repulsed by president Trump for good reason and we will continue to speak out
@RealDonaldTrFan you got rid of someone's security clearance because they were mean to you? you are a narcissist....words cannot explain how scary these times are
@realDonaldTrump you're full of crap.....again
@Jim_Jordan aren't you the one that didn't know that phone calls couldn't be subpoenaed?....why don't you shut up and let the big boys figure this mess out...
@MinjaresBrian @Education4Libs Don't think so....as long as he's not divulging sensitive materials he should be able to speak like anybody else.
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity you actually appear to be the corrupt one
@PeteAbe Velazquez will be on the 25 man roster come playoff time so I'm not so worried. Kinsler will have to hit to be included.
@Desiletsles2 @Education4Libs underlings are fired all the time...just ask the president....with regards to your point, think you might be referring to the FBI....
@NanaRenans @Education4Libs no it's common for officials to keep their security clearance.
@Education4Libs wouldn't be so worried...Trump is banning perfectly competent people from holding on to their security clearances
@seanhannity you're full of crap...it's unfortunate that you influence so many people
@RandPaul as expected, you're full of crap...
@JudgeJeanine and you're full of crap, as always, just so you can make lots of money and have lots of fame
and you're too dangerous to be human being but sh_t happens I suppose
@VP hey Vice President Pence, our president is absolutely batty and you can do something about it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@FoxNews @SebGorka Sean Hannity, thanks for exposing us to two real intellectuals...their wisdom on this subject should survive the test of time
@costareports yeah this sucks to know....it will take years to clean up our judicial system
@DavidWohl @Dodgers @realDonaldTrump sorry to hear that....it looks like you're enjoying your beer at least
@cathymcmorris we should probably thank Obama before we become too deluded
@OMAROSA Omarosa, instead of doing the rounds, please share the evidence. Otherwise please get out of the rounds.
@Education4Libs @LauraLoomer they're there....listened to an NPR story about it today.
@GOP @DanaPerino Dana, perhaps you're right....though she was handpicked by the president who has handpicked and fired a lot of people before her. Why don't you opine on this before we discuss Omarosa?
@JudgeJeanine @seanhannity another shameless self promotion of your book....what an effin' surprise
@JudgeJeanine ...and you'll be on the wrong side of history
@DanScavino @realDonaldTrump though I'm sure you've seen him do disgusting things...that seems unavoidable
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch @MelissaAFrancis no don't think you're right...what it show us is that he was fired ....a lot of us still want to see what the special prosecutor finds
@funder don't know if he's the biggest but he is the most dangerous
@GovMikeHuckabee I'll pass
@realDonaldTrump As an American I feel fine with the way the investigation...so why don't we see it through and you can shut up in the process
@JudgeJeanine perhaps... but I don't think you could care less...the only thing you care about is if Trump stays president because you're receiving more fame and money at the moment than you ever thought you would
@Jim_Jordan agreed, now it's time for you to go
@krassenstein thank god...some parts of our judicial system continue to work...
@Glenn247 @Education4Libs thank you.... people on both sides of the government do believe in common decency and have spoken up in the past
@Cmhogan473 @Education4Libs are you effin' with me?...'MuslimPrivilege?' ....another straw man slogan from this straw man national movement
@Cmhogan473 @Education4Libs was mentioning scandals in general....want scandals involving women?....Elliot Spitzer, Tim Mahoney, John Edwards, Eric Massa, David Wu...don't tell me dems don't get held accountable
@realDonaldTrump actually I believe the tape....(and that your white house staff is a mess)
@Education4Libs you're full of crap, as always....Anthony Weiner, Al Franken, Rod Blagojevich, etc. Don't do the wo is us Republican bullsh_t. Plenty of dems get held accountable and we'll see about Ellison too...
@TomiLahren shut up. nobody's belittling the work of the military when they kneel.
@Education4Libs what the hell are you talking about?!!! most of us couldn't care less if they're kneeling. We're not choosing between football players and the military. We're watching a goddamn football game.
@EvanDrellich @trenni Evan, what are you talking about? I'd trade Bradley for a setup guy or a couple of prospects in a second.....we might now get passed the 1st round because our relief pitching sucks....
@SophiaHelwani @BillKristol @ira how does this have anything to do with Bill Kristol's comment....you post weird stuff....beginning to think you're a bot....
@realDonaldTrump @GovMikeHuckabee @foxandfriends my paycheck's not bigger. I don't have a pension....you are out of touch with the real American worker
@realDonaldTrump @harleydavidson what the f are you talking about? Where are Harley competitors building new factories....another dumb_ss lie from lying, Conman Donald.
@realDonaldTrump @DarrellIssa @foxandfriends no don't think so....we probably know the whole story of the 'coverup' and it obviously wasn't much of a hindrance for you to become president
@SenBobCasey agreed....now why don't you face the hard facts that a huge percentage of people are racist (including a lot of doofuses from your state) and confront them
@marcorubio please spare us the goddamn bible and all its lovely symbolism and actually do what's right for us, not what your keeps your party together (otherwise you'll always be 'little Marco Rubio'
@realDonaldTrump @JudgeJeanine the investigation is not based on the Steele Dossier, Lying Donald Trump...
@SophiaHelwani @realDonaldTrump what stupid parallel are you drawing now? Russia is a foreign actor, actually an adversary, these social media networks are blocking accounts because they don't want legal issues.
@realDonaldTrump thanks for the unifying message....after what's happened over the last year and half wish I thought it was sincere
@realDonaldTrump I'd prefer to look at the winners you've hired to help make america great again: Pruit, Ross, Manafort, or some the a-holes you have close ties with, Nunes, Collins. Good luck with calling people out for their incompetence/corruption.
@benjaminwittes wonder if I can adopt this thing....
@realDonaldTrump all the rants remind me of one thing....you're in serious trouble.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump you're absolutely right, let's ignore this crap...let's focus on legitimate stories instead like the Russian meeting in the Trump tower...
@senorrinhatch @judicialnetwork senator Hatch, you continue to not stand up to Trump.
@JudgeJeanine @seanhannity rather watch the MSNBC giving up to date coverage about the conspiracy by the trump campaign
@realDonaldTrump shut your mouth whether they protest or not has nothing to do with the entertainment value
@GovMikeHuckabee no, not true. A judgement was made and the justice department disobeyed a legal judgement so the judge stopped the deportations, which he SHOULD have done.
@JudgeJeanine wow what a f_ckin surprise. Instead of opining on the Devin Nunes tape or speaking about all the mounting circumstantial evidence against our president, you plug your book....
@AFish1976 @Education4Libs chain migration
@CLewandowski_ what's your f_ckin' point? People do desperate things to get in the country...
@Education4Libs devils in the details: they did it legally through a program that Donald Trump wants to abolish, which would make him (and you) a hypocrite.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @POTUS remember you're the scholar that wanted to advance creative design.
@realDonaldTrump what's you position on Chris Collins?
@RepChrisCollins that was a heartfelt speech though it seems that the FBI caught you on tape. Why don't you spare us the bs and resign?
@RandPaul you gotta be f_cking with us!!!!!
@KaivanShroff wish it was that easy....
@cap916 @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump @Troy_Balderson think the leads insurmountable unfortunately....there is November
@IngrahamAngle aren't you guys supposed to be the party of thick skin and you're taking offense over this?
@realDonaldTrump think Putin stumping for him would've been effective than you
@SophiaHelwani no it actually isn't...more importantly you don't know jack about the tax code...nobody literally spends 39.6% of their earnings off taxes. They itemize their deductions, make a lot of earning off CG and dividends and put a lot of their money into retirement accounts
@Education4Libs Liberals are not trying to normalize pedophilia. You continuously spout this crap, knowing that it will stick with people that do not read up on politics.
@Education4Libs thanks for sugar picking something to enhance your argument. Of course you just destroyed the left's gun position in one tweet.
@seanhannity that's great....Devin Nunes unfortunately has no credibility
@RachelAzzara @DemsWork4USA @sharicedavids good luck KS dems....even if you don't win you're doing a great service providing alternatives to Kansas
@Education4Libs you raise a good point. Trump probably belongs in the same class as Roger Ailes, Matt Lauer, Charlie Rose, Louis C.K., Russell Simmons.		Mount Rushmore is a bit of a stretch
@GovMikeHuckabee Jim Acosta's in your head.....
@realDonaldTrump his opponent has said time and time again he does not support Nancy Pelosi
@realDonaldTrump why the hell do we want another one of your silly minions spouting off crap in congress?
@RudyGiuliani why don't you sue your law school for all the idiotic things you've said of late?
@TomiLahren not necessarily but I sure as hell wouldn't want someone like you to be in charge of handling immigration because your streets smart is that of a poodle....
@krassenstein don't know about Rand Paul...agree with the rest of the list...would add Mark Meadows, Ron DeSantis.
@TomiLahren also I think you're full of crap....if you knew anything about cocaine, most users think it's a little too precious to put on the street to snort it but of course you got pristine values....
@TomiLahren what planet do you live on???? welcome to America. Why don't you go to Ashland, OH or any other place in middle America and you'll see middle aged ladies snorting crystal.
@ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump @SenatorKelly agreed....this next tax cut will simply mean that money stays in bank account....not much different than the great recession
@Ocasio2018 yeah we just gave the banks money at a low interest rate and they did whatever they wanted with it....in most cases invest in foreign currency
@tribelaw obviously this is illegal....let's be quiet and let Mueller do his job because much worse crimes might have happened that we need to learn about
@seanhannity having watched you over the last twenty years I don't think you posting this is sincere.
@SophiaHelwani @JohnCFischer_ funny you say that....I'd say the same thing about the right
@Education4Libs but a couple of them are not true...CNN is not fake news. Don Lemon does not spread propaganda....Trump does not swing back at anybody. He has not made any comments towards Michael @MichaelAvenatti or @StormyDaniels. Just to add one indisputable thing; Trump is Putin's bitch.
@SophiaHelwani that's a very broad way of looking at it....those companies are an absolute fraction of apple and don't have the economies of scale that apple have....do you not remember the banking crisis or the automobile crisis...they needed to be bailed out
@secularcitizen2 @GOP the world is f_cked up place at times...hope she gets the medical attention she has a RIGHT to have
@RepMarkMeadows @realDonaldTrump @Jim_Jordan yeah and this could be reversed in a couple of years when the president's asinine tax cuts and trade tariffs kick in
@Lady_Star_Gem @realDonaldTrump agreed, couldn't say it better myself
@realDonaldTrump he's not...but if he is I'd still prefer him as a puppet over your proposed puppet Balderson
@JonHeyman agreed...
@SenatorLankford who cares? I'm not seeing any of it.....
@micheal2474 @SophiaHelwani @RealDark_Kent @realDonaldTrump I acknowledged that Bernie complained about the Democratic nomination process ie: superdelegates, waserman-schulz....the essence of your tweet was that Bernie knew that Hillary was corrupt. He did not know like us all until after the election when Donna Brazil's book came out.
@micheal2474 @SophiaHelwani @RealDark_Kent @realDonaldTrump thanks Michael. Won't get into a fact finding argument with you because I'm sure I'll get a lot of unoriginal, poorly placed insults. He called it 'unfair' because the people RUNNING the committee were biased. He did not know about the corruption until after the election.
@micheal2474 @SophiaHelwani @RealDark_Kent @realDonaldTrump what you're saying is not true....though if it was, he did it to avoid the chaos that we have now...
@JohnCDick @SophiaHelwani that list is bullsh_t!!!!! Read the story below. Wish aholes like you were banned from twitter. 	https://t.co/6L8tLvPkSw
@SophiaHelwani your stupidity of comparing the 'Democrats' of 1860s to the Democrats of today is impressive...keeping the sanctity of the confederate flag is a Republican value the comes to mind
@realDonaldTrump #throwingyoursonunderthebus
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump this is more or less how I read the tweet...  	#throwingyoursonunderthebus
@realDonaldTrump no, what your son did is NOT legal. He should get jail time for it.
@DeepStateShu @MichaelAvenatti I got sympathy for them if they voted for Trump....they were conned
@realDonaldTrump keep up with the con
@Education4Libs for starters Avenatti is REPRESENTING a porn star, which is a legal occupation.....	Next, anybody deserves the dignity to be represented whatever their profession or situation-that's the American system
@realDonaldTrump watching your speech....just saw you saying you only ruin careers if people disagree with you...you just admitted to being a narcissist
@foxandfriends @dbongino Dan Bongino, you continue your dumb act when all you really care about is promoting your dumb brand...hoping Fox will soon tire of your con crap act
@Dionh410 @ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump @dannyoconnor1 Hoping you 'll reconsider......
@realDonaldTrump Coming from Putin's puppet
@realDonaldTrump Pennsylvania voted against you in the last congressional election....let's hope Ohio does the same
@foxandfriends @dbongino Hey Fox, you continue to cover this quack's career
@benito_mg2017 @RepMarkMeadows Oh wow now you're reverting to personal attacks...recommend you get a pedicure. That should relax you (a little)
@benito_mg2017 @RepMarkMeadows hillary/smillary, who caares?  We got a juicy investigation that is quite entertaining and revealing embarrassing stuff about the president. Better than Days of Our Lives....
@ChrisJZullo they'll flip Nevada, Arizona, Tennessee and Texas...that would be 4
@EricTrump @washingtonpost @JeffBezos you're either full of crap or delusional like your dad
@benito_mg2017 @RepMarkMeadows that's up to you....though this investigation is about TRUMP and RUSSIA and any fair minded individual would concur
@Education4Libs Why don't you take an economics class so you can understand some of the political issues better?
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews what the f_ck are you saying? Democrats don't want the economy to be good? please listen to yourself speak. What human wouldn't want to make more money to have more resources?
@JudgeJeanine you're absolutely batty
@benito_mg2017 @RepMarkMeadows keep the eye on the ball please. not about Hillary
@RepMarkMeadows You are the king of introducing esoteric evidence that it takes several hours/days to refute....you're only delaying the inevitable evidence that we will soon see: Trump CONSPIRED with Russia
@trish_regan @POTUS well he's a traitor so how much of a fair shake should he get?
@JudgeJeanine @seanhannity @FoxNews oh can't wait to watch you spout truthisms and all that wonderful stuff that reminds us what a fantastic president Donald Trump. Hopefully you'll have that Bongino scholar teaching us economics...
@mike_pence Mr. Pence when are you going to declare Trump unfit for office? He is off the hinges right now.
@Rasmussen_Poll @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I doubt this....
@GovMikeHuckabee Mr. Huckabee, you know how dumb you're making yourself look?....you're making fun of Jim Acosta because he was 'upset' over the press secretary not agreeing to simply say that the press 'is not the enemy of the people.'
@GovMikeHuckabee @RealJamesWoods I actually don't find that funny at all but another reckless comment that I see everyday
@Education4Libs I'm never surprised by your simplistic analyses of political systems (though I'm always amused)
@EddieZipperer @MZHemingway do we have to get intellectual about this issue when Trump is beyond full of crap and purposely exploiting the media to enhance his power? #conman
@FFRF great fuc_in' quote!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Please put this up on a billboards across the south and heartlands of America
@NTKNet little bit tired of liberal biased news but all other news lies to me so I'll stick with the snowflakes
@GovMikeHuckabee wow you're funny....now please tell your daughter not to lie to us anymore
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump agreed democrats aren't doing enough to get rid of Trump.
@realDonaldTrump no I think she disagrees with you because she does not like to appear irrational like you
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump she might be if we grant you your wish to become a strongman...
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump I'll talk about it with you all you want....I haven't seen any more money. Actually all I've seen is much more investing on the stock market and few sensible people scared sh_tless by the possible recession in a couple of years because Trump's throwing away government resources.
@theihateshirts @Stephanie32866 @JudgeJeanine @realDonaldTrump I didn't get a tax break....I actually got doubled whammied...less tax deductions on sch a and higher rate in tax bracket
@foxandfriends @Judgenap don't worry they have the evidence
@senorrinhatch except for the three years that were his most controversal
@OfficialJonZal good luck with that
@AriFleischer @Acosta Ari, that's a ridiculous comment. College campus kids are overreacting and immature. This was absolute venom....whatever your political views you have stop this
@atrupar @thinkprogress also congrats on the shoutout
@atrupar @thinkprogress good to see the news talking about tax cuts and the false beliefs that it actually stimulates the economy....that theory has been debunked time and time again; though the general public never seems to process this.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends I actually prefer watching those stations because they're covering a very interesting conspiracy
@foxandfriends sick of these culture wars that Trump has exploited....perhaps Fox should cover the real story: possible conspiracy
@FoxNews @POTUS another example of somebody with their head up their a__ and of course Fox and Friends is all over this crap....let's get some normality in the white house then we can 'all work together.'
@JudgeJeanine poor guy. I wish he knew that not even the author believe this crap
@Gaddeus @BikerChick9999 @Acosta think shep is the best journalist out there....goddam shame that he's wasting away on the 3:00 time slot, working for such a sh_tshow of a cable station
@BikerChick9999 @Acosta no Jim is a real journalist who doesn't say things that people want to hear. He actually can be in a room and deal with a bunch of people shouting slurs at him but still listen to these people with open ears.
@FoxNews @dbongino @realDonaldTrump hey dan bongino, hopefully after this whole thing is done, you'll be shamed and we won't have to listen to your bs no longer....
@Education4Libs because he says 'the one who is unwilling to work shall not eat' is proof that he's not a socialist?  So you're saying it's a fact that socialists don't work? Do you know how stupid that sounds?!!!!
@SenatorCollins that sounds so dandy but to really assure protection from Russia you need to impeach the big guy
@JudgeJeanine Yeah who cares? Hillary lost. Now we need to focus on collusion between Trump and Russia.
@seanhannity who cares? we already have evidence that the president was involved.
@tedcruz Texans, I really hope you vote for a real person and not this craft that couldn't stick up for himself during the election. Go Beto!!!!!
@JudgeJeanine @realDonaldTrump it's more or less stayed the same. when some of the tariffs and tax cuts start to kick in then it might get much worse.
@SenWarren Trump just called for Sessions to fire Mueller. You need to be screaming not post other tweets at the moment.
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump 'vast majority' you're full sh_t
@FoxNews @RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump yeah agreed. unfortunately Trump has muddied the waters with his crap that people in power are now bullied and confused
@sharonlwhite25 @FoxNews @RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump agreed Trump is full of crap.
@rob_omgwtf @JudgeJeanine oh really he's the most the famous press reporter and you do a 'Jim who?'
@ZevShalev @jeffsessions @realDonaldTrump no actually he should do nothing and let the objective investigator tell us what happened
@krassenstein @Acosta the guy can take a pounding that's for sure
@realDonaldTrump you make no sense
@Trump454545 'catupulting the economy.' We'll see what will happen when companies pay almost half the taxes next year....
@JudgeJeanine Agreed, let's stop Hillary from speaking so voters won't be tainted when realizing how vile the Republican party is at this moment
@SophiaHelwani @TheCountryBoys no words can speak to the stupidity of this tweet except to say you're using technicalities to create BS. Unfortunately it impresses upon a lot of ignorant folks and at the same time incites unknowing people that want to make an honest attempt dispute this crap.
@glamelegance @realDonaldTrump some of those doofuses loved him unfortunately. Hopefully southern Florida will come out this time
@MonicaCrowley @realDonaldTrump it's funny you say this...I think he's full of crap
@tonyposnanski I'm watching this too. It's so hard to criticize because everything is rhetoric and lies.
@gporter0071 @seanhannity don't think so....
@SophiaHelwani @KrystalMylan obviously that's a stupid comment meant to piss off people that disagree with you
@gporter0071 @seanhannity no, you're diverting the conversation by forming a false equivalency. Let's not resort to elementary tactics. Sean should address what Rudy Giulianni inferred....that there was collusion.
@MichaelAvenatti nice...please continue being loud
@SenAlexander @POTUS @SenatorEnzi @IvankaTrump @SenBobCasey @PattyMurray thanks for pointing this out....let's now do something that concerns all Americans and Impeach!!!!
@mskristinawong @MichaelAvenatti how 'bout a few more months than we can take it away?
@DeepStateShu @thehill @SecretaryPerry @realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVosED you got a good trio....I'll say the Big Boy Donald, himself.
@MichaelAvenatti you might be right though I don't think Mueller would be dumb enough to admit that and lose an important card
@DeepStateShu maybe some type of negotiation....just want him out with the least damage possible so we can put this circus behind us.
@BenedictEvans @rflax who cares....let's do it anyway. their massive size is of no benefit to us
@RealAlexJones sign a petition for someone involved in collusion...doofus
@Education4Libs what an imaginative idea.
@ClaudiaLeFevre1 @Education4Libs what? reread the tweet.
@Education4Libs your tweets drive me crazy... your comparing what Spike Lee said to something that happened 160 years ago?
@ericgarland you might be right....we need to pressure to act on the evidence
@DeepStateShu I'll be happy if he get's the hell out and doesn't put us through a constitutional crisis
@gporter0071 @seanhannity I agree. Hilary lost so let's not talk about her. Let's talk about collusion.
@realDonaldTrump you're right for the wrong reasons....ratings will dry up because they're not covering collusion
@seanhannity why don't discuss the story of the day...that Rudy more or less admitted to collusion?
@realDonaldTrump now I'm actually convinced there was
@SophiaHelwani @watinsky you want middle america to survive this is the one government institution you want to preserve
@SophiaHelwani @watinsky that's total crap...we'd enter a great recession if we even tried to deregulate higher education. Take a macroeconomics class please
@SophiaHelwani @watinsky yeah you know as much about free trade as Rudy knows about the law
@bradfo 2 prospects that will make the majors for a has been and we lose 10 picks in next year's draft...love your work but can't agree. I want players to route for when we lose Bradley, Boegarts, Rodqiguez,
@JayB_124 agreed. the law has to go so jurors can't acquit aholes like that guy
@SophiaHelwani @funder not blaming the Russians for any of that.....though they're thieves, oppressors and murderers and want my president to stop colluding with them
@JonJusth @TheRickWilson agreed
@SophiaHelwani no we impose our morals and often complain...we just don't get conned by a 2nd tier wise guy
@SophiaHelwani @funder what would be the other choice? To vote for someone that colluded with Russia?
@IngrahamAngle @MSNBC Laura, why don't you put your eye on the ball and discuss Rudy's remarks, more or less admitting to collusion? That's the flavor of the day.
@BrittMcHenry if Trump cooperated it would've been much cheaper
@FoxNews what a fantastic opinion though perhaps it's more important to talk about Rudy admitting to collusion today.
@realDonaldTrump got a question off the subject. What's it like to be completely duped by some unsophisticated dictator running some dipsh_t country?
@MattMan_IWS @Jayman_IWS @dbongino @FoxNews just got blocked by @dbongino.....,myself, for such a big guy that loves to show off his bulk, he's a bit of sop
@StopTrump2020 He is...he has no choice. If he doesn't take complete control he cannot lift Russian sanctions and he'll exposed. I could be wrong (hope I am) but doubt it.
@realDonaldTrump @RandPaul let's talk about collusion you have denied committing but looks like you did. If you're still with us after that then we can vote up and down on your judge
@albvan58 @Dham1981 @dbongino thanks for the blessing...I'll let you take a stab at this also. Rudy seemed to infer that there was collusion through his remarks instead of claiming 'no collusion,' at all. Please speak to it.
@LevinTV your whipping out another BS argument hoping it will stick...what a surprise
@realDonaldTrump thank you for the introduction for John James though I'd prefer a democrat to vote you out
@KSLcom senator, you're such a patriot. now go a step further and say that we need to impeach trump or are you too much of a craft by now?
@Dham1981 @dbongino no, he's avoiding the big discussion. Why don't you speak for him or do you have nothing to say either Mr. MAGA?
@dbongino On another note, Rudy just switched her defense. Now he's saying 	'collusion is not a crime.' Why don't you speak to that instead of posting adds for your redundant podcasts and what is probably another meaningless book.
@IAmJamesStewart the Red Sox will still beat them
@NightmareUSA a known fake news website....why don't you change your handle to 'I'm full of crap'?
@dbongino let's see where we are in a couple of years...think you might not know what you're talking about
@RandPaul you prove to be pu__y. Congrats on your bs reputation as an independent thinker
@Education4Libs give it a couple of years...we'll see the actually results from the tax cuts, tariffs, etc.
@Education4Libs you're the master of taking crap out of thin air, throwing it against the wall and seeing it will stick
@realDonaldTrump You seem very angry yourself. You need to breath and get a glass of water and watch what your saying. You might sound irrational if you think about it.
@tonyseig @RoseDru63 @realDonaldTrump agreed not at all fed up. I'm very optimistic that we're going to get the full story from Mueller.
@realDonaldTrump I recommend you pursue counseling. These outbursts are unbecoming and they kill the mood for everybody else.
@Education4Libs when you finally get an enema we'll be able to fit you in our pockets
@senrobportman good for you....we want somebody who will hold ALL Americans accountable for their crimes....otherwise the guy should not be joining the court
@Davelash23 @BusybodyMs @realDonaldTrump trolling someone of being a pedophile when there's no evidence makes you a Grade A sh_tf_ck.  Also your five groupies can go f_ck themselves....
@FoxNews @VP wow Fox News is still a sounding board for the Trump campaign. When you guys stop doing this crap and give your viewers space to think for themselves then we all can decide if Trump is a worthy president
@FoxNews @DevinNunes @MariaBartiromo Devin Nunes, the guy who snuck into the WH at midnight to provide the president with important info about the investigation....yeah he's really credible....fox news, stop spouting this crap so your minions will stop believing this crap
@VP @POTUS I would like some of that money
@realDonaldTrump we welcome your idea of shutting down the government....hopefully Schumer won't balk at you bullsh_t like he has done so much lately
@EricShawnTV @FoxNews @aacuna1 @ArthelNeville @Stoltmann1971 now you make this doctoring crap
@FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC @MariaBartiromo Fox news is the only thing keeping this presidency alive....
@Education4Libs another stupid over-generalization uttered by you, Dylan. Obviously Californians would care if someone knowingly spread HIV because it could kill them or if somebody shat on the street because it smells bad.
@ronniem22464161 @PAngo329 @CorbieCrow @realDonaldTrump though we're a bit smarter.... if we ever go there we'll figure you out.
@Education4Libs don't think so....Trump's main initiative, the massive tax cut, which was Paul Ryan's baby does not kick in til next year...we'll see how well his economy does when the government has less revenue and has to cut jobs or companies hoard cash because they've hit peak margin share
@JudgeJeanine @dbongino @ChristopherHahn hey judge, watching your very ignorant show....please let me know when the conman's tax plan starts kicking in. Then we'll see how well this country's economy will do.
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine since when did those well paying blue collar jobs come back? sure we've got a low unemployment, where we all get pd crap
@Michael_D_Crow @dbongino we'll see next year when the tax breaks kick in and the government has to lay off a few workers, companies consolidate their money and have more leverage to negotiate with you-then we can judge your man's presidency. Otherwise I'd thank Obama for your fortunes
@TomiLahren indeed a lot of them are bankrolling smugglers, otherwise your tweet makes no sense
@FoxNews hey dumb people, the government hasn't collected the taxes under Trump tax cut yet so we don't know how the economy will respond with these lower taxes
@Education4Libs who the f_ck said this? you stupid sensationalist!!!!
@Education4Libs that is one of the dumbest rants you've gone on, which is saying a lot. Demi Lovato is very popular. Of course she's going to get media coverage. What f_ckin' world do you live in?
@JanzforCongress we need to stay on high alert....hopefully you'll boot Nunes out
@tedcruz Texans, I hope you get a goddam enema and vote O'Rourke!!!!!!!
@realDonaldTrump cool hopefully you can address your collusion
@Michael_D_Crow @dbongino hmmm....when president pisses in your mouth, recommend using a funnel, pee will go down easier
@realDonaldTrump hmmm....I don't believe you.
@dbongino with Cohen saying Trump knew about the Russia meeting, that would be evidence of collusion.... a better question for this forum is if Donald Trump pissed in your mouth, would you do a godda_m thing about it?
@realDonaldTrump let's not talk about the dumba__es that voted for you....let's talk about your collusion instead #collusion
@realDonaldTrump that's great to hear. Now let's talk about your collusion scheme #collusion
@agentbeach1 @EBSinger @RepAdamSchiff wouldn't be so sure Trump is going down....litigation will be a bitch especially when he has a choice; jail or white house. don't look forward to the these next couple of years
@dbongino how about discussing this collusion thing instead?
@RepAdamSchiff that's called collusion #collusion
@realDonaldTrump @AlanDersh I plan on watching the news and learn more about your colluision #collusion
@realDonaldTrump more interested to discuss this collusion #collusion
@AmandiOnAir forgot to mention the nightmare litigation
@knot4nothin @sick1weary0425 @charliekirk11 wow we're going in a new direction with this chat with open border. On the most part I don't agree. Never seen much evidence that 'illegal criminal aliens' take jobs away from poorer lower skilled workers. Think this is an ageless myth. Recommend you look into this.
@HollyToucheck @DOriginalDonald @sick1weary0425 no, was only talk about southern democrats of 1930s-1970s. They do not resemble democrats of today. They actually resemble a lot of Republicans to a great deal.  that's why I challenged the comment above.
@JanzforCongress @DevinNunes Mr. Janz, just donated to you. Time to lead your district to a more sensible place.
@brandythebtch @NadineNardine @remulb36 @Robfortrump2020 @realDonaldTrump yuck
@knot4nothin @sick1weary0425 @charliekirk11 what you're mentioning above is a partisan issue. It's very common for people without driver's licenses to vote democrat (especially minorities). Those are the statistics. It's common sense for democrats to fight for these people, as it increases their votes.
@HollyToucheck @DOriginalDonald @sick1weary0425 you missed understood what I said. I'm saying these people do not resemble the Democratic party of today. Of course we all know that although populism in the south had some liberal traits it evolved/matured into a more conservative ideology.
@realDonaldTrump got one little question, 'What does it feel like to be pissed on?' Oh sorry there's no evidence that that actually happened. I should stop making crap up.
@HollyToucheck @DOriginalDonald @sick1weary0425 who cares? their politics were their politics. They were populists. Let's keep the eye on the ball.
@sick1weary0425 @knot4nothin @charliekirk11 hmm, don't think anything what you said is true. Don't think dems believe minorities are incompetent. I suppose you're abstractly referring to programs like affirmative action, food stamps, etc. to make your argument? That seems silly.
@HollyToucheck @DOriginalDonald @sick1weary0425 think it was 18 senators that participated in parts of the filibuster-all of them were from the south and a lot of them were populist-very business minded senators; Strom Thurmond, Robert Bird, Russell Long, Richard Russell, James Eastland, William Fulbright, Ervin Russell
@ElisaDoucet3 @charliekirk11 thanks for the insult...never called Republicans racist. just don't think it's a party that has pushed minorities interests
@MichaelLegris2 @charliekirk11 Ok this is a hard conversation to have but I'll drop a few of the democrats names: Strom Thurmond, Richard Russell, Russell Long. The whole filibuster was done by southern democrats that did not want integration. I would not call these people liberals.
@Russelltucker15 @charliekirk11 hmmm....thank you for opening a discussion. believe it or not most Black families are not on food stamps. Black people that escape poverty usually have access to good public education, good government assistant programs, supportive police, etc. In other words: good governance
@sick1weary0425 please provide facts to refute my point. Always up for discussion.
@knot4nothin @charliekirk11 please back this up with an example...haven't seen many minorities indulge in the goodness of the Republican party
@charliekirk11 what's your point...that was 58 years ago. should we even mention the fact that those democrats are more like republicans now?
@literide @SenatorLankford calling you ignorant of a fact should be tolerable in a civil discussion....I'll address your point that you are not thinking about strategy; how can you make a decision about a president's performance without anticipating the result? (We won't know the result for 2-3 years.)
@marcorubio @GeoffDuncanGA hmmm....actually would like to see the lovely lady win. hopefully her nomination will bring some Georgians out so we don't we have to deal with more of the same Southern conservative crap that affects us northerners too.
@mbrooksmd1 @traciemac_Bmore yes, we all should be pressuring Cohen to tell us everything so we can resolve things quickly
@traciemac_Bmore don't think so. this guy is a thug, just like his boss. tape is a warning for Trump to give him a pardon. let's hope Guiliani continues to provide horrible representation so we can get these tapes quicker
@realDonaldTrump lot of this could've been resolved if we stayed in the tpp...
@marcorubio ok then do it
@literide @SenatorLankford never called you a name, called you ignorant of a fact
@literide @SenatorLankford no temper at all...just remarking on your ignorance of a major fact about the NOK developments.
@Southeast70D @EdTrishned2 @Education4Libs sometimes though it's also believing BS, especially when it's what you wish to hear.
@Southeast70D @EdTrishned2 @Education4Libs oh continue, please provide one of the many stories that got refuted but that you insist is true.
@Zigmanfreud disagreeeee...think it's another example of what a thug this doofus is
@Southeast70D @Education4Libs Sure live right on the coast. I see seals all the time. With regards to the birth certificate it has been produced for all of us to see. I believe it like I believe the validity of any birth certificate. We don't need to spin BS when we have hard facts.
@Southeast70D @EdTrishned2 @Education4Libs other than the fact he showed his birth certificate, Mr. Gullible
@SenBobCorker @MikeCrapo that's wonderful now be a goddam patriot and reject Kavanaugh
@BrettHamil @dbongino @VicBergerIV @DLoesch @OliverLNorth @NRA @NRATV that's a great portrayal of us liberals....do we believe in preserving dog sh_t to make sure everyone has something to eat too?
@SenCapito @uscapitol great picture now why don't you focus on the tapes between Trump and Cohen
@JeffFlake hey Jeff, show some balls, reject Justice Kavanaugh so we can make sure that the president talks with Mueller.
@IngrahamAngle @Reince @AlanDersh @mschlapp oh wow. what's your opinion? Can't wait to hear it!  I'm sure you'll look at it like the rest of it. That Trump is shady, wanting to pay cash to Karen and that this should be looked into further by the justice dept.
@FoxBusiness @SenatorTimScott it's great to hear you discuss finance...now let's talk about Trump offering to pay Karen in cash
@senrobportman @MSNBC wow that's interesting!!! now why don't you opine on the Trump tape released tonight?
@OrrinHatch what a great tweet....now let's talk about the tapes Cohen lawyer released tonight. I think Trump's guilty of a lot felonies....now what do you think?
@Education4Libs no Trump is getting looked at because there's a strong chance that he was involved with Russia
@funder he'll do a couple of more fu__ed up things to this country before resigning
@realDonaldTrump I might get to it but right now I'm focused on the tapes regarding you and all the broads you popped
@MichaelAvenatti please keep talking and pressure these dipf_cks to tell the truth
@traciemac_Bmore except the more the big doofus is exposed the more desperate he'll get. not looking forward to these next couple of months.
@Education4Libs little bit concerned about that...more concerned that he's buffoon that does not know how to make deals and therefore Iran will get their nuclear bomb
@JonHeyman @Ken_Rosenthal @Joelsherman1 didn't have the groceries
@JacobAWohl you're right not a huge scoop but pretty big. will hear the huge scoop in a couple of weeks. Don't worry everything will be transparent
@Southeast70D @Education4Libs yeah and it's been proven. very impressed by your gullibility. Let me know where you live so I can sell you a few seals out of the sea.
@EdTrishned2 @Southeast70D @Education4Libs no, wouldn't be a problem at all.
@Education4Libs wow, you're insinuating that Obama wasn't born in this country when of course he was and it was proven by him for the whole world to see. What a stupid remark.
@CurtisHouck @conservmillen @CRTV Sacha Baron Cohen is freaking genious
@literide @SenatorLankford Unless you put all your trust in Trump or other partisan agents. Hoping you're more independent than that.
@literide @SenatorLankford Since NOK has not launched a test rocket, that makes you trust Trump's strategy? The point is for them to give up the bomb...and we have to assess if North Korea is going in that direction. We cannot do that unless reports are submitted somehow.
@literide @SenatorLankford sure. I'll bite my tongue and swallow it. Though I'm not naive and I read the details (unlike Senator Lankford.) Nothing that they're doing should lead us to think they're going to get rid of their arsenal.
@GovMikeHuckabee think you're full of crap.
@SenatorLankford Horsecrap. North Korea did nothing other than take down a tired, worn out nuclear testing site. Lankford, you're full of crap.
@ClintLongwell @dbongino no speaking in layman's. Do you wish to get legal? Why don't you list the string of events involving Papadopoulos according to the FBI and mention what Dan is disputing. You should be able to do it in one or two tweets.
@realDonaldTrump actually you're probably trying to lift the Obama sanctions that practically bankrupted Russia. we need to stop you from doing this.
@ClintLongwell @dbongino no, Dan is referring to a technicality to try to make his point but they got a crap load more on this guy but they made a plea deal. onward and upwards. Let's see what's going on. Less interference by Bongino and public figures would be nice.
@dbongino there are no disputes. he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge because he did not want to get prosecuted. Onward and upwards to see what the hell is going on.
@nepafortrump @realDonaldTrump I'm sorry to hear that
@charliekirk11 wow, what a stupid observation. Do I have to point out that they're cities and they're going to have democratic mayors?
@Tonybo59 @Education4Libs never exposed her daughter at all.
@jackie_sparling @Education4Libs please tell me when Avenatti said something about the president's children or grandchildren? He has not. With regards to the porn star abusing their own children by their career choice, that's your opinion. Still have to have tolerance.
@Education4Libs Michael Avenatti never targeted President's trump family. Please pay attention.
@Education4Libs hmmm, do you not care about her daughter that has nothing to do with this? would be nice if you cut the personal attacks and stuck to the facts.
@teambarbara great interview.
@dbongino I'll pass. Already listened to several lawyers that said it was well constructed.
@SenatorCollins you've been posing for all these nice, touching pictures....now why don't you put this niceness on hold and help us get rid of Trump?
@CLFirehorse @MichaelAvenatti good luck with that. Let's work on the big, deluded doofus and then see where everyone else falls
@realDonaldTrump hmm all these tweets make me think you're pissing your pants right now
@dbongino Dan, each week we're getting closer to finding collusion and you keep on saying 'it didn't happen.' A better question is what would you do if Donald Trump shat on your dog?
@Jim_Jordan this is obstruction. Please stop doing this so we can get to the bottom of this and then move on.
@digidana @dbongino Trump is most definitely a subject
@digidana @dbongino I'll ignore the clinton reference because it has nothing to do with the question...ok so if it's verified that Trump colluded, you want him removed. We'll wait for the evidence and if he's guilty we'll both tweet for his impeachment. If he's innocent, we tell haters to shut up.
@digidana @dbongino at minute 54, he's discussing the CIA getting involved with Iran and Afghanistan. not anything about the Clintons. This guy clearly has an agenda behind the info he's providing so I'll let it go at that.
@varina24751201 @Doranimated why don't you provide some evidence instead of saying things are not true? I'd love to look at it. Also please enlighten me who Adams is. In the meantime here's the wikipedia article about the dossier.  	 	https://t.co/DXUxfVUdkM
@digidana @dbongino wow this conversation is all over the place but I'll play along; please provide evidence that Mueller and Comey have been in 'their back pockets for 30 years.' Think you're making that up.  Another note would you want a president that is guilty of collusion (illegal or not)?
@realDonaldTrump Mr. Conman, why don't you shutup so the pros can finish their investigation  in peace.
@BumgardnerShaun @dbongino None of what I just listed convinces me that Trump is being Reagonesque with Russia-such as starting an arms race or Obama and Co. restricting energy sales by Rosneft and Novatek, which practically bankrupted Russia. The devil is in the details.
@BumgardnerShaun @dbongino with regards to sanctions, they hardly hurt the Russian economy so Putin can stomach this. We sold Ukraine 47mm worth of weapons, many of them most likely restricted to the back lines. Our military did increase by 15%-I'll give you that but this has nothing to do with Russia.
@BumgardnerShaun @dbongino you did changed the subject but I'll accommodate with a couple of tweets. for starters I did not say collusion so please don't put words in my mouth. I want this investigation completed due to all the weird things being exposed.
@EdKrassen after Trump gets exposed they're going to look like the biggest dumbas_es	for working with him
@SenatorCollins Senator Collins, it's time to stop toeing the line and start moving against the president. Supposedly you're independent but you've shown a tendency to buckle under pressure. Hopefully you'll vote against the SCOTUS nominee and acknowledge that Trump might be compromised
@BumgardnerShaun @dbongino when the dossier came out Steele said 'his raw and unverified reports might not be true,' but Mr. Bongino has not acknowledged that things have changed with time. Here is an article to help you better understand details	https://t.co/FXtHOrnzaw
@dbongino the first point is wrong....some of the information was unverified but not all of it. Don't understand why the other two points matter. Verification of information will always have an infancy and perhaps one investigation will says 'there's no there, there.'
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump that's a effed up comment. you have no evidence that Obama was a traitor.
@realDonaldTrump hey conman, again you're obstructing this investigation. we all deserve to hear the facts.
@realDonaldTrump @PeteHegseth @FoxNews my humble opinion tweets like these obstruct justice. Please stop so we can get to the bottom of this.
@dbongino what the f are you talking about!!!!! Why don't you come down from space?
@drmom47 no they have quite a bit. Please google and see that much of this dossier is legitimate or you can click on the article I posted below.
@digidana @dbongino ok well there's a lot of evidence that disputes what he's saying. Intelligent people can/do believe different than what he believes.
@GSDAlpha @Doranimated did you read the short article you posted? The first sentence says 'a sensational charge ...is unverified.' It is agreed among experts that much of dossier is not verified.  Below is a more complete article discussing some of things verified.	https://t.co/FXtHOrnzaw
@varina24751201 @Doranimated not true. some information has been verified. Page met with Rosneft officials, Russia had a campaign to target young and swing voters, Trump had relations with an Azeri businessman. It was first funded by a conservative group and then the Clinton Campaign.
@GSDAlpha @Doranimated Comey referred to PARTS of the dossier as 'salacious and unverified.'  Other parts have been verified including Russia using cyber methods to influence youth and swing voters, connections between Trump and an Azeri Businessman, and of course Page met with Rosneft officials
@varina24751201 @Doranimated please continue. why does the Steele dossier lack OVERALL legitimacy?
@dbongino I'm sure Chis Hahn makes the smarter points but you always seem to be the louder person. Seen this act several times.
@Doranimated actually many investigators think the Steele dossier is legitimate. It's also my humble opinion that much of it is true. (I did make it through high school and even further, no drug addictions, felonies and I'm not joking.)
@dbongino hmmm....the investigation is ongoing but you seem to dismiss it (without citing evidence). Perhaps you can cite a little more detail that supports your conclusion instead of saying it's not true and belittling people that think it might be true
@Efficient_Trade @IResistAsWell @rocaramirez @realDonaldTrump Jason, that's got to be the most effed up comment I've read in awhile. God willing a few Mexican pigeons will fly over the border just to defecate on you.
@rocaramirez @realDonaldTrump what a dumb, ignorant comment
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump wow what a grade a ahole you are
@realDonaldTrump I'm very excited to hear Michael Cohen's tapes.
@RealJack This is for the school board and not for any state or federal election and therefore has no impact on the integrity of our major elections. What a weak example to exploit democrat hypocrisy. If only the people that liked this realized what the hell you're talking about.
@realDonaldTrump you're sort of missing the point: you did not confront Putin about anything for obvious trangressions
@lisamurkowski you sound so caring...why don't you actually you something caring and not give Kavanaugh nomination a thought?
@MichaelAvenatti @GStephanopoulos @ThisWeekABC good and you will not be with Sam Nunberg hopefully....(that was ridiculous)
@FoxNews @RepDeSantis Rep Desantis, you're full of crap. Trump has approved small arm sales to the Ukraine, which will not drive out the separatists. The huge weapons that would actually make a difference have not been sold to The Ukraine
Why the hell was that Nunberg guy on with you? Don't want to see that doofus take up your time
@rewilson80 @JackPosobiec no, don't think Hollywood is filled with pedophiles more than other industries though debating something with so much room for interpretation is fruitless. Back to the point: if Trump did something grossly illegal he needs to go. Citing other people's f_ck ups has no relevance.
@realDonaldTrump Actually I think you did quite a bit wrong and am very excited to hear more of your tapes with Mr. Cohen to hear first hand all the wrong things you did
@JacobAWohl are you not paying attention? she worked for Roger Stone for 10 years.
@ArchieNot @rex_rexchapman congratulations on being quite the dick for bringing up something that had nothing to do with his comment. Why don't you give us your name, phone numbers of people that don't like you and we can share all of your stupid moments in life (for no real reason.)
@JustinJayJasper @rex_rexchapman you're technically right (or almost)....he trashed American intelligence instead of confronting Putin with all the texts and emails that he was given two weeks before the election. Of course this slight generalization makes Red 'a dumbass.'
@Education4Libs haven't seen any borders secured even though he was offered a deal. Spending has gone up on the military though I doubt you'd know where it was allocated, US energy independence was already established and it looks like Trump is riding an economy that was started under Obama.
@Education4Libs no it's more complicated than that. Would recommend you read a few books to uncover some of core beliefs.
@Education4Libs love your rhetoric you refer democrats with MS-13, illegal aliens, pedophiles and hope it sticks and unfortunately it does with a lot of your minions. it's as if you're repeating our president
@Education4Libs well yeah, we're very interested to see if Trump is compromised by Russia
@Education4Libs you listed two things are not true. Hilary did not sell 20% of uranium to Russia. She approved a deal for a company that was bought by a Russian company. The guy in question did not donate 400mm to Hilary or anybody else. You got that specific fact from Putin.
@dbongino please educate us when did Brennan lie?
@Tomvegas1 what? This tweet makes no sense.
@StidhamBrian @Education4Libs not really. Not making ridiculous generalizations and insults to rile people up over the internet. That's what trolling is.
@FoxNews Giulliani's full of crap
@JackPosobiec wow you have no excuse for the president so you do a straw man on us. The media did not cover up for Peter Fonda or Harvey Weinstein.
any comments on this conversation between you and Michael Cohen?
@Education4Libs wow you're a real troll who simplifies a lot of issues.
@Tomvegas1 is true. we don't have much right now though I got some self respect that I didn't fall for his con act
@Surabees @kimguilfoyle @DonaldJTrumpJr hmmmm. I sort of think she's a bimbo
@RealJack I'm sure you're embellish or saying something that's completely not true
@Education4Libs if we 'walk away' then we'd give up on our hope to impeach trump....
@NellSco @POTUS I like that idea though I prefer referring Donald Trump as Putin's Bitch
@GovMikeHuckabee wow you're making a joke of this when this is fairly serious.
@Russ217 @MeghanMcCain She's right Meghan. You can degrade the president's comment all you want but not until you and people in your party start suggesting impeachment we can't go anywhere. Sensible people despite their difference have to fight this together.
@JacobAWohl that is crap and you know it....you got a big platform and make an impression on a lot of followers, which is unfortunate
@RightlyNews @JesseBWatters hey jesse waters what a poser you are....deflating the threat of climate change by comparing it to terrorism.
@DarrellIssa @realDonaldTrump he just might've agreed to reduce nato expansion and cut down on joint country military exercises. why don't we learn what trump and putin's meeting was all about before you speak? Stop being partisan. Your party's spin could really threaten this country's security
@JacobAWohl oh really but you tweet all this support for the president? please justify your support for him
@BillKristol @HurdOnTheHill no manipulation in this case...trump's been compromised. just waiting for the evidence.
@SenBobCorker thanks for talking a big game then falling in line afterward. you're as independent as a line of ducks
@Rissa60 @Education4Libs are you effin' with me? he was the president of the US. He can easily get several hundred thousand for a speech. Any bank will loan 8mm to Obama. He'll more than cover the mortgage.
@SenatorIsakson how about voting 98-0 to impeach? that would be a little more effective
@JeffFlake Jeff hopefully you'll speak out more because this president seems dirty
@menks101 @LizMair @DevinNunes agreed!!! don't want to enjoy our success with this doofus
@FoxNews @newtgingrich crap (by any standard)
@MichaelAvenatti agreed though we also need someone that knows policy...cannot have someone that learns on the job (like the doofus in office)
@Yenmor @senorrinhatch @KyleKashuv yeah you're right it's been a year...Orin Hatch and ALL colleagues need to comment on this
@EdKrassen seems that way
@laughatitall7 @senorrinhatch @KyleKashuv the media retrieves information that's given to them and reports it. that's what it does...with regards to this lie, it does not bother you that Trump knew all along that Russia was involved with the election and has been misleading his base (presumably you)?
@laughatitall7 @senorrinhatch @KyleKashuv wow you keep on getting off subject. Trump was briefed on Russian interference and kept on denying it for several months. He lied to you.
@senorrinhatch @KyleKashuv thanks for spelling my name wrong...you don't get off that easily. you're not commenting on Trump KNOWING that Russia interfered with election but PURPOSELY denying it for several months. you need to confront this before commenting on anything else.
@JacobAWohl after the big Trump story tonight, you're sharing this crap with us. you got to be effing with us
@laughatitall7 @senorrinhatch @KyleKashuv you're off subject. please refer to the fact that Trump was BRIEFED with EVIDENCE that Russia hacked our election and Trump has been purposely misleading us (especially his supporters)
@LiaS814 @senorrinhatch @KyleKashuv no I'm a real person, sitting in a room in Quincy Ma. It's time for the Republican senate to confront the president on his misinformation. And it's time for his supporters (including you) to acknowledge that he's lying to you
@senorrinhatch @KyleKashuv hey senator that's a nice story but you got to comment on the new Russia story before you make any other remarks
@dbongino no this is a serious investigation that we have to get to the bottom of. as a public figure you should shut up and let the pros do their job
@realDonaldTrump no I hate the fact that Putin is blackmailing you
@Education4Libs @realTylerZed thank you...and I'm sure your book  contains more than 100 lies and misguided facts about Democrats
@realDonaldTrump hey conman, why don't you spin a lie about you getting briefed with indisputable info that Russia hacked the election two weeks before the inauguration. Can't wait to see what the BS that comes out of your mouth
@Education4Libs I am impressed by the BS you can spew in one day. Putin made that story up and it got refuted quickly.
@bbond0073 @Education4Libs so you're saying Nancy Pelosi using her platform to advocate for DACA recipients is an example of putting illegal immigrants and MS-13 ahead of taxpayers? That's a stretch at best. Please back up this reasoning.
@senrobportman Senator Portman, you spoke out against Trump's conference. If you want to insure that Trump doesn't usurp power grow some balls and reject this nomination
@bbond0073 @Education4Libs let's stick to the topic on hand; Please provide evidence that 'liberal leaders' put illegal immigrants and MS-13 ahead of taxpayers.
@Education4Libs wow you said things that are patently untrue. Liberals do not put illegal aliens or MS -13 before taxpayers. That is nonsense. Please don't put words in our mouths.
@realDonaldTrump yeah. I'm one of those people that hate that you were a p_ssy when engaging putin
@realDonaldTrump and guess what? you had nothing to do with it!!!!
@kimguilfoyle @DonaldJTrumpJr wow you guys look skanky together
@BetoORourke maybe but will Will Hurd vote to impeach trump for the good of the country?
@IngrahamAngle @Slate @FutureTenseNow wow now you're grasping at straws just so you can help your side stay in power...
@elianayjohnson thanks for reminding me that there are at least 4mm idiots in this country
@JudgeJeanine @seanhannity to hear your insightful analyses on the law...what a fuc_in' treat that it #ImpeachTrump
@IngrahamAngle @TuckerCarlson @realDonaldTrump except for the fact that you're supporting a traitor #ImpeachTrump
@tedcruz @BetoORourke @realDonaldTrump it works for me. vote Beto O Rourke
@IngrahamAngle @JohnBrennan @mikebarnicle @realDonaldTrump you gotta be effin' with us!!!! do you not have ears!!! Donald Trump said he didn't believe our intelligence!! What planet are you on?
@IngrahamAngle @carlbernstein @realDonaldTrump @CNN actually agree with him and you're a rogue commentator that only says negative things towards people that you don't agree with
@KeithRothfus oh shut up Keith. We'll see in a couple of years if this was a good plan (it's probably another reckless idea)
@mcdncn more ambiguous bullsh_t to confuse all of us
@funder yeah hopefully this weasel will talk
@SenSchumer not sure if I want to hear too much from you. You have done nothing to put up an all out resistance to this doofus and now he's about to have a stranglehold on the country. Show us that you can stop this godd_mn supreme court nominee or something to get us over this mess!!!
@SenCarlLevin so you're saying you have no confidence in your Republican colleagues in getting rid of him? Maybe but it's time to pressure our politicians to do something and to at least stand up to this nut.
@GOPSenFinance why don't you take action now? no more godd_mn ifffffffs!!!!!
@joncoopertweets @funder @MichaelAvenatti keep it up....it's unfortunate that you're the only one doing something but hopefully the dems will wake up and join you soon
@realDonaldTrump hey got a new great nickname for you. how about president troll though I think I like president p_ssy better. What do you think?
@realDonaldTrump Oh what a fu__in, you're still spouting ambiguous bullsh_t just to throw us off
@senrobportman agreed and the first/only way to do that is get rid of trump
@SenBobCorker ok please put your money where your mouth. First thing reject this supreme court candidate so he can't consolidate power
@DarrellIssa @realDonaldTrump oh wow after the president admits that he's a traitor to the whole world a right wing congressman has to do some trolling to distract us from the crap we just witnessed...what an 'effin' surpise.
@MichaelJasonCh2 @PattyMurray ok. let's have a discussion. what would trump have to do for you not to support him anymore?
@LindseyGrahamSC do you not see the god_amn tea leaves!!!! Your president just said traitorous things and damned American intelligence. It's more than our president making an error. All roads point to collusion. No direct evident but doesn't mean your pack can't get him the hell out.
@SethAbramson but Trump is most likely guilty of treason. Seth please call a spade a spade
@MichaelAvenatti finally a celebrity saying what Mr. Trump is: guilty of treason
@PattyMurray stop uttering your disgust. he's done disgusting things before.....it's time for you guys to actually act and stop him from utilizing his power. this is not a partisan thing.
@IvankaTrump we also need to get rid of your father
@PressSec @POTUS @realDonaldTrump which lies will you spin for your treasonous boss?
@SteveSchmidtSES please spare us the rant....president is compromised
@IngrahamAngle oh wow even you are criticizing the president....would've been nice to do it before he usurped all this power
@newtgingrich oh wow. now you're speaking up, you old groupie.
@SenatorCarper I agree. Let's stop complaining and get rid of the old doofus
@GreggJarrett @washingtonpost Mr. Hannity, your ridiculousness never seizes to amaze me. You just quoted someone that wrote 'The Russian Hoax.' You'll do anything for conservatives to maintain power and not advocate what is right for the country.
@senrobportman wow you sound really convincing....why don't you actually do something like rally against him...help us get him out. take off your partisan glasses!!!!
@realDonaldTrump please help pick the best nickname? President Conman? Donald the Traitor? or my new favorite? President P_ssy?
@realDonaldTrump Can you please answer me 1 question: What's it's like to be certified p_ssy?
@maziehirono nice sound bite now do something
@maziehirono @realDonaldTrump no arguments...now do something please
@SenJeffMerkley he's very compromised. all roads lead to Rome.
@SenWhitehouse ok stop complaining and do something!!!! we voted you in to act in our interests. This presidents needs to be stopped.
@SenJackReed please call it for what it is....he's a traitor and both sides of the aisle have to do something or else we're effed.
@marcorubio then fight against the president because he obviously is not going to stand up to PUTIN. You can always block his judicial nominee and you can always suggest impeachment
@seanhannity wow, hannity, you got to be effin' with me
@RyanFCharles @JeffFlake yeah stop being a doofus and stand up and do something. Our godd_m democracy depends on you republicans to grow a backbone!!!!
@realDonaldTrump President traitor, got another question: when if/you do usurp power over law enforcement, will you jail a little liberal like me? #MakeAmericaAmericaAgain #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
@realDonaldTrump president traitor you're contradicting yourself. You're acknowledging that Russia did meddle while also dismissing the investigation by calling it a witch hunt.  Organize your thoughts please.
@realDonaldTrump not sure what's a better nickname, president conman, Donald the Traitor, Traitor Donald. Why don't you pick one?
@realDonaldTrump yeah I can't wait for you to get pushed over again by another dictator. It's going to be great
@realDonaldTrump more conman crap....'fake news' very appropriately is covering the fact that North Korea has done nothing to decrease their nuclear capabilities. Actually they've enhanced it, President Conman.
@realDonaldTrump you're right Conman, it still hurts a little when we think about it. Though we've moved on and we just want you to resolve the Russian issue by taking action.
@realDonaldTrump Hey Conman again you deflect the story. You're supposed to protect us now that you're president. Take action for f_cksakes!!!!!
@PressSec @CNN @POTUS Sarah, your heavy handed techniques never fails to amaze me.
@thoughtsinmotio @bravegirl01 @AviAhvee @PressSec @CNN @POTUS may you provide evidence that Obama did worse and in higher numbers?
@hey_bernie @WHAS11Sara @WHAS11 just learned about the 'walk away' movement. Don't you worry about me....got a clear conscience and won't become a self-fulfilling prophecy if things don't go my way. Not sure if Mitch and his like minded buddies will react the same way
@hey_bernie @WHAS11Sara @WHAS11 don't understand your comment. please elaborate
@senorrinhatch won't mess with him. No fighting or anything but we're happy to continue to remind him in very direct ways that he's perhaps the most selfish majority leader ever. (also should remind you that you have been quite awful to us little liberals that don't agree with you)
@WHAS11Sara @WHAS11 good. I'm glad he'll relish our company because we'll continue to walk alongside him and remind him how selfish he has been
@AJGullotta @brad_lombardi @SBTBH @LouMerloni ok you got a point. Saw a few articles speculating that Arizona got the 'wrong brother' though nothing was confirmed. Still think they got plenty in return and actually got the best deal offered because Dombrowski was aggressive.
@AJGullotta @brad_lombardi @SBTBH @LouMerloni please elaborate.
@AJGullotta @brad_lombardi @SBTBH @LouMerloni I also am wondering what evidence you have that the league was stunned by that deal?
@AJGullotta @brad_lombardi @SBTBH @LouMerloni and I'm saying Luis Alejandro was also a prospect (a lessor one) but ranked in the top 20 of Red Sox Prospects (#18 https://t.co/awzH7C2NSd) at the time. Jose Almonte was also considered an MLB prospect. For a rental reliever trading these two players was aggressive.
@AJGullotta @brad_lombardi @SBTBH @LouMerloni yes he was. he was having a breakout year and was in between 15-20 according to RedSox Prospects. The other guy they traded was probably not that high but he also had MLB potential
@AJGullotta @brad_lombardi @SBTBH @LouMerloni ok will  you acknowledge scouts predicted Basabe would become a top 10 Diamondbacks prospects and most likely play in the MLB? Would you not say trading a prospect like this for a rental reliever is not overpaying? No hindsight please.
@AJGullotta @brad_lombardi @SBTBH @LouMerloni Why don't you elaborate and tell me about the prospects traded for Ziegler and what the scouts were saying about them at the time? Perhaps I'm shoving my foot in the mouth but I'm guessing I'll get some dumb analyses (and maybe some simple insult.)
@SBTBH @AJGullotta @brad_lombardi @LouMerloni really, you would trade two top 20 prospects, including the best in baseball, as well as pay his huge bonus and two other prospects that had a great chances to make it to majors for Chris Sale? Trade has worked out. No argument here but most GMs would not make that trade.
@AJGullotta @brad_lombardi @SBTBH @LouMerloni that's not true when taking HINDSIGHT out of the equation: He overpaid on Sale, Kimbrel, Pomeranz, Ziegler. Admittedly these prospects are not killing it but now we have no system.
@iJokerinabox @brad_lombardi @SBTBH @LouMerloni we'll see in a couple of years where these kids end up....regardless it's a fact our system is gutted through trades that Dumbo was very anxious to make
@SenShelby where are the pictures of you and the rest of the traitor 8 when you guys went to Russia?
@brad_lombardi @SBTBH @LouMerloni yeah there's no arguing that Dumbo ruined a system that Cherington built
@realDonaldTrump What's so sad is that some people believe this BS, BS that will morally and financially bankrupt our nation. But that's not all Mr. Conman: You can get a lot of us killed before too long
@realDonaldTrump would agree with you in practice but our election unfortunately does not have selfish ego maniacal psychopaths that purposely divide the country for their own gains.
@realDonaldTrump Hey conman, let's see where we are in four years because of your dumb_ss policies and selections for the supreme court
@realDonaldTrump Hey Mr. Conman Don, the investigation (not witch hunt) was never run by Peter S. That is a lie.	Instead of looking into the non stories they just listed they want to see why Deutshe Bank lent you all that money when you had no credit
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump cool, Jacob Wohl, I see you've been CONNED by the conman. Please tell me how awesome it is to be so gullible
@realDonaldTrump Hmmmmm....cannot see this report anywhere on the internet. I think you might have lied to us again. What a fuc_in' surprise.
@realDonaldTrump fingers crossed no one's giving what you say any credence. Want to know why? Becuase you're a conman!!!!!!!!!!!
@realDonaldTrump yeah you're the biggest witch they can get though you put some yellowish sh_t on your face to cover up those witch wrinkles
@blake_actual @andrewlong166 @HackswithHaggs agree that Karlsson is better offensively, best puck handling skills for a dman I've seen since Niedemayer. Still when Z was 25-26, he was a shutdown d-man and that did not change until a couple of years ago. Karllson is great, Z is elite (top 5 d-men of all time)
@blake_actual @andrewlong166 @HackswithHaggs Karlsson is a great two way defenseman. Is not the player that Chara was at 29.
@realDonaldTrump You're lying again. What a surprise, Mr. Donald Con Artist Trump.
@DanaPerino wow, aren't you a genius...calling it after all the analysts and their mothers had been 'calling' it all year.
@realDonaldTrump hey con artist, I've heard crazier from you
@TonyMassarotti you gotta be kidding....you're saying Ovechkin is more of a winner than Durant? Have you watched all those Capital teams choke when they were absolutely loaded.
@JonHeyman I've always said Lebron was at another level than most of the greats: Bird, Majic, Kobe, Shaq but you gotta be effing with us right now. Jordan's teams would not have lost to the spurs or maveriks
@realDonaldTrump @NavalAcademy you're full of crap. You couldn't care less about those people. You're just there to look commendable. You're still a grade a self promoting con artist.
@realDonaldTrump you're still a conman. Unfortunately so many people believe your BS.
@realDonaldTrump you're a con artist. that's all you are.
@realDonaldTrump you're such the goddamn con-artist....you got the world all hopeful and increased approval rating when you knew that peace was impossible...hope you go away
@realDonaldTrump You're a goddam con artist. You self promote bs and do not a goddamn thing for us #conartist
@tomhanks great to see another fan cheering on the villa. In September there's an Aston Villa meetup where supporters get together in New York on the weekend of the 14th. You should come!!!!!
@MikeSabovik are you around to come to the finals at Parlor Sports in Inman Square?
Aston Villans Supporters in Boston, we're showing the game at the Parlor Sports Bar at 1 Beacon St. Somerville, in Inman Square. Let's try to have a great showing as we hopefully get to the Premier League, where we belong. #Aston Villa, #Aston Villa America, Boston Villains
@MichaelAvenatti please continue to do your job
@seanhannity Good luck deciphering between the teens that say they feel violent and the ones that actually will shoot up schools. Every school has 'red flags'
Hey Aston Villans living in the Boston Area. We are getting together to watch the game at The Rising: 1172 Cambridge St. Cambridge, Ma. #Aston @Boston_Villains  #Aston Villa Boston #Boston Villans
@summitquikstang @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump What planet are you on? Flynn indicted, Manafort indicted, uncovering the meeting in the trump tower, Kushner opening up a line of communication with Russians, Trump withdrawing sanctions, all issues that require further investigation
@TonyMassarotti Why are you doing this troll crap? We've seen the players he's turned into multi, mutil-millionaires, Crowder, Thomas, Zeller, Olynyk, Turner, etc. Now we're watching Tatum turn into a superstar
@TonyMassarotti tony, you paying attention to this team? we've got a much more athletic team than the cavs...it will be very hard for the cavs to match this pace
@TonyMassarotti this cannot be true....another dumbassbrowski move!!!
@marcorubio why not provide tax credit to companies that invest in working class people instead of actually just giving them a tax cut and trusting them that they'll use it to invest in our workforce?
@AlbertBreer please don't exaggerate things he's good enough to play pro somewhere-maybe not the nba
@AnnaHorford I agree. That was an d_ck move by Gronk
@Curry_Edition @AnnaHorford got a point about the biased reffing. Was not good tonight...But Al played a great game. Are you paying attention?
Couldn't help it...line of the week. Must retweet. https://t.co/RHdr2ta0Mi
@bomani_jones wow you're a douche....keep on tweeting irrelevant things and pretend that you actually have a strong voice
@angry_guy_rant @KenLairdWEEI @SVcallahan22 @kirkmin so true. Minihane building a band of minions. Ken Laird, Mut, Christian Arcand, Bradford and pushing actual talent out: Tanguay, Reimer, Etc
@Bradfo_Sho @bradfo @AlexReimer1 @WEEI @_ChrisCurtis you're the dumbass though, you're wasting talent and continuing with hacks like Mut or Tanguay.
@KenLairdWEEI @kirkmin Though his son's much more talented than you. Stupid for the show to continue with hacks like you. Rather listen to Salk than you.
@AlexVandengo @MJ_Begin @DanLifshatz Doofus, he was right and you're still giving him crap. You're piece of work.
@CrisNatali2 @sean_spicier didn't notice the manipulation of the word 'spicier.' Indeed I was 'spiced'
@sean_spicier more interested in hearing whether your boss thinks climate change is a hoax. (Actually is much more important also)
@JackPosobiec Shut up Jack, Maher was CLEARLY making a joke. Don't misrepresent it because you don't like the guy.
@TFrei You said something that wasn't accepted in a politically correct charged environment. Not fair that they took your job for that.
Loved your essay. Great to see you call out an over ambitious writer. https://t.co/bQIszf24eS
@nickcafardo Farrell does not warrant manager of year consideration. Completely inept game caller.
Jessica @jessmendoza thought you had promise but you're saying very little and when you do say something it's fairly simple
RT @LKrauss1: Trump, to Khizr Khan, on sacrifice: "I've made a lot of sacrifices..I've created thousands..of jobs. I've had tremendous succ…
@US_Soccer_Fan1 Hey checking in with you. You came to the Banshee a couple of years ago. If you're around please come for the final game.
@SHFTGregJ60 she's not that bad. Had a bad game Sunday night but the week before she was making good insights.
@GlobeChadFinn Not a bad point. John Kruk was anemic. Jessica has potential but she needs a lot of work. Wish ESPN put her in lessor role.
@Ethan_Booker That's absolute crap. Doris Burke is great at her job. Jessica Mendoza needs a lot of work! She misses a lot of insights.
@thebiglead Think you're exaggerating. How 'bout Joe Morgan? Hawk Harrelson? Bob Ueker? Steve Stone?
@BenFinfer do you really? Too many missed calls for me. The hitting analyses is coming along but the pitching analyses has to get better.
@DPPJ spare me the pointless comment. Kid thought Amy wouldn't be offended but she was. Kid apologized for it.You should shut up.
Beaulieu should've been suspensed. NHL messed up.
@Jim_Wiggenhorn Mr. Wiggenhorn had you at fenn school in 1989 before you left...always wanted to let you know that you were a douche
@georgediaz you referring to the interview where you were completely unprepared? Know the facts next time.
