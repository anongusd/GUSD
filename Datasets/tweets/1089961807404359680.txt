@mrkarden It's not something I believe to be true, it is true. Literally what part of modernity wasn't created by White people? But to answer your question, it's a case of the non sequitur fallacy.

@JackPosobiec @joerogan @joerogan should moderate every presidential debate, while high
@mrkarden I don't mean anything by it. I just want to expose it as a fact that White supremacists cite fallaciously to support their dumb theories. In a hypothetical argument, it's like, oh, so you think because Whites invented the best stuff it means Whites are the best? Uh, wrong.
@KenDilanianNBC I think he also drank water, just like Hitler
@MyDogNose @DonaldJTrumpJr What the fuck
@mrkarden Modern science, yeah. I don't know why you're so hesitant to accept this lol
@mrkarden By conceding that White people created modern technology and science? That's not a belief, it's a fact.
@BirnbaumMatt @hughhewitt @realDonaldTrump Then you didn't even read the statute you cited lol
@BirnbaumMatt @hughhewitt @realDonaldTrump Yeah, nothing in there about gun control. If the Secretary declared gun violence a national emergency then they would be buying bulletproof vests for people lmao
@QA_NJ @newrepublic A bunch of morons fell for the Steele dossier
@mrkarden I don't really know what to make of these facts, but I know they absolutely do not imply Whites are superior. That's the one conclusion that's impossible to reach, but we need some persuasive explanation if we're going to stem the rising tide of White supremacy
@BirnbaumMatt @hughhewitt @realDonaldTrump Under 10 U.S.C. ¬ß 284(b)(7), the United States military may construct ‚Äúfences and road‚Ä¶ to block drug smuggling corridors across international boundaries of the United States‚Äù upon request from the responsible agency. 		Is there any statutory authority for your dumb ideas?
@mrkarden No. No. Because it's a fact, and it reinforces no narrative inherently. Facts just are. 		The narrative is up to you and it's really easy to think Whites are superior with these facts. Even you seem to agree with that. It makes sense superficially, but it's ultimately wrong.
@mrkarden What bullshit? Do you think Whites *didn't* invent all the examples I listed?		Those are just facts. It's how you interpret the facts that matters and White supremacists misinterpret them.
@mrkarden üòÇ		Anyway, all I wanted to demonstrate is that just because Whites invented basically every aspect of modernity doesn't mean they're the superior race. I just wish White supremacists could understand this simple concept.
@mrkarden Pretty sure they did. Whites created the automobile, the computer, quantum physics, the internet, the industrial revolution, biology, the big bang, refrigeration, the semiconductor. Literally what haven't they discovered?
@mrkarden Exactly, and that's why even though Whites have founded the pinnacle of modern civilization, medicine, technology, science, that doesn't mean they're superior. I wouldn't call the present day the "White golden age" nor the past the "Islamic golden age."
@mrkarden The "Muslims" of the "Islamic golden age" were converted under the sword and their scholarship was just a continuation of the Greeks, Persians, Christians and Indians. They literally called Aristotle "the first teacher." 		And Byzantium was still thriving in the "dark ages."
@mrkarden It can sound that way, but you understand the argument I'm making, right?
@mrkarden The golden age of Islam and the dark ages are both myths.
@mrkarden I was talking present day. Everybody wants to live in Scandinavia and Germany, which are the Whitest places on earth and global centers of technological innovation, but that doesn't mean Scandinavians and Germans are inherently superior just because they make the best stuff.
@drvox Who said what about political violence?
@mrkarden Yes
@mrkarden How is it not?
@ClandestineRos1 But we're approaching, or have already reached, a point where both sides believe the other side is a fifth column trying to subvert the Republic.
@eugenegu HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHA		What cost have you paid for "speaking out"?
@KurtSchlichter Don't give them such a hard time. They just see that all the best places to live and technologies were built by White people and they extrapolate that to mean Whites are superior, but that's not what it means.

@Vonnegutterball To get put into a gulag you were the first to stop clapping for Stalin. To be put into an immigration detention center you illegally entered the country. No comparison.
@Vonnegutterball Gulags and concentration camps were objectively worse, yes, by far.
@Vonnegutterball I dunno fam, the resemblance between concentration camps and gulags is downright uncanny
@Vonnegutterball Just like everywhere else. Fascism and socialism elevated human destruction to an industrial level.
@Vonnegutterball It's because you're just bending over backwards to deny that fascism and socialism are fruits of the same tree.
@Vonnegutterball It's a bug in our system. It's a feature in socialism/fascism.
@Vonnegutterball Gulags and concentration camps are basically the same.
@Vonnegutterball Socialists argue they're freeing people too. Of course, they aren't.
@Vonnegutterball The point is socialists today, like fascists then, believe that the more complex civilization becomes the more restricted individual freedom must be. That's it.
@lettucewrangler The quote by itself, on its own, without context, says nothing about crushing socialism.
@Vonnegutterball @RespectableLaw @JohnCornyn That particular quote, posted on its own without context, isn't critical of socialism. It's the way Cornyn employs the quote that's critical of socialism, by associating it with Mussolini and fascism.

@ACorollaries How did they get so much power? Lobbying government. Smaller government means less power for sale. Re: worker leverage, it's all about supply and demand. More workers = less wages/power. That's why I oppose immigration, especially low skilled, those jobs will be obsolete soon.
@ACorollaries I agree with that, but I think the best way to realize the incredible productive potential of technology is through minimally regulated free markets. Government always favors the rich. The future is worker collectives and communes if government gets the hell out of our way.

@johnastoehr @BuckSexton Even more disgusting is how the media perpetrated a hoax on the American people calling our President a Russian agent.
@BradMossEsq @RadioFreeTom @BuckSexton Manafort isn't the campaign. And if getting oppo research from foreign governments is a crime then the DNC/Hillary is guilty of that too (Chalupa, Leshchenko).

@Asneakypete @atrupar Remember the Strzok-Page text that said "POTUS wants to know everything we're doing"?		Makes as much sense as the Trump-Russia conspiracy theory, but as long as you acknowledge we're both wearing tin foil hats I'm happy.
@Asneakypete @atrupar The investigation started during the Obama administration as revenge for the "birther" stuff.
@atrupar Is there something wrong with calling for an investigation into your political opponents? That's how the entire Trump-Russia conspiracy theory got going.
@maxersmom01 @HoarseWisperer It is an emergency. Trump declared it's an emergency and he's President, so what he says goes.
@Sea_2Lake @HoarseWisperer Yeah, it is. Our level of emergency has only increased by 1 in 32, so you can hardly notice it.

@downeyballs @trump_troll_16 @ChuckRossDC There's no precedent for information being considered a "thing of value," but whatever. If you want to go that route, then it was illegal when the DNC got oppo research from Ukrainian embassy officials through Alexandra Chalupa.
@downeyballs @trump_troll_16 @ChuckRossDC You're not a doctor, so I need to see you cite the specific statute that was violated.
@trump_troll_16 @downeyballs @ChuckRossDC Because they got bamboozled thinking they were going to get dirt on Hillary, but they got lobbied instead.
@downeyballs @trump_troll_16 @ChuckRossDC What law does accepting the offer break?		*begins popping popcorn*
@TippeTyYay @JoscoJVTeam @nchaseteeples @ChuckRossDC Well, yeah, Trump is a real estate developer. That's not unusual. And Manafort isn't alleged to have given the docs to Russian oligarchs.
@trump_troll_16 @downeyballs @ChuckRossDC So as to not embarrass themselves.
@downeyballs @trump_troll_16 @ChuckRossDC Yeah, a lobbyist lied about having dirt on Hillary to get a meeting with Trump Jr. and then lobbied against the Magnitsky Act. Accepting the offer of opposition research isn't illegal. And just because someone lobbies you doesn't mean you're accepting bribes.
@downeyballs @trump_troll_16 @ChuckRossDC Except he wasn't, so... üíÅ		Unless you have evidence he was, in which case I would love to see it.
@downeyballs @trump_troll_16 @ChuckRossDC The "actual story" is a lobbyist being paid for lobbying. It's a nothingburger.

@piccolohl @KyleKulinski I haven't seen any indication that that's the specific comment they want to sue him for. They probably are trying to scare some folks into apologizing though, which I don't think is that bad considering how the kids were treated. They definitely deserve an apology.
@LauraGelezunas üëç		Have a great day!
@Delavegalaw Would Mueller allow a Russian agent to be POTUS? If he had a smoking gun, would he be obligated to hand it off to Congress for impeachment?
@LauraGelezunas It's tough to say, but you should definitely watch the video they put out.
@LauraGelezunas Here's a video the kids' lawyers put out. Mr. Phillips instigated the whole thing and consistently lied about it. I don't fault the kid for standing his ground against a bully trying to intimidate him.		 https://t.co/nDWExMoPOF
@LauraGelezunas Yeah, I'm not lawyer, but I do think these kids' reputations were damaged and lives were threatened as a result of faulty media coverage. I don't know if they actually have a case though.
@rescuemomoffive @SamuelScript @ChuckRossDC I'm not seeing a connection to Hillary or the DNC in this specific instance.
@nchaseteeples @ChuckRossDC A lobbyist was paid for lobbying. I don't understand how this is a "bombshell" report. Seems like another dud.
@LauraGelezunas The National Enquirer is garbage. I would recommend going to @Barnes_Law for the particular tweets. He's representing, or has offered to represent, the Covington kids.

@LauraGelezunas I didn't read the article. I was just going off of what I read on the Twitter.
@SamuelScript @rescuemomoffive @ChuckRossDC Is it a bombshell because he lobbied Trump Jr. et al? Because he didn't register under FARA?
@SamuelScript @rescuemomoffive @ChuckRossDC How is a lobbyist being paid to lobby a bombshell?
