@yashar I loved the movie The Namesake, which showed an amazing and subtle beauty describing just this.
The full thread that inspired this thread is in a moment, since it got truncated: https://t.co/NJZJJtDjxo
About struggling with ADHD or whatever this is that leave me paralyzed and unable to do the things I say I want to do. https://t.co/Fcv2z07v3r
I know how hard this is, and I know others who don't struggle with this, so they don't understand &amp; judge me.		That's not helpful.		I judge myself much more harshly that anyone ever will. Imagine the pile on that's created when you chime in w/what I'm already doing to myself. /13
I need to stop paying attention to what I perceive will be the pain (emotional/physical) that I'm letting get in the way of getting stuff done.		Look, I'm SHOULDing myself again. /12
What this effectively means is I've performed these tasks millions of times without actually making any progress whatsoever. That means I'm feeling all the effort, without the actual results. I'm desperate for results. I need to 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 more often and just DO THE THING. /11
There are thousands (no exaggeration) of things around me that need to be done and I will have thought through the process of doing each one dozens to hundreds to thousands of times before I actually do any of it. /10
I tend to overthink things. Thinking is not doing, but it does require energy and can be exhausting.		Doing actually requires less energy. Again, back to the 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 on things like housework.		I'm talking myself into this while I'm typing. /9
The word decision means "to cut" - you cut yourself off from other things when you decide. Part of my paralysis is wanting to keep options open. I use @MelRobbins's 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 method sometimes just to get me going when I'm paralyzed. /8
But I often cannot go back and find the thing I need to find anyway because I'm buried under a pile of tabs.		This is the same when I start a project. I must buy all the things - every supply - before I can get started.		I believe this is based in a fear of making decisions. /7
In my electronic life the way this manifests is hundreds and hundreds of browser tabs open - things I was distracted from and should just close - and things I intend to go back to. I leave them open because "out of sight = out of mind." /6
Distractions are a way of avoiding the pain of facing things that are too overwhelming. I can feel almost a physical pull away from something I know I SHOULD do. SHOULDs can feel extremely overwhelming and uncomfortable. /5
And the pain I can inflict on myself is at almost intolerable levels already. In my later years I've learned not to be so hard on myself, simply to survive. It's a numbness and paralyzation that others can't understand, but it's how I get through the day. /4
I could do so much more if I could break out of this cycle. At least that's what I tell myself.		Getting help to break the pattern doesn't actually help, often. Usually the helpers will shame me in ways they don't even realize. /3
If I can't do it perfectly I'm overwhelmed and can't do anything at all. But the endless distractions - when I'm trying to tackle problems that seem out of control or too big to handle - leads me to just give up. And that can lead to depression. /2
I have never been diagnosed with ADD/ADHD, but this is a pretty accurate description of how my life feels - especially the spiral that can happen when one thing gets disorganized &amp; how it goes out of control from there. I have formerly ascribed it to perfectionism. /1 https://t.co/JjOuH2AATF

After a few days my mom gave us permission to make a haunted house and maze. We drew and painted on it. Then my mother m went to her pre-election volunteer meeting and found out those were the new voting booths. We had to get a second set delivered. /4
Voting booths were wood sticks and cloth. One year right before Halloween a pile of cardboard appeared on our porch. No note explaining what it was. Big pieces with slots, shorter pieces with tabs. We waited a few days - no one claimed it. /3
