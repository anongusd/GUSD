@USABrit4Trump @Account40171750 @steph93065 @EricHolthaus Right there is THE statement: "Adapt or die".  Humans adapt. Some species do not.
@Account40171750 @USABrit4Trump @steph93065 @EricHolthaus I have enjoyed it. Come back again soon. üñêÔ∏è
@USABrit4Trump @Account40171750 @steph93065 @EricHolthaus I have a breathing problem. I view pictures of Japan and begin to smother.
@USABrit4Trump @Account40171750 @steph93065 @EricHolthaus Interesting! I also passed over a statement that the sun is entering a "cooling stage". I will get back to that one. This might be "fixed" naturally. We can hope. Don't you love science? Once I entered college, I couldn't seem to stop. I still study it.
@Account40171750 @USABrit4Trump @steph93065 @EricHolthaus Gotcha. At least we can say Japan is far more crowded. We truly need to curb these "baby makers" from coming to the US. We can't support the mothers, much less the 5-8 kids they have on average.
@Account40171750 @USABrit4Trump @steph93065 @EricHolthaus We see more people freeze/frostbite every year and more instances of heat exhaustion in summers. Our good ole air conditioning and heating methods are adding to the emissions. It's a circle.
@Account40171750 @USABrit4Trump @steph93065 @EricHolthaus Sure do.
@USABrit4Trump @Account40171750 @steph93065 @EricHolthaus Humans are blessed with adaptibility. We will survive it.
@Account40171750 @USABrit4Trump @steph93065 @EricHolthaus And we are seeing the proliferation of diseases asscoiated with warming. Malaria is a good example. Mosquitos carrying it are "moving" due to environment changes, so the disease is moving into other areas.
@Account40171750 @USABrit4Trump @steph93065 @EricHolthaus Exactly right. We are already seeing species die off.
@USABrit4Trump @Account40171750 @steph93065 @EricHolthaus Exactly. God controls it all anyhow. And many years for these changes to affect us critically. This is why we pulled out of the Paris Accord. Not enough evidence YET to spend trillions.
@Account40171750 @USABrit4Trump @steph93065 @EricHolthaus I agree. It's been a back n forth issue for 20 yrs. Studies debunked and new ones begin.
@USABrit4Trump @Account40171750 @steph93065 @EricHolthaus There is a problem Houston. ( for the next several generations).  Studies must continue. Earth is warming very slowly at .6c last 100 yrs. but projected to increase. What to do about it is the issue. As it warms, troubles with weather, sea temps etc.
Japan is using their methods. We view the smog and they are required to wear masks when outside. I don't think it's working out too well. More to come. And our earth temp has risen .6C over the last 100 yrs.
Now I have taken up the "global warming" issue. It's going to take some reading, so stay tuned. I did find that 20,000 scientists have rejected the 1977 Study from Japan and their methods to rectify it "will harm mankind, science and technology."

@Account40171750 @USABrit4Trump @steph93065 @EricHolthaus No judgement here. And yes all the things you mention are true. We do have a problem Houston! More for after we are gone, but we have future generations to consider. More studies on the way. Thousands are working on this issue.
@Account40171750 @USABrit4Trump @steph93065 @EricHolthaus The study in Kyoto, Japan 1977 was rejected by 20,000 scientists in the US. They say "yes the earth's temp is rising slightly and will continue into the next decade." BUT the method of reducing the greenhouse gasses significantly will be detrimental to life.

Big picture #MAGA! 100 yr old coal co. closing due to Obama EPA Regs, which Trump quickly rolled back. Trump will be blamed and Dems will use it against him. Be diligent on reporting. The battle to keep him is on! 2020
@efw062365 The 1st coal plant is closing their doors after 100 yrs due to choking Regs imposed by Obama EPA. More will follow. Then fuel production and so on. Trump will be blamed. He rolled them back quickly, but the damage is done.
@efw062365 They have a lot of cash!  You know how "money talks". It depends on how fast certain of their "sins" hits the media. Slow process so far. Trump is entering a touchy financial era now with coal plants closing. Obama Regs caused it but Trump will take the heat.
@Waybeyondempty2 Schiff is the 1st step in grief: anger and denial. "We will just start our own investigation, bigger and better!"  Too funny!
