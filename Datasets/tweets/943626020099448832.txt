@fireheather @realDonaldTrump Certainly don't take him at his word , He explains the people involved and how they are all personally related to each other to get the FISA warrant on mere gossip, nothing written  through email, and they believed Hillary would get elected and no one would be the wiser.

@TheWrightJohn @realDonaldTrump I would have offered to do that for the President too, and the emails that would have been offered up would be real documents from the DNC, so factual information, not made up BS. Clinton was so irresponsible with classified info, she deserves what she got.

@fireheather @realDonaldTrump It's bias

@bonniebailey63 @ebizarch @PoliticsWhatery @robreiner Your in for a surprise buddy...
@PoliticsWhatery @ebizarch @bonniebailey63 @robreiner Attacked by the DNC and Clintons...
@PoliticsWhatery @MrsAJJones @ebizarch @bonniebailey63 @robreiner Ok?
@bonniebailey63 @ebizarch @PoliticsWhatery @robreiner You guys are all responding to me and accusing me of trolling?
@Ssmitty2929 @katelovescolor @mitchellvii Thank you!
RT @Ssmitty2929: @Kim4827 @katelovescolor @mitchellvii  https://t.co/O56WnOhxoK
@katelovescolor @mitchellvii This whole story is petty and desperate to find any morsel of wrongdoing, just like the Russian bullshit, you guys are clinging on to concocted fantasizes. Trump has no money issues, "prove intent" and does it not concern you if Hilliary's behavior's? Would you prefer that?
@katelovescolor @DubbleDave @mitchellvii Just because 19 women come forward with allegations, doesn't mean they have integrity and were not paid to convince you to hate Trump.
@katelovescolor @mitchellvii Unless you there buddy watching Stormy and Trump going at it...you don't know...
@DubbleDave @katelovescolor @mitchellvii They are alleged stories, no proof, no texts, no selfies, nothing...politics is dirty,  especially with Clintons in the arena. We are all sinners, I don't require Trump to be a Saint, I require him to restore what's been lost through Globalists agenda's.
@SDDNOLE @katelovescolor @mitchellvii Thank you!
@katelovescolor @SDDNOLE @mitchellvii How do you know she was not paid to lie by the opposition?
@katelovescolor @SDDNOLE @mitchellvii ‚ÄúIf we had to defend this as not being a campaign contribution, I think we could do that. This was for personal reasons. The president had been hurt personally, not politically, personally so much and the first lady by the false allegations,‚Äù Giuliani said.
@MrsAJJones @ebizarch @PoliticsWhatery @bonniebailey63 @robreiner Just so you know, I don't watch any news stations, but if I had to, it certainly would be Fox, have you seen their ratings...way up there...
@MrsAJJones @ebizarch @PoliticsWhatery @bonniebailey63 @robreiner Read the newspapers? Yeah that's pure non fiction and unbiasedüôÑ

@katelovescolor @SDDNOLE @mitchellvii I personally know several women who have told bold faced lies about their men in court, men have spent time is jail for a false narrative. She is of a low moral fiber and I can not give any credibility to this it is beneath me to do so. The media knows people will eat this up.
@DubbleDave @katelovescolor @mitchellvii Trump could be that man now, but the media won't let you entertain that thought.
@katelovescolor @mitchellvii Do you realize that having consensual sex with an adult is not illegal or unheard of...I would bet that the opposition paid her to spread this rumor, and then paid again from Cohen to stop spreading the lie...she could of been paid twice? After all this is war!
@SDDNOLE @katelovescolor @mitchellvii Do you realize I can not get an intellectual debate from any of you...

@katelovescolor @mitchellvii Do you understood that Stormy's only career was to manipulate men for money, that is her only career. All her relationships with men have been superficial, she is an actor! For dollars! This broad can clearly be paid to say and do anything! That is what she does...
