@SenJoniErnst Iowa is lucky to have you Ms. Ernst. Amazing speech. Partisanship is going too far!
@IdeasHave @KamalaHarris It’s for sure better than infanticide.
@KamalaHarris What about equality for babies who are born, yet their parents still want to have them removed from the world? Abortion is okay, infantcide is not. Take a look at equality and justice before you say that you advocate for It. Racial justice is a major part, there is more to it.
Hopefully the government can work together and like... do what we pay them to do? #doyourjob #YouHadOneJob

If people took a minute to look at the Record of @SenatorSinema and @SenMcSallyAZ they would know that these two are good senators. They should elect Martha McSally for the rest of McCain’s term. Kyrsten and Martha will be allies in which can disagree respectfully.

Lets come together and stop cancer!! #WorldCancerDay #Cancersucks #KillCancer
Its time to put our country first, not second like its been for a while now. As John McCain's 2008 slogan was "Country First." That is and will be true forever.
@RandPaul Preach it!!! Time for America First!
