@borninthebear @SupraBo_ @DanHCrypto Dont know about French banks but here in the states, banks are only required to maintain 10% of the total deposits on hand. The rest is loaned out, so if the # were even just 20% of the population taking part it would crash the system.

@Suzi3D @JasonJBrown1 @wikileaks @Snowden I really enjoy how you come at me, attacking me for 'having an opinion' that threatens one of your sacred cows and use at least 5 different logical fallacies and yet, supposedly you 'speak for truth'
@Suzi3D @JasonJBrown1 @wikileaks @Snowden the 'Main Stream' media however - of which regardless of your notions of what you do, you are a member of - is dying and not a moment too soon.	Q did exactly 1 thing of value so far - it motivated people to start doing their own reasearch into information &amp;Not rely on gatekeepers
@Suzi3D @JasonJBrown1 @wikileaks @Snowden awww, isn't that cute.		You 'do' realize you're irrelevant now - your 'profession' I mean.  I don't follow Q as a person, a group or an entity.		I 'follow' Q as an information sharing and news aggregation source.  The posts are fun and occasionaly on point but not the purpose.
@Suzi3D @JasonJBrown1 @wikileaks @Snowden oh no, you mistake me greatly if you think I'm attacking Julian - I am not, have not and likely never will.		But again, do continue making assumptions that fit your preconceptions.		Remember, you're the one attacking me here - or had that slipped your notice as well?
@Suzi3D @JasonJBrown1 @wikileaks @Snowden Alternately, instead of assuming you know everything about me by a twitter shit-posting account you could consider a conversation - but that ship sailed I think.		That you're even here 'defending' in the way you are also further discredits you via the cheerleader comparison.
@Suzi3D @JasonJBrown1 @wikileaks @Snowden *and then apply your bias to your interpretation.		Keep on shouting into the wind - I really don't care about your opinion or your ad hominem attacks and appeals to authority.  That you have to so quickly resort to such tactics reflects poorly on you.

#WWG1WGA 	#QAnon
#WWG1WGA 	#QAnon 	#WorldWide
The Storm is now upon us - and the Great Awakening cannot be stopped.
WE 	are Q. 	All of us.  		And where we go one, we go all.
Yellow Vests and Patriots and Proud boys.   	Black Lives Matter (the real ones, not the corp. hijacked ones) and the intellectual dark web.  	Students. 	Steel workers.  	Coal Miners.  	Software engineers.  	Lawyers.  	Law enforcement officers.  	Praying Medics n more...
Of late, that's largely what it has been - but that's ok.    		The population (WW) in no small part has woken up and begun to take real  keen interest in what their governments are doing 'on their behalf'.   	/snark  		And they have begun to take action...
Well, that is, when it's not utterly flooded with frivolous image  posters (at best) and malicious disinformation agents (at worst).
A massive human information aggregation system.
That's what 8chan and the QResearch board is.  		A hivemind of researchers  and curios information seekers from all walks of life.  Thousands of  people coming together to share snippets here, experience there.   Articles they find and government documents and proclamations
What good is a day-pass to the Vatican Archives?  		What would you look for?  	Where would you begin?  	How would you know  what to cross-reference what you do find with other information you  already know?
Available to anyone - 'if' you know where to look.  If you even know to look to begin with...
What 'Dark to Light' to me means is the sharing of that too-quickly published and then hidden pieces of vital information that the MSM works so hard to hide. 		Oh they put it out there for us to see and for the most part, it's left there for all to find
Dark to Light
To open people's eyes to the information being blatantly paraded in front of us at ticker-tape speed and then quickly shuffled off into darkness. We grab those snippets of information and then dive deeper and get other, corroborating information and then share it with other anons
Anons are not prophets - neither is Q.  Nor are we some sort of crazy   high priests to deliver the word of Q.  		no, we are chroniclers.  We are  observers and messengers.  		Our intent -  and by association, Q's intent -  is to share that information
Then I came to another realization.
And most, if not all, I saw to be wrong.
I saw all these predictions being made by anons and attributed to Q.   Hell I made a few poor predictions based on my own even worse decodes.
Clues as to what to look for - if not directly.
and then I realized - we weren't being given arcane puzzles to solve, we  were just being given information that's available - if you look with  the right sort of eyes - strewn about the web in main stream journalism.
I examined image meta information and converted hexidecimal to string, integers, you name it.
over the following months I followed the drops with a skeptical eye and a  questioning mind.  I dug the digs, I turned over stones, I chased down  freakin international banking transaction routing numbers.
Interesting.  Lets look more.
What's this?
But they were a hobby of mine.  So I listen to a lot of videos in the  background, while working or playing games or driving.  So late Oct I  kept hearing the same name pop up ... Q Clearance Patriot.
I enjoy conspiracy theories - but I don't buy into, well, really any.   9/11 I still have some pretty strong reservations about but most I feel  like I've personally picked apart, disected and proved to be hoaxes - or  at best partial truths.
over 2017 I kept seeing Trump say utterly bizarre things and being  called out by the MSM - and then... the thigns he said invariably were  proven out to be true.  Then the calm before the storm comments... 		what's this?
Then, a few days before the election, I saw @StevePieczenik's video about the counter-coup from the intel community.  Didn't think a lot about it but it stood out.  Then the unthinkable happened - Trump actually won...
I was *mostly* awake as far back as the mid 90's, digging into the  monetary-theory for history (vs cause n effect) and brought further  along in 2003 looking into 9/11.  		But that work ostracization seriously pulled me over the line.
Got almost immediately ostracized - without a clue as to why.
honestly that rulebook was used for tinder back in at least 2015 (at  least for me). asked by a coworker who I thought would win and I said  Trump gets GoP and, if Bernie gets Dem he wins overall if HRC does,  Trump.  This as a non-Trump supporter at the time... https://t.co/INTJqpVs63

@DrStrom66 How do?
So yes I - and we - care about What is going on in EU right now. 		However it is also their problem to solve. But i will certainly support them by doing what I can to prevent the media from burying their story
When governments put other nations and non citizens before their own this instills resentment - and seeds of xenophobia and racism. 	By contrast nations that properly care for their own citizens will then have a generous and nurturing population willing to proactively help others
Or, to put it another, completely different way, in the national, economic perspective, nations involved in trade with others help others the best by seeking the best possible deal. Adam Smith and John Nash received a Nobel Prize for recognizing this.
Helping family, for example, is the right thing to do - and expected. But helping so much your own children go hungry, or neglected of emotional support is wrong.
Had someone tweet at me asking why maga cares about what goes on in Germany (and by extension France, Belgium, Sweden etc). 		#MAGA and Nationalism is not selfishness and lack of empathy. It is ensuring not to extend so far in helping others that you cannot care for yourself.

@Shenanigunzzz @CK_Limited @LauraLoomer Calm down, clearly I agree with you in the main point. 		Consider the difference in cost of an apartment or house in South Dakota compared to New York or California. Yes, that‚Äôs a whole different issue, but cost of living does vary greatly.
@Shenanigunzzz @CK_Limited @LauraLoomer It may not be a bad idea to consider having apartments (modest, think dorms in college or barracks rooms - with a little extra.  maybe a Hotel 6 type room?)  provided via the state or federal budgeting?		as it stands now, it's extraordinarily prohibitive for non-rich to represent
@Shenanigunzzz @CK_Limited @LauraLoomer You crack jokes about this (and technically I did too) but it's apparently pretty common for legislators to sleep in their offices, due to the extremely high rents in DC - and the need to maintain a residence in their districts as well.
@drericbergdc in plain terms, can extremely low calorie diets cause elevation in blood pressure?  If yes, due to what factors and how can this be mitigated?
@pakalamazoo @SethAbramson If Treason were the charge then there would be no need to hide behind newspeak.		That does not validate 'collusive crimes', collusion or anything of the sort.  The phrase you are looking for is 'opposition research' - which is legal, no matter that you may not like it. https://t.co/aJPmhDfek7
@pakalamazoo @SethAbramson I could say the same in return.		Agree to disagree - this conversation is going nowhere.
@pakalamazoo @SethAbramson Also, if 'collusion' were a crime, there's AMPLE public domain information to indict Hillary for it a dozen times over.
@pakalamazoo @SethAbramson Find the the statue.  I'll happily change my mind.  However, being an individual grounded in facts, wishcasting doesn't do it for me.
@pakalamazoo @SethAbramson I know exactly what is being implied and I also know there is exactly 0 federal statutes in which such implied 'charges' would fall under. 	Thus, I would like mr Abramson to define it for us, either to clarify his position and prove me wrong - or to accurately label it propaganda
@pakalamazoo Oh, right.	So you're one of 'those' enlightened ones that believes everybody that disagrees with you is a bot.	noted.
@pakalamazoo @SethAbramson I'm not the one using the nonsensical word salad.  If one is going to invent terms, they need to provide the definition of said terms.

@mitchellvii I would, however, be remiss if I did not also point out that the slobbering mob on the left eating up the silly allegations these 2 brought forth did far more harm than they did...

@Estivel @Styx666Official @POTUS I understand that quite well.  Rasmussen going up that much suggests others likely have went up as well.  Also, not having the time to track them nor even knowing which ones are worthwhile vs shit, I refer to those that already have the interest and knowledge.

That moment when you have an imcredibly funny thought and go to share on SM - and realise that 1 ur ago at most would get a few offended responses; 5 yrs ago everyone would laugh n share. But now would almost certainly earn a ban. :(

@TwitterMoments this... is a nothingburger		Speaking to fund raisers about things everybody knows, nobody thinks otherwise (left or right, it's pretty clear what happens if the GOP loses the house) and isn't in any way out of the norm much less illegal?	that anyone thinks this is big is deranged
@UNIRockTV @YouTube you 'exposed' the source code - wow, nice find!		Oh wait... it's just an openly accessible (for a reason) github repository and feature discussion...		Mind blowing...
@Thomas1774Paine Yeah and the link is Seth Rich.		Come on, catch up - we can't wait for you.
@seanhannity While the left and never-trumpers suffer from TDS, the right #MAGA suffers from #HannitusInterruptus		Let your damned guests speak! you completely waste their time (and ours)

@McConnellsNeck @realDonaldTrump ok, lets have a re-vote.  Today.  Winner take all for the next 6 years.		No?	didn't think so - stfu and quit crying because your candidate was too stupid to actually campaign where it mattered.

@ScottAdamsSays Oh. And the ‚Äòpattern‚Äô is this:  depending on the viewer and what they already believe to be true:	jp can be jack posobiec or john podesta	Ks can be kirk schlicter or kansas (mike pompeo)	SA can be Scott Adams or Saudi Arabia		Again Q is a rorschach and thats what Scott is saying
@ScottAdamsSays Don't bother to reply or attack me - I will not respond. You know my position and I am confident in the information I have.  I do not need to defend against your assumptions and I don't need to say more to convince.  I don't really care in your believe honestly.		Good Bye.
@ScottAdamsSays Look into Q or not.  You will see what you set out to, to begin with.		But the underlying movement and symbolism is here.  And 'that' is very real.  With that, I've already posted FAR more than I ever intended to publicly.
@ScottAdamsSays Symbols do not require 'your' belief to be meaningful to those that do believe.		Nor do facts.  Facts do not require your belief.  They just require your willingness to verify them.
@ScottAdamsSays So 'Q' being real or being a LARP at this point is irrelevant.		Symbols have power - Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha, etc.  These personas are symbols.  Almost certainly real, living, breathing men at some point in the distant past.		But they transcended mere humanity and became symbols.
@ScottAdamsSays Or are you looking for a savior?
@ScottAdamsSays So, it is up to you, as the individual really.	Do you care more about peeking under the covers and doing some work to to get real information that you yourself has vetted, corroborated and confirmed or rejected?
@ScottAdamsSays In the words of 'Q' - You have more than you know (in the form of public domain info).  The choice to know is yours.
@ScottAdamsSays There are as many people '$h1+' posting nonsense or misleading info as there are those genuinely interested in being truthful (it IS 8chan afterall...)
@ScottAdamsSays Nor is it for those prone to confirmation bias or unwilling to toss aside preconceptions.		Be self critical, be open minded and above all, be prepared to do your own validation of any information offered up.
@ScottAdamsSays So back to the massive Rorschach that is 'Q'		Believe or dont.	But if your'e curious - and you have a strong distrust of the MSM and in our governmental transparency - then go take a look.		Be warned - 8ch is an ugly place.  it's not for the gentle souls, or the easily offended.
@ScottAdamsSays Quit the opposite actually.		it just means we uncover information that largely gets buried in the news cycle or as often as not, ignored all together once put out there.
@ScottAdamsSays Links are provided to the supporting information.  Sometimes 'Q' verifies/acknowledges the links and subsequent speculation.  Most of the times 'Q' does not.  This does not mean that the information that's been unearthed is invalid.
@ScottAdamsSays This evidence is spread over a variety of sources such as MSM reporting (rarely right leaning sites). Government press releases. FOIA requests. Open source transaction histories. Wikileaks, and the like
@ScottAdamsSays Once the crazy has been entertained and summarily discounted, real information has been identified in the form of demonstrably factual evidence.
@ScottAdamsSays The information thats been dug up as a consequence of the Q posts has often lead to extremely bizarre conclusions - however those conclusions have also been largely debunked and tossed aside by the ‚Äòold guard‚Äô. 		But this is the case with any good brainstorming session
@ScottAdamsSays As of now, Q is a rorschach test and while those around since the beginning strongly believe, thats because they put the drops and subsequent validation of the info in the first couple months drops through the ringer, those who come after must decide for themselves https://t.co/UkRRucwyUc

@thelacowboy @ShultzRp @EyeTheSpy @Blunted3652 See Robert Schock, Graham Hancock, John Anthony West,  Robert Bauval and Randall Carlson.  They may not be 100% accurate (likely not) but they're theories are based on 'very' solid evidence - and it's becoming even more solid as new research surfaces. Eg Firestone group.
@thelacowboy @ShultzRp @EyeTheSpy @Blunted3652 You can flip your logic on its head pretty easily when you consider prior antediluvian civilizations.  Much of the numerological repetition we see in historical architecture, legends and documents could just as easily be drawn 'from' those speeds and measurements.
@EyeTheSpy @AllahUniversal piggy back here - AI is in most cases referred to (commercially) as machine learning, but that's rudimentary AI.  		Larger super-nationals routinely use AI for a good portion of their higher-level operations.  It's trickling down however as it becomes more mature.

@BarbaraBtperry @Debradelai In that, Dreeban would be correct and the judge would be wrong, yes.		However depending on the legality of the original FISA warrant, and depending on the wording of the previous (out of thread) memo that the judge has requested, it could predicate grounds to toss it all out.
@BarbaraBtperry @Debradelai This touches on why I'd asked @Debradelai to expand his thinking a bit.  Not so I can argue or debate, just so I can understand and maybe get other info or insights.  The way I see it, right or wrong is taken out of context the request to dismiss is invalid - the judge is wrong.

Steps to improve safety:	1) provide and train ALL teachers with NON-Lethal but debilitating defensive weapons (stun-guns etc)	2) place Ex-Infantry vets and/or Off duty police officers in each school as SROs. 	3) follow up thoroughly on any/all reports of potential threats

@dbongino @Cernovich @realDonaldTrump 	So just throwing this idea out to a few people here - hopefully it gets retweeted.		How about instead of arming teachers with guns, arm ALL teachers with debilitating but non-lethal weapons and annual training on usage.		Then talk abt SROs..

@donwtatro @Breaking911 But like most of the left‚Äôs useful idiots, you would rather grandstand and continue to pretend to care.

@donwtatro @Breaking911 Taking mg away the tool does bot take away the motivation it just causes those bent on destruction to be more creative. 		Besides AR-15‚Äôs - and assault rifles of any type - are used in a ‚Äòvery‚Äô snall percentage of crimes, both in body count total and in individual incidents.
@donwtatro @Breaking911 If you really wanted to solve the problem you would be looking at what causes people to be compelled to violence - and not simply attempt to blame a tool. 		Far more destruction can be achieved via a $50 expenditure at Home Depot and Walmart and a little bit of chemistry.
@donwtatro @Breaking911 So you are saying you dont have a clue but you are willing to scream your ignorance for all to see. 		Seems far more likely its you that is the bot here - but being rational I find it far more likely you are just an idiot

@perrycomo_ @realDonaldTrump @nypost Did you read the indictment yourself?  Or have you simply parroted what you have heard?  If so you would know at least 65 of them are not even illegal acts. 		Time will tell, but that indictment reeks of face-saving desperation and Ill be surprised now if anything at all follows
@perrycomo_ @realDonaldTrump @nypost How many months did it take to find a handful of individuals to indict who had at most a minimal impact on the election in an effort to justify a probe that was predicated on perjury and unsubstantiated claims?		The post-2016 far left are making the post-2008 far right look sane.
@KamalaHarris Or continue business as usual as the DNC goes bankrupt and we the people get to watch a red wedding this fall as your ‚ÄòBlue Wave‚Äô evaporates like a puddle on hot pavement
@KamalaHarris How about you stop using immigrants - and more pointedly, stop using DACA as human shields, lyong to them about caring so much about them, yet willing to toss them aside entirely as well as shut the Govt down over a wall that would cost less than the cost OF that shutdown?
That indictment is one of the darkest legal documents I have ever read. Extremely disturbing in the sheer number and severity of attacks on perfectly legal activity.
The bulk majority of the ‚Äòcharges‚Äô are not even against the law. 		Deleting an old facebook or twitter profile in which you did not your real, full name and possibly posted comment on a political topic (ANY topic), is now destruction of evidence of fraud?
Most of that indictment is a direct attack on us, US citizens.  Hell, it effectively makes playing an online video game or chatting in IRC or slack, posting on reddit etc. under a pseudonym (screen name) a criminal act
This 13 person indictment - if ‚Äòthis‚Äô is all that the Mueller probe turns up literally everybody - no matter the party or personal opinion on Trump - everybody should be outraged. 		And if the prosecution of most of the indictment is successful, we should all be terrified
@thehill You are fair-skinned enough to, yes.
Based on an actual read through of the Mueller indictment of the Russian 'hackers' there could very easily be an argument made that there is evidence of Russia helping 'Hillary' in the 2016 election...

@TheDemocrats Historically, tax cuts raise revenue. Look it up before replying - and check a few sources. Corporations and the 1% dont pay taxes, no matyer the tax rate; they pass the burden on in the form of downsizing, off-shoring and raising prices of goods hitting the poorest the hardest.

@PLiberalism @bobsnee @Debradelai Now the question is why did Mueller even file the indictment, given that we all know who the agent interviewing Flynn was, that the interview was not under oath and other, very relevant and concerning questions
@abd_ijtihad @bobsnee @Debradelai I already withdrew in a subsequent tweet.  Indictment wasn't until Nov 30th 2017, so I was incorrect.  However reason to expedite and not postpone remains - which makes it even more curious.
@PLiberalism @bobsnee @Debradelai Yep I'd incorrectly thought the indictment was filed prior to the SC being appointed.  Nov 30th 2017 was the actual filing date.  This date means Mueller had to know there was plenty of reason to not pursue charges against Flynn - at least not without casting considerable doubt
@Debradelai Damn, I was incorrectly assuming the indictment had been filed long before it actually was.  Apparently wasn't filed until Nov 30th 2017.  Changes a few things in my mind re: Mueller et. all.		I retract previous tweets on this topic.
@bobsnee @Debradelai The flynn indictment was not a product of the Mueller investigation.  There is, actually, every reason for Mueller to either stay out of the way or expedite it, not postpone it.

That is what will be, essentially, the start of the 'real' indictments which will follow either immediately after, or, within days.
@Debradelai @GenFlynn And in fact, work with Flynn in some fashion, to put off sentencing as long as possible to fully emesh all bad actors before vacating Flynn's plea, dropping the case and then filing counter charges against those involved illegally.
@Debradelai @GenFlynn The original charge of the process crime and subsequent legal action against Flynn did not originate from the Mueller investigation - which started months later...	It would be in the best interest of a SC investigation which is not actually investigating Trump to let this ride
@Debradelai @GenFlynn Having read the full thread now (finally) I want to point out 1 little fact missed in your thread - that also is supporting evidence to both your assertions and to the idea that the Mueller investigation either never was or else long since, moved on from investigating Trump

@NatashaBertrand When you realize, by validating the actions that are outlined within that memo you are setting the precedent for targeting the opposition party via the IC to affect an election - by whoever happens to be in office at the time - I hope you have the integrity to admit you are wrong

@jonathanvswan lol	For the Lawyers and those that have followed it closely, it's the equivalent of M-109 artillery fire, softening up the target	For the causal reader, it's simply confirmation bias reinforced or has nobody stopped to wonder why Schiff++ tried so hard to stop it?

@CLWD600 @ThomasWictor @gerrybuddy Yes.	Also remember, the OIG was equally hamstrung at the time.  No oversight of certain sections of the FBI (((CI))) And who was deeply embedded in CI?	Stork (misspelling intentional) among others... patterns within patterns
@CLWD600 @ThomasWictor @gerrybuddy Now he's stepping down just as 'phase 2' kicks off by Nunes - yeah Gowdy will still be around for a while - but I have a feeling we'll see him back in Washington soon enough.  And in a role much better suited for him.		Remember, he never endorsed Trump.
@CLWD600 @ThomasWictor @gerrybuddy Gowdy stepping down; Nunes being blasted - and when asked if he'd read the docs he stated 'no' there was someone better suited to take the trip to the SCIF - Gowdy.  Gowdy read the docs, took notes, brought them back and, for all intents n purposes, crafted the memo.	*BOOM*

@impercipient @jeeezelouise @BoomStryker @danieljenkins @KimStrassel @doctorcherokee @POTUS FBI requested some changes be made; Nunes made those changes, Schiff then accused Nunes of changing it significantly; he did not but medianran with it anyway. Was sent to POTUS and FBI met with Kelly and requested more changes as of now that is where it sits. 	There was a process
@impercipient @jeeezelouise @BoomStryker @danieljenkins @KimStrassel @doctorcherokee After anple opportunity for the entire house to view, they allowed the counter-intel members of FBI and DOJ to view before voting to send to POTUS to release. At that time there was no factual inaccuracies found; next day McCabe fired, house IC voted to request @POTUS release
@impercipient @jeeezelouise @BoomStryker @danieljenkins @KimStrassel @doctorcherokee The house ic voted initially tonrelease the first memo. Dems shut it down. They then agreed to release the memo to house members only - and fornover a week it was available to the entire house; only 12 dems chose to view - and review - it. Including the dems on the ic.

@thehill Bullshit.	If that were the case a number of things would have went down (during - and following)	41:20 the camera starts pulling back and going black about 15 seconds later a clear and calm 'shut it down, shut it down' is heard.  Then feed cuts.	https://t.co/vAYLUI35Ob  Planned
Maybe it's just me and a result of following too many mouth pieces in the MSM - but did the volume of articles being posted just go way up?		#RNCFeedCut and not a single peep from the main news outlets.  Clearly not unexpected or they'd be screaming - instead we're getting cake

@KurtSchlichter Report it for targeted harassment
@anotherarabb I feel out of fairness and transparency I have reported this tweet as a call for targeted harassment.
So which is it, cultural appropriation or fashion accessories?  I am losing track of the conversation, it changes so quickly. 		Freedom of Speech is a thing - however it also has limitations; your call for harassment falls under yelling fire in a crowded theater https://t.co/GPF5AuOKrH
@SenBlumenthal It's not the GoP that is coming off as anxious, nervous or frantic here.		The memo will in all likelihood be nothing more than confirmation-bias fodder (for both sides really) but thus far, it's not really Nunes or the house Republicans that seem more than simply hyperbolic
@thehill Can someone cite where Trump and/or one of his administration claimed it did?		Seriously - I've heard both sides, and both claims but I've not seen where either is cited to really see for myself.
@dlaquarabbit @conspirator0 wow, never heard of https://t.co/JDEKg3dEog - or maybe I have but dismissed it.  Checking out the first sentence of wikipedia explains why		"New York is an American biweekly magazine concerned with television, sex, and occasionally politics..."		Quite the source
@thehill I'm still stuck trying to digest @Comey teaching ethical leadership.		Such a strange world we live in.

@Magicscooter @1mjas nice attempt to flip the script.  You're the initial questioner.		Good day.
@Magicscooter @1mjas HRC lied to the FBI, Congress and the American people.  Why was she not charged?  volumes of texts, emails and actual on the record testimony support charges having been filed - and on numerous occasions.		And yet... RUSSIHAA!!!! :\ give me a break.
@Magicscooter @1mjas and as I've said I strongly support this 'investigation' (hard to call it that, without a crime to be investigated - collusion is a fabrication with no supporting statute to be in violation of) is exposing considerable corruption - though not by the Trump admin or transition team
RT @exjon: IIRC, Joe McCarthy spun fevered conspiracy theories about Russians controlling the government. https://t.co/3AXDdOtm6V
@Magicscooter @1mjas Furthermore, in the case of Flynn, his 'crime' was lying to the FBI - Strozk explicitly - who is himself under investigation for actual obstruction of justice and interference by the OIG - and Flynn was acting in accordance to the law in all activities.
@Magicscooter @1mjas I have and nothing that any of the above are being charged on are related to any Russian interference	My sources are the filings and the correspondence between the oversight committees, the Mueller team and the OIG.	Rosenstein did not cite any statute alleged to be in violation

@Magicscooter @1mjas by shooting blanks I mean every direction that's been attempted to 'expose' 'crimes' (by the way, what statute is being alleged to be violated?) has boomeranged back onto the previous admin and HRC campaign.	I'm ok with letting it finish - exposing corruption of prev. admin.

@DonnaLetournea2 @RepAdamSchiff Cute.	You do realize all the cloak-and-dagger about this #memo and the attempts to hide it fall squarely into tinfoil hat land	It exists; the FBI has stated there is no factual discrepencies and only lacks some context; Schiff has had 3 diff. reasons why it's 'fake' now.	hmm
@KCRebel702 @RepAdamSchiff Well, according to many who 'have' read that memo it's going to be 'very embarassing' for Mr Schiff.  Lets read it and find out shall we?
@girls_smarter That would be correct.  Did you have anything to add?  Or simply providing an interactive Websters dictionary?
@_beaverhousen @mikebank_ @RepAdamSchiff Nor was mine - but you sure felt compelled to 'make a literal statement' to what you thought was a 'comeback'.

@PJforAmerica @Thomas1774Paine Based on how I understand the situation, the memo produced in the house ic is different - although probably loosely related - to the OIg report, which is being sent to the senate JOC (grassely and goodlatte).   Nunes info comes from fbi/nsa/potus daily brief docs directly.
@RepAdamSchiff I've also seen reports that the DoJ rep and the +1 FBI rep that visited and viewed the memo on Sunday could not find any objections to the memo.		Somebody is lying - and if you are to be believed, then is somebody at the FBI.  Not a good look - how about 'we' decide for ourselves
@Thomas1774Paine She claims to have seen both the memo and the underlying documents - yet even Nunes (if you believe certain news outlets also taking part in this video here) hasn't even seen the underlying documents.		How?  Pretty big breach of protocol isn't it?
@MSNBC @CNN @FoxNews @CBSNews @abcnews 	Please stop with the shouting matches during 'interviews' - and while we're at it, please do away with 'panel' discussions.  They're anything but - and all the tagged orgs do it.  Stop.	Just stop. https://t.co/oZAWVxzgu4
My first memory of watching news was during the Iran hostage crisis.  I remember how dignified the anchors were, how respectful.  I remember interviews being an informative give and take (although I didn't understand a word of them of course)	I miss news being presented like that
@funder Do you have any proof of these claims?  Or are you begging for a libel suit?
@Hawksmagic @Debradelai So.. sorta like pretty much anybody else we'll meet on a day-to-day basis then.  Ok.
@FujiwaraNoSai33 @FoxNews But just answer me one question - why would the previous administration actively block the Office of the Inspector General from doing any oversight of the FBI Counter-Intel branch?  What possible good could come of that.
@FujiwaraNoSai33 @FoxNews So don't believe me - I'd prefer you not and that you go read the OIG-SJC correspondence.		The activity with the FBI and investigations you are seeing now have been building - and ongoing - since long prior to Trump taking office.  In fact, before he ever even announced running.

@FujiwaraNoSai33 @FoxNews The McCabe firing? (Yes he was fired, don't kid yourself) That immediately followed Wray and 2 other DOJ/FBI reps reading the 'memo' that Schiff so badly wants to block.  The OIG investigation itself?  Started 2 years ago - prior to Trump winning much less entering office.
@FujiwaraNoSai33 @FoxNews The investigations that are going on now and catching so much partisan attention?  Those actually started in 2012 and the OIG had been told it couldn't do any oversight of the counter-intel branch of the FBI.  That changed starting ~2015 when Grassley/Goodlatte started poking.
@FujiwaraNoSai33 @FoxNews Trump is a bombastic, loud mouthed, antagonistic individual.  But he's also getting many things done our country has needed for decades.  As for the FBI - the FBI as a whole is a very good institution.  It's the leadership that's been tainted - and should be cleaned out.
@FujiwaraNoSai33 @FoxNews I was a never-trumper as well, up until I actually started reading the correspondence myself and then, really started paying attention to more than just what came out at 6 and 10 on TV.  When I really started understanding how badly I'd been lied to - and by whom - it angered me.
@FujiwaraNoSai33 @FoxNews of what?  Are you bothering to read the communications that have went back n forth between the OIG and Grassley/Goodlatte?  Also, you do realize Rosenstein is who recommended that Comey be fired.  Speaking of Comey, you really should read the communications I referred to.
@SenSanders Yeah the Democratic shutdown in the Senate certainly did a fantastic job of helping fix that problem didn't it?
@FujiwaraNoSai33 @FoxNews Oh?  Tell me more about the rich boy from a political dynasty talking about a living wage - who by the way, never served either	You do realize that the real pressure on the FBI isn't coming from Trump.  It's coming from the OIG investigation which the O admin obstructed for years
@FujiwaraNoSai33 @FoxNews What's the matter, you're losing the argument as you framed it so you're changing the discussion?

@FujiwaraNoSai33 @FoxNews As for getting sensitive, dont be a disingenuous twit. You attempt to use the military as an emotional lever expect to get ‚Äòsensitive‚Äô replies when you donso in such an obviously ill informed manner.
@FujiwaraNoSai33 @FoxNews So tell the whole story, stats for each operational theater as well as new operations and then finally training casualties. If you are unwilling to do so then you are willfully blind - and agenda driven. Either that or stupid - and you dont strike me as the latter.
@FujiwaraNoSai33 @FoxNews You speak of facts as if raw figures actually speak neutrally across the full dataset. Cherry picking is great for those with an agenda. Go look at casualties in Iraq, Afghanistan, etc.  fallen dramatically in 2017 even with troop build ups (thats actually why they fell)

@YesThatMGibson @Twel864 @Disgone @RedditCFB That, and I don't think KU has finished paying off the last 2 bad hires completely to screw with trying to keep that loop track going.  Clean the slate, then have some extra cash laying around to look for the next savior.
@coachseansnyder Loved the show of emotion and give-a-shit today.  Well done sir.  The effect on the team was amazing.
@GTCat_EMAWdio @GPCwallace Thank you
@GPCwallace What exactly is the word on DJ Reed?  What is his injury - even rumors would be welcome at this point.  Or did he just piss off the wrong staff member...
@PJ_Drumm Then it‚Äôs not being made right
Just updated to #iOS11; if I didnt already know Steve was dead I would now.
@SprotsBae I often skip lunch for that same reason.
@TylerDreiling I'm done with this staff.  Just done.  Performances like that (by the coaching staff not players - they can only play as well as they're taught to play) would be grounds for dismissal at a fast food restaurant making minimum wage - and those performances have been put on repeat
@CoachBillSnyder What the hell was that abortion I saw this afternoon.  It's time to clean house on staff members that clearly are not capable of executing the responsibilities that millions of dollars of state money are being paid out for.
I'm not sure how but I just caused Visual Studio to freak to hell out - almost as if I'd given it a x = n / 0 where a = 1, solve for n
@jonfmorse Go listen to the enemy and Listen quietly and Know your enemy to choose the best attack - if he hasnt already buried himself.
@jonfmorse My mother used to store frying pans in the oven - until the 3rd or 4th time she had to clean melted handle off the racks and bottom
@JSisco16 @adelton005 He did fine. My questions are targeted elsewhere.
@davidubben Ksu had several phantom holds last week v UT also (as well as officials icing McCrane in 2 nd OT) so...  yeh
@THESagerbomb That... sounds awful
@royalskc21 @TheHawklin @KellisRobinett Self evaluation starts at the leadership level, and good leadership never involves shifting blame, even when that may b the 'correct' placmt
@TexasFootball @Big12Conference When the refs iced the KSU kicker I hing it up. uT wasnt going to be allowed to lose.
@GPCwallace Play calling was senility incarnate - more impactful than anything else
@TylerDreiling No sir.
@PatrickMahomes5 Any time I see OkSt doing badly it's a good game.
@TylerDreiling If the defense is where you have a problem with this KSU cats team then I have to question your priorities (or football knowledge)
@KellisRobinett What is your outlook on a game-by-game basis as of now, post-Viasco?
Great Video. 	Been on all 3 'team types' and lead a few of them also.		"Management done right is a really tough job"	https://t.co/YPN8d6VQzu
@dannolan @slace Am I really that late to the party?  Im just. Ot that impressed with Docker (yet).
@SprotsBae Suggest to him that kneeling is just as respectful.  Better that, by far, then just sittin on the bench or not taking a moment at all. :)
@SprotsBae Ah.		Well then he and I have no problem - not even the minor disagreement I'd originally thought.  GOod man.
@SprotsBae Just as him this:  What did he and those friends that died serve for?  to protect freedoms or to enforce coercion via popular consent?
@SprotsBae I don't find any issue with his view by the way - but this is full of poo.  Nobody does.
@SprotsBae It's a nice story.  But it's just that - a story.  If true, it would literally make him the 'only' person 'ever'.
@SprotsBae Ask the original writer of those texts where he or she was every day during taps - was he always out standing at attention?  unlikely.
Dunno how it tool me this long to discover Brickleberry. And, its officil, there are no lines left to cross in entertainment any more.
I'm not sure what is more irritating.  spending hours trying to solve a code problem - or - solving that problem without knowing what u did
@chip_pringle Im a 5th generation vet, combat arms (11b/13B) and I served to protect freedoms. Not to enforce coercion via popular consent
@RedditCFB How is FSU still ranked in the coaches poll?
@CkSeitz @fox4kc Did you read the article or just the tweet
@housecor In addition to that is
@housecor Among your videos on PS, what would you recommend consuming to get started into both and what preferred ide?
@housecor If you have time, what tech stacks and framework version or libraries do your teams utilize?
@ryanp5579 @jrbratten @KellisRobinett Congrats on your program building caliber win. For us it was just a poor Saturday performance. Difference between the programs right there
@commodorefan121 @KellisRobinett cant turn back clocks but officiating should be accountable and we shud expect 2c improvement. Next time it may be your team
@commodorefan121 @KellisRobinett No, rational KSU fans are aware that play calling and mistakes cost the game. Bad officiating occurs 2 often to not b challenged by all
@gcaughey derp.  realized 'after' I hit reply on my last post that this is from the MS sample database project.		Carry on!
@StrawnBob @GPCwallace P5 membership...
@housecor Looks like refresh issues and may be the cygwin host?
@HillisRicky @KellisRobinett to put it another way, even gifted 1 Td and having one taken off the. Oard, with the KSU offense playing like shit still only won by 1 TD
@HillisRicky @KellisRobinett Ok if we are going to play 'that' game explain the blatant holding when vandy got the 2nd TD.
@housecor tried it but it's pretty buggy unfortunately.  I had high hopes, but ultimately went back to bash
@golfluvr13 @jonfmorse Wtf?  Thats 2 decent human things that are OU fans. The world really is gonna end on the 23rd!
@GPCwallace I didn't see enough out of the Cats to honestly agree with you.  Poor execution all around on Offense and Defense worn down for lack of help
@Allen_Robinson @PJ_Drumm Bad passing all around.  The passing game was off - you can't argue that.  2 ypc is shit.  76 yds total compared to 201 yds?  unbelievable!
@PBWenta @TylerDreiling No one would argue that bad calls didn't lose this game - mistakes by KSU did.  But bad calls are bad calls and there were a few obvs ones
@NiemanLab @KrisKetzKMBC If all you're getting your news from is facebook then nothing can help you
@Allen_Robinson @PJ_Drumm 35 rushing attempts for 201 yards - that's over 5 yards / carry.  Running the ball was working.  refusal to stay with what (and who) worked
@Chuckie__2424 Welcome to the outside, looking in.  Sucks doesn't it :\
@_POOH_BEAR5 Fwiw most of the reasonable fans dont place blame on the players in that exhibition. something isnt working, adjustments should been made
@Allen_Robinson @PJ_Drumm When a certain offensive attack is not working or players arent executing for some reason good OCs will make adjustments. None were made.
@GPCwallace I disagree.	The play calling was the worst I've seen in a very, very long time - absolutely no ability to make any meaningful adjustments.
@curtiskitchen Unbelievably bad play calling. When the receivers cant catch even when its on target... pass more?  What the fuck
@jonfmorse 50/50 too high vs plain dropped
LA Tech put themselves into a 3rd and 98	How does that happen you ask?  Lets find out shall we? https://t.co/PXSykmc3gT
@paterfamilias @Taylor_Estes_ Italics might have helped telegraph the sarcasm
@LifeofFitz lol your tweet however was epic (fail)
@Taylor_Estes_ @GTCat_EMAWdio They're getting it - or did you miss the 2-step-interception-then-down-for-5-seconds-and-ball-comes-out incomplete pass call
@LifeofFitz Don't think I didn't see that first post attempt.  I only wish I had taken a screenshot - the irony was intense!
@joerogan @henryrollins @benshapiro @jordanbpeterson Oops all 4 of u And of all your clear and unambiguous articulation of point of view. It would be a fascinating exchange with broad appeal
@joerogan i would love to see you set up a conversation between @henryrollins and @benshapiro or @jordanbpeterson respect all 3 of you.
@hill_tyreek Great game tonight
@jeff_rosen88 @KrisKetzKMBC achilles :&lt;
@neiltyson I dont disagree - not completely anyway- but there is a severe disconnect between credit value and real world application or ind. interests
@GPCwallace Dunno how the choice presented is really a question :)
@KilloughJustin @jonfmorse Gotta buy it on amazon - netflix dropped scrubs :/
@jonfmorse Anything bill n ted
@BuckeyeEmpire @RedditCFB Remember Mora flipping his shit about KSU attempting to submarine on a spike to get the ball back?  yeah... this is why Mora, you dbag
@FrogPreacher WVU:  Hold my beer
@RedditCFB To the letter of the rule it was a late hit but it was also bs.  dude tiptoeing down the side line and stepped out just as he got hit
@Timcast Antifa represents the modern communist faction where the nazi's are, well, nazi's.		Both historically are steeped in atrocity and equally so
@curtiskitchen @espn Buffering again?
@GPCwallace All I could reasonably take from that game was UT should not have been ranked - not even a single vote until they start handling business
@SprotsBae You probably cared more abpit it than either Katie or Tom
@KansasTurnpike so what was the thought process that went into cutting the # of cash-ticket kiosks on I70 between KC and Topeka?  #fail
@davidubben And there they went - rude to leave again so quickly
@Sean_Boston_23 #KUCheerSquad probably could, from what I've seen - or is that the stronger squad for KU?  I forget
@TylerDreiling @jonfmorse So, laps n shuttle runs it is
Is there no one at #youtube that have young children using their kids app?  App icons and UI/UX changing on kids apps are hell for parents
@jonfmorse Anything concrete ever surface?
Cool thing abt excel i can compare dumb spending this yr to past yrs.  sucky thing?  It's about the same...	apparently I don't learn lessons
@MuslimIQ I guess it depends on how you view that data - refugee bans work?		But seriously, it's a ridiculous comparison and doesn't really help.
@housecor In a future era, qbits
@jonfmorse How much do you know about Antifa - beyond what the name was derived from?
@Timcast The extreme centrists just want the two edge groups to go away and quit attempting to incite a civil war.
@Timcast Try 'Why we're effed' or screwed or something a bit less profane
It is with great anticipation that I look forward to news channels eliminating panel 'discussions'.  Shouting each other down is not debate
#Netflix are you trying to tell me and my family to go away?  More shows have went under the axe than nobles in the french revolution lately
"rules and processes exist to expedite business, not ritualize it. Love of procedure often masks a fatal inability to prioritize"
@joerogan Looks like jar jar
@meganphelps @Twitter @michaelianblack @NewYorker Just watched ur podcast w/joe rogan. You are an impressive woman and a powerful intellect. A truly profound person.
Google needs an 'exclude retail results' option. The result for searches that contains a potential product in the terms is abysmal now.
@SenPatRoberts @SenPatRoberts #NoVoteFromMe
@RepKevinYoder Do not support the current and future attacks on net neutrality.  It will cost you my vote as well as anyone I can influence
@PJ_Drumm Twitch/youtube streaming. I recently discovered what those idiots make and its sickening. So thats gotta be it
@jonfmorse apparently Xavier Davis not coming to the Bill. Any info?
@jonfmorse Truth in journalism right here
Sad that my 1st thought was pls dont b a terrorist attack; doesnt appear 2 b aftr reading many comments abt complaints of safety violations https://t.co/iwCg6xiC33
@jonfmorse What, you mean the term genius is not actually a discriminatory masculine term?
@housecor Totally true. Took me far too long to truly 'get' mvc/razor - just coming at it from diff angles
@j_smedley Too bad no one ever made a game in which the adventure was yours.  Oh wait
@ayosaba @jonfmorse Agreed. He did what he should have done no matter where he went - put his team and organization first.
@jonfmorse Walked?  Or were they riding one of those scooters?
@vera_verathomas Yep. Young girl I met at the gym. But pretty obvs as to the why in this case. In your case, prolonged proximity and personality?
@jonfmorse Ha. Yeah. Loved that show
@ChristopTheWade @jfreewright My god did we just have a civil discourse on twitter?  Gather the women and children death and destruction will come of this
@ChristopTheWade @jfreewright The only real diff between Trump and previous administrations is he just isnt bothering to be subtle in his approach to painting a narrative
@ChristopTheWade @jfreewright Although tbh Trump has an agenda and the sensationalism helps his agenda, so the Chomsky suggestion still applies
Big guy with big hands and a small phone means I all too often look illiterate on social media :(
@ChristopTheWade @jfreewright Sounds like we actyally agree then. Good that he uses it. But he does so irresponsibly
@ChristopTheWade @jfreewright To be clear Igreatly disagree with Trump's usage of twitter. I do however think the fact that he uses it os incredibly effective very savvy
@ChristopTheWade @jfreewright If so, then Noam Chomsky would like a word with you
@ChristopTheWade @jfreewright So your suggestion is, then, that radio and TV cant be used as effectively as 'twitter' for influeincing people?
@ChristopTheWade @jfreewright Didnt say I agree with Trump's tweeting - I dot. But your arguments hold no value. Just paint you, possibly incorrectly, as a rabid left
@ChristopTheWade @jfreewright Hacked - no. Faked?  Quite easily and pirate signals are common, knocking radio and antenna based television stations off air. Try again
@ChristopTheWade @jfreewright When the radio - and again later television - was introduced the same was said by a few luddites about officials utilizing them too
@thomaslockes Most do. Dont let the &lt;10% of the extremely vocal right (or left) lead you to thin the rest are stupid. They arent, they are just quiet
@jfreewright Not that I necessarily disagree with you - but what do you suggest he do instead?
@martin_carr @Timcast Possible Likely even. But motive may be to prevent his stutter-step mishandling like the emails issue: Nope!  Yup! maybe.. Er Nope
@Timcast Comey helped but looking at electoral results ahe would have lost anyway. All he did was get those that had tuned out to take a second look
@chriscoyier Check gas stations in the shadier parts of town. Sounds silly - until you realize that shoe laces are also cheap drug paraphernalia.
