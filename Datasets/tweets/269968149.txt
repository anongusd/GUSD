@DroppedValve @bradyqg @GibbsKnotts the level of corruption in this state truly astonishes me.
@bradyqg @GibbsKnotts I counted 12 on that list including DC, &amp; we're the highest in the south. With a median household income of $43k, it's safe to assume the majority pay that 7%. My argument is it's being used inefficiently and I'd like to know how they plan on fixing that.
