Neither the high school graduation requirement for the two IQ tests gauged an employee‚Äôs ability to learn or perform a particular job or class of jobs at Duke. #BlackHistoryMonth
After hearing Greenberg‚Äôs‚ÄØpassionate oral arguments, the Court unanimously held that Duke‚Äôs standardized testing and HS diploma requirements barred Black employees in disproportionate numbers from being hired by, or advancing to higher-paying departments, within the company.
After Title VII went into effect, the company instituted a new transfer, promotion and hiring policy, making completion of high school ‚Äî or achieving scores on two separate IQ tests required to working in any department other than Labor. #BHM
The two LDF attorneys represented 13 African Americans employed at the station. Each had been relegated exclusively to the lowest-paying of the station‚Äôs five departments. Duke openly discriminated against African-American employees.
Recognizing that the disparate impact standard could have a far-reaching and transformative impact,‚ÄØJack Greenberg and‚ÄØJulius Chambers brought suit against Duke Power Company‚Äôs Dan River Steam Station, a power-generating facility located in Draper, North Carolina. #BHM
Under disparate impact analysis, Title VII‚Äôs provisions proscribed not only intentional discrimination but also practices that were ‚Äúfair in form,‚Äù yet discriminatory in operation. Such practices were often artificial, arbitrary, and designed to target African Americans. #BHM
In‚ÄØGriggs, LDF struck a serious blow to discriminatory employment practices and established the legitimacy of ‚Äúdisparate impact‚Äù claims ‚Äî a seminal achievement that transformed America‚Äôs workplaces and provided a powerful legal framework to combat employment discrimination.
These groups fought vigorously to deny equal employment opportunities to African Americans, even going so far as to attempt to block, on technical grounds, class action suits ‚Äî LDF‚Äôs chosen method for litigating employment discrimination. #BHM

Best thing we saw? Our devoted partners in the struggle to reform the NYPD. We‚Äôre proud to be a part of @changethenypd and work alongside amazing coalition partners. There‚Äôs still much work to do, but together we keep fighting for the type of change NYers deserve.
Most upsetting thing we saw? The NYPD panel refused to stay to listen to the testimony of those whose loves ones were killed by the NYPD. There were audible gaps in the room. Such disrespect is appalling - these are the people they need to hear from more than anyone else. https://t.co/M8ahvi9xdP
One stat that jumped out at us: only 41% of the NYPD is operating without complaints of misconduct. That‚Äôs very distressing, but sadly makes sense given what we learned from @KendallTTaggart and @michaelhayes excellent reporting: https://t.co/KsPXeBAPWa
An Independent Panel report recently found that the NYPD chooses low level punishments (like taking away vacation days) for serious crimes like domestic violence, rather than suspension/termination. They think this deters misconduct. We don't buy it. https://t.co/EOkeXS7yq4 https://t.co/0vQCnazdiP
The NYPD claimed that giving the public more info would put officers at risk, but they admitted that when officers‚Äô names were public in recent high profile cases, they received 0 threats. Plus, there wasn't any retaliation against CPD officers when Chicago released similar info.
Not only is there no safety risk to sharing this disciplinary info, but public access to it can foster trust, provide closure to family members directly impacted by abusive policing, and inform NYers about needed reforms.

This past April marked the opening of @eji_org the @MemPeaceJustice in Montgomery, AL. It is a powerful monument dedicated to the victims of racial terror, certain to help Americans engage in some much-needed truth &amp; reconciliation with our shared past. https://t.co/EPef2Cju8Z

Silence that marked the decades of terrorism inflicted on African Americans no longer stands with cameras widely available. @Time's photo essay by Johnathon Kelso w/ text by @Sifill_LDF documents the enduring &amp; often deliberately hidden legacy of lynching. https://t.co/nHv9f6DFAR
The legacy of lynching is the foundation of the Black community's relationship with our criminal justice system. Today there is one key difference, ‚Äúnow you cannot unsee Walter Scott running through the park being shot or Eric Garner being choked to death to death by the #NYPD.‚Äù https://t.co/jaABEGhpKr
It is not an accident that many do not know about the horrific and very public murders of Black Americans. @Sifill_LDF recalls how a local newspaper did not cover a lynching that happened in front 500 people ‚Äúfor the simple reason that everyone [knew] what happened.‚Äù https://t.co/q6cyx3Tj0u
Lynching is a message crime where the very public murders of Black Americans terrorized communities across the nation in the 20th century.

6. Yesterday we sent @sehiabatonrouge a letter demanding they rescind Deputy Shelby's speaker invite. Police officers who fatally shoot unarmed people must not have a platform to discuss how they survived the consequences of their actions.	Read our letter: https://t.co/96yAdJ08qD https://t.co/IUf2boyDHZ
5. The mental and emotional impact of the police killing of Mr. Crutcher, an unarmed Black man, by Deputy Shelby, a white officer, is clear. When concerned Tulsans learned that Deputy Shelby was scheduled to conduct a similar training, the outrage was swift and direct: https://t.co/Jhu7oP5fiv
4. @sehiabatonrouge's choice to amplify Deputy Shelby‚Äôs voice and allow her to be the face of ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù responses to critical incidents will reinforce the divide between community members and law enforcement.
3. Deputy Shelby was charged with first-degree manslaughter and acquitted by a jury a year later.	However, the jurors made the rare decision to also issue a public letter signed by the jury foreman	stating that: https://t.co/pBvgSAu2T6
2. #TerenceCrutcher was the victim of a homicide committed by Deputy Shelby, whose lack of remorse and reflection after the killing demonstrates that she is unfit to instruct homicide investigators how to survive the aftermath of a critical incident.
1. Allowing these officers to now share with a national audience of law enforcement how Deputy Shelby ‚Äúsurvived‚Äù the consequences of a homicide that she committed is inconsistent with the purported work of SEHIA members‚Äîpursuing justice for homicide victims and their families.

‚ÄúDiversity is one of the most meaningful aspects of the preparation that Harvard students receive. Harvard must be permitted to pursue the benefits of diversity if it is to fulfill its educational mission.‚Äù ‚ÄìLDF‚Äôs @CaraMcClellan6 in closing remarks to #DefendDiversity
‚ÄúThe benefits of diversity can be found in the late-night conversations between 2 roommates, 1 Black whose family is from Ghana, 1 Asian American whose family is from Vietnam, assigned to live together in a dorm where they fall asleep talking to each other every night.‚Äù
‚ÄúWithout race-conscious admissions, a substantial reduction in Black and Latinx students would threaten the continued existence of cultural organizations and the benefits they provide,‚Äù summarizes LDF‚Äôs Skadden Fellow @CaraMcClellan6. #DefendDiversity
The evidence presented in the trial to #DefendDiversity at Harvard is clear: ‚Äúpretending to be race-blind when reviewing applications will only disadvantage applicants of color, including Asian American students whose full stories would be ignored.‚Äù ‚ÄìLDF‚Äôs @CaraMcClellan6
