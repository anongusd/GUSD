What's your favorite @GratefulDead dead song right now? 		I'm torn between St. Stephen and Scarlet Begonias right now. Literally had a dream with the second as a soundtrack... #longstrangetrip #deadhead #gratefuldead
#LivePd #LivePDNation well that took a quick turn. 		"Hold on a second!"
#LivePD #LivePDNation 		Domestic disputes are my least favorite. She/he said, often both look bad and no good resolutions. And it's sad to see families breaking apart, normally over #alcohol.
Watching #LivePD for the first time in a couple weeks. Good background nonsensw to my new year resolution learn guitar! #Resolution2019
@danielbkof2 I understand your view, but saying defend the country until the rapture is little different than until the end of time, that isn't in any way constitutionally unacceptable. Religious leaders can use religious sayings and analogies, leaders do it constantly! #religion
That interaction on #livepd shows the systemic racism in LE. 		"I've been through this before." Citizen		"That's nothing to be proud of." Officer		If he has been pulled over for DWB, what else can you do but know your rights? #racism #LawEnforcement
@danielbkof2 The video doesn't show him supporting any religion on behalf of USA. He uses religious imagery relatable to him and the audience. Const. Doesn't restrict an official from having a religion or speaking on it.
