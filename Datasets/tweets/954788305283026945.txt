@peterdaou The testimony has not broken out of the same grounds or similar grounds "politically speaking" of the failed Clinton impeachment. At the heart, it's still all about an affair.  Needs more red meat to move the question about trump forward.  That is why Repubs are still citing HRC.
@dcpoll What are the odds Rep Cummings breakers his gavel trying to keep order over Republicans doing their best to instill chaos.
@dcpoll It looks like no love lost on either side but I watched some of the other hearings that Jordan was part of and, his idea of Fair and following rules is to ask a question then interrupt the witness to rail at him and accusing him of not answering when he never got the chance.
@cmcclain100 @peterdaou 1 reason is that they want to relitigate Clinton impeachment, while at the same time say, Bill Clinton fooled around on HRC and stayed president, it's not fair to unload on trump for a few indulgences. And use that argument to drown out any other question.

@tharon_pleiades @mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 Good night.
@tharon_pleiades @mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 And again, what are you talking about? Your trying to obfuscate and dismiss known bad behavior in a Congress man that is in plain sight by equivocating his behavior with unfounded accusations that have no supporting evidence. And deny actions done in the open for all to see.
@tharon_pleiades @mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 Bruce Ore was doing his job and there is no credible evidence otherwise.  Lots of accusations from your dear leader, but no verifiable evidence e they are true.
@tharon_pleiades @mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 And over 80% of the Steele Dossier has turned out to be accurate.
@tharon_pleiades @mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 Yes I do, and that is an unfounded accusation without evidence.
@tharon_pleiades @mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 Wow, talk about going high and right.
@tharon_pleiades @mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 Don't you think we should let the investigation run its course, publish or make known it's findings first, then decide if it's as or not?  You say no evidence and I say look at the indictments and the guilty.  No evidence? I thought this was a serious discussion.  C'mon man.
@tharon_pleiades @mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 Why is that coming up now?  Roger Stone is that you!
@tharon_pleiades @mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 Two wrongs don't cancel each other out.  All situations aren't equal weight even though all may be wrong. Equivocating is saying that Waters encouraging social protest in the manner she did is not right is the same as intimidating a witness in a federal case. It's not.
@tharon_pleiades @mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 First, I don't support that either.  Second she was talking about protesting over policies.  Third, she didn't single out a major witness in a current DoJ investigation. Fifth it may be fruit too, but that don't make apples oranges. Six, go back to first.
@siliconopolitan @Popehat @mattgaetz Irrelevant to the congressman's behavior.
@tharon_pleiades @mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 I would also add that he was given the chance to walk it back and didn't take it.  Instead he raised.  He knows he is threatening.  He doesn't think he will suffer consequences and he is unabashedly threatening.
@tharon_pleiades @mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 A beating is a beating.  The mob does that to intimidate everyone whether they testify or not.  This is another form of public flogging.
@tharon_pleiades @mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 Giving a witness a heads up warning that "we will exposed you as unfaithful to your wife for coming here," is a threat.
@tharon_pleiades @mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 No fair typing while I'm typing!  (Just kidding).  It might not be as much a threat as a figurative beating designed to make him clam up.  Intimidation.  It's not just a threat towards Cohen but anyone cooperating with or thinking about cooperating with Mueller. Do it and pay.
@tharon_pleiades @mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 If someone said that and then followed through, even if what the exposed was false with it would still put him and his family through the meat grinder.  It's a threat.  It may be 60 in a 55, but, that is a threat.
@tharon_pleiades @mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 Yes, it's a threat.  And he said on TV, "we'll see how honest he is with his family tomorrow" threat.  Past behavior.
@tharon_pleiades @mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 I apologise for not recognizing you agree with me.  :-).  If you drive 60mph in a 55mph zone, most often, you'll get away with it.  It's still speeding. This was a congressman communicating a threat then making more threats over tomorrow in a 30 second statement in front of news.
@tharon_pleiades @mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 The problem is that it doesn't matter who you are equivocating about.  If we agree that the Geatz tweet is  between inappropriate and criminal then saying, "but they do it too" is not justification for Gaetz threatening Cohen's family.  Two wrongs don't cancel each other out.
@WillRabbe @MalcolmNance @NBCNews Cryptic?  This wasn't cryptic or vague. This was a threat, it was clear.  It was clearly directed at the Cohen family.  How is this a "cryptic" tweet?
@tharon_pleiades @mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 Nice equivocating. Mueller and the FBI acting like law enforcement is not witness tampering. House dems holding hearings is not tampering.  Making a direct threat to a witness and his family a day before he testifies is not cross examination. It's threatening a witness.
@tharon_pleiades @mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 I'm not a lawyer either and there is no doubt in my mind that this is a threat, that it is aimed at Cohen specifically and, mirrors threats already made by 45.  I also have difficulty fathoning any reason to make such a statement if it's not a threat made to get him to shut up.
@tharon_pleiades @mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 Good point.I do take that into account, and, lean towards a person who admitted he lied,and what he lied about, instead of a person who lies multiple times a day and, even when caught contradicting himself, denies it. How believable Cohen is doesn't justify Gaetz threatening him.

What material evidence there is and who's testimony supports the witness. Cohen isn't the first defendant to change his plea in order to avoid jail time.  And Geatz isn't the first to tamper.
@B52Malmet No way! He's the stuff that comes out of an asshole.

@thedailybeast What a piece of 100% grade A humanoid fecal matter! Yes, this your elected congressman acting like an ass, threatening a witness on social media before he testifies, under oath to Congress(anything to pay for the kompromat eh congrssnan?) Why do this? I guess your people like it.

The state of American politics is like the flawed voting system for DWTS and American Idol. It encourages splintering and resentment. We have Trump people and kasich peps.  We Have Bernie followers and HRC disciples.When they lose, they are bitter and angry. How do we go forward?
When it comes to the Democratic party, I fail to grasp why it is so important to tear down democratic allies and opponents in the way they are attacking Bernie, Amy K and D. F.  If the country really wants to come together.  1 man, 1 vote, in the primary, vote for who you want.
@McFaul Check the label. If it says "made in China" this is not so true.  If it says made in USA, then, check the company.  If the have a history ou using under paid illegal aliens forced to work for low wages with no benefits, still not true (at least nothing anyone should be proud of).
@cmclymer It's a malignancy within the Democratic party that turns its destructive non democratic forces inward in attempts to eviscerate itself.  If ultimately the country needs to practice big partisan unity to heal the country, how do we get there with this self destructive bejavior?

@KenFWA @GreenMawnstah @LisaRSmith11 @DrDenaGrayson And kenFWA, according to Harvard studies (see Chow) decriminalizing prostitution INCREASES illegal human trafficking, violent crime and victimization.		Statistics collected from a DOJ report in human trafficking also supports the fact that decriminalization makes problems worse.
@KenFWA @GreenMawnstah @LisaRSmith11 @DrDenaGrayson Well, I'm not sure about that, but it does prove: if you start out with a nutty premise you will wind up with a goofy conclusion.  Making something legal has nothing to do with the impact on those involved in it. brothels not spring up on street corner does not change its role.

@CaseyPHudson @tutlax44 @Oddly_Thing @Mimirocah1 @TheRickWilson So the issue is why are the being bigots and misogynists. There should be no problem with someone recognizing the dignity of others.

@CaseyPHudson @tutlax44 @Oddly_Thing @Mimirocah1 @TheRickWilson I think the concept is that mimi was evoking political correctness, and that concept is why trump is in the White House.  I object because I think the entire "political correctness arguement" is a mythological red herring.  Protecting Human dignity is not a political gamecard.

@SenCortezMasto @SenateDems @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan Look at what the DoJ and Homeland Security are trying to do to DACAs as they debate the budget?  Time to solve these problems?  More time for Trump and the GOP to make them go away by deportation, eroding funding &amp; slight of hand politics.
We don't need a majority or a super-majority to solve the shutdown. We need a Veto-Proof majority backing a bill that cares for children, pays the military, saves DACA, before the DoJ deports them, and find funding for disaster relief. GOP decides, Trump or the People? Pick one.
Has anyone been paying attention?  What is the DoJ doing to DACAs now?  What happened to Disaster Relief?  Why hasn't the GOP scheduled a vote to save CHIP?  Approve a CR and anything not in the bill will continue to be attacked until it is dead.
