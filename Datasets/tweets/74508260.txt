Like clockwork, Republicans today blocked our attempt to shine sunlight on Trump‚Äôs chaotic policy-making. Under @HouseGOP, our oversight powers are covered with dust and cobwebs, untouched since Jan 19, 2017. Americans deserve a Congress that does its job.

After years of apocalyptic deficit rhetoric, @HouseGOP never believed any of it. In his 1st year, Trump has exploded our deficit to pay for giant tax cuts for his friends and big corporations. Who's going to pick up the check? You -- via cuts to Social Security, Medicare, &amp; more. https://t.co/a89Ph2j6Tr

Trump is full of it. This is a pack of fabrications, read off a script, told by a liar. How stupid does he think Americans are? Reciting from some notes won't undue the catastrophic damage from yesterday and the last 18 months. This man is unfit to lead. https://t.co/ooM9WAETzB

In a 51-49 chamber, one member of @SenateGOP could effectively heed the call of history. Members of @HouseGOP could draw a line in the sand. It‚Äôs put up or shut up time.
But even after today‚Äôs events, not a single Republican in Congress has demanded oversight. Not one! All I‚Äôve seen so far are statements too weak to rustle a feather from the ground. It is an affront. It is an embarrassment.
And today, the FBI arrested a Russian spy on American soil who worked closely with the NRA to support Trump‚Äôs campaign. The case for Russian interference is closed in the affirmative. The case for collusion only grows.
After today‚Äôs revolting display in Finland, Congress must commence oversight hearings and stop attacking law enforcement. We could explore the extent of ties between Trump‚Äôs business empire &amp; Russia with @HouseGOP demanding the Trump tax returns. #CongressMustRequest
The duplicitous event we just saw is nothing less than a sell-out to a dictator. Standing next to Putin, Trump attacked a free press, our intelligence services, &amp; Democrats. It is a low moment in US history. At long last, will any members of @HouseGOP show decency &amp; speak up?
The #GOPTaxScam was never about anything except lining the pockets of big corporations and the top 1%. It has not created jobs as promised by Trump and has led to falling wages, stock buybacks, and rampant offshoring. https://t.co/kW762OYyGq
And as Trump &amp; his associates keep lying about their Russia ties, I read the #SteeleDossier into the Congressional Record to set the facts straight. Americans deserve to know the truth. Watch here. https://t.co/XTVsYOEzHA
Today‚Äôs indictments show us again the extent of Russia‚Äôs toxic meddling. Trump shouldn‚Äôt be within a time zone of seeing Putin. Instead of kowtowing to the dictator, Trump should be demanding he hand over the indicted men who violated our sovereignty.
While history will be the final judge on these matters, what I am reading aloud are some of the allegations which we know have been proven. Please watch my speech. We must get to the truth, whatever it may be.
Partisans may dismiss the dossier as ‚Äúfake news,‚Äù but they know that several allegations in this document have been verified. Not a single thing of substance in the report has been disproven.
And so, to ensure the American people and future congresses know how we got here today, I am reading the Trump‚ÄìRussia dossier, also known as the Christopher Steele dossier on the House floor, and entering its entirety into the Congressional Record for all time.
All the while, Trump continues to praise Putin as ‚Äúfine people.‚Äù He ignores his illegal annexation of Crimea, his meddling in Ukraine, his murder of journalists and dissidents, his support of Assad, and his violation of our national sovereignty in the 2016 elections.
Over his life, Trump has shown an eagerness to skirt boundaries of ethics &amp; law. He has consorted w/mafia figures. His sons have bragged about their dependence on Russian cash. His finances are unknown as his tax returns remain hidden. In short, he is a prime blackmail target.
While it is possible the list of campaign contacts, policy positions, &amp; fawning Putin statements have an innocuous explanation, there is a simpler reason: has Trump been covertly influenced by Russia? @HouseGOP refuses to investigate, content w/fishing expeditions like today.
And as we‚Äôre seeing this week at NATO, Trump continues to snub our allies &amp; parrot Putin‚Äôs version of world events. He disregards the input of our civil servants, intelligence operatives, &amp; military officials. This betrayal has become an inexplicable routine we cannot shrug off.
As we saw in today‚Äôs hearing, @HouseGOP continues to heap falsehood after falsehood to cloud reality. Trump &amp; those closest to him have repeatedly lied about their multiple contacts w/Russian officials &amp; Putin associates. Even now they have yet to offer a consistent explanation.
After today‚Äôs outrageous hearing in the Judiciary Committee, I just arrived on the House floor to set the record straight on Russia and the Steele dossier. I‚Äôm going to read the dossier into the Congressional Record. https://t.co/XKDoJzXULl

Despite our differences, we all share those dreams. Today, let's be united by that common dedication. Happy Fourth!
Our Founders understood that this brand of freedom and democracy takes diligence and meticulous maintenance. Liberty has many enemies, and its preservation is hard work. July 4th is an occasion to mark that work, and dream of the promise yet unfulfilled...
Every Fourth of July is a celebration. When you make it to your 242nd birthday, it's a special thing. Ours is an experiment that was meant to last, forged on charity, ingenuity, fierce independence, and plain hard work...
I have been discharged and am enjoying my 4th of July at home with family. I hope my experience can serve as a reminder for everyone to drink plenty of water in this oppressive heat wave!
Thanks for all your concern, support, and well wishes. If you have to suffer from heat exhaustion anywhere, make it a firehouse. I deeply appreciate all the assistance from our first responders.

.@realDonaldTrump has proven to be an unreliable negotiating partner, even going back on his word with members of his own party.
However, no action was taken in the House to pass the bill. Further, @POTUS and his staff‚Äôs disrespectful and inflammatory rhetoric attacking both innocent children of immigrants and Democratic members of Congress does not lend itself to a constructive bipartisan deal.
While Senate Leadership made a verbal commitment for a vote, the House Speaker has not agreed to keep the promise made to DREAMers. Let‚Äôs not forget that the DREAM Act passed the Senate in 2013 as part of comprehensive immigration reform with strong bipartisan support.
Congressional Republicans have been too focused on passing irresponsible tax cuts - including today‚Äôs misguided delay of the medical device tax - to tackle critical issues like community health centers, disaster relief, and finding a permanent solution for DREAMers.
We cannot continue to threaten pay and benefits, critical services, and economic stability of fellow Americans because of dysfunction among members of the White House and Congress.
I want the federal government open for business, but today‚Äôs continuing resolution is only another short-term patch that does not solve the impasse. Congress must do its job and come to a long-term solution to keep our government open.
Q: Do furloughed federal employees get back pay after #TrumpShutdown?		That is up to the Congress and White House. The precedent has been that furloughed employees are later paid, through enactment of legislation. For example, that was done in the most recent shutdown in 2013.
Q: Which federal employees keep working during the #TrumpShutdown?		Federal agencies are required to classify their employees as either ‚Äúessential‚Äù or ‚Äúnon-essential‚Äù during a shutdown, with ‚Äúnon-essential‚Äù employees (800,000 designated in 2013 shutdown) put on unpaid furlough.
Q: What is the impact of the #TrumpShutdown on food safety activities?		During shutdown, the FDA is unable to support the majority of its food safety activities. The 2013 shutdown sharply curtailed critical FDA food safety inspections of domestic &amp; international food facilities.
Q: What is the impact on the Centers for Disease Control?		During shutdown, CDC has to greatly curtail its activities to conduct flu season surveillance &amp; monitoring, promote immunization, support state &amp; local health depts &amp; update disease treatment &amp; prevention recommendations.
Q: What is the impact on medical research?		During shutdown, NIH shuts down most medical research taking place, prevents the enrollment of patients in NIH Clinical Center studies, and stops reviewing medical research grant applications and making or renewing research grants.
Q: What is the impact on federal housing loans?		During shutdown, the Federal Housing Administration stops processing applications for housing loans. In 2013 shutdown, FHA delayed 500+ applications to develop, rehabilitate or refinance ~80,000 units of multifamily rental housing.
Q: What is the impact of the #TrumpShutdown on small businesses?		The shutdown halts federal loans to small businesses, stops review of applications for small businesses to obtain loans and loan guarantees (typically $1 billion/month).
Q: Will military personnel be paid?		@washingtonpost reports no gap in pay unless shutdown lasts past Feb. 1, and otherwise military continues working unpaid until shutdown ends or until Congress &amp; @POTUS agree to cover their costs.
Q: What is the impact of the #TrumpShutdown on U.S. military personnel?		Defense Department issued guidance, saying, ‚ÄúMilitary personnel on active duty, including reserve component personnel on federal active duty, will continue to report for duty and carry out assigned duties.‚Äù
Q: What is the impact of the #TrumpShutdown on veterans‚Äô services?		All VA medical facilities &amp; clinics will remain fully operational. However, VA call centers &amp; hotlines cease to function, and Veterans Benefits Administration public contact services are not available.
Q: How will the #TrumpShutdown affect FEMA clean-up efforts?		It‚Äôs unclear how ongoing FEMA recovery efforts (TX, FL, CA, PR &amp; VI) will be impacted. FEMA staff would still respond to emergencies, but the administration has not clarified status of long-term projects.
Q: Will I still be able to visit the national parks during the #TrumpShutdown?		During the 2013 shutdown, national parks, monuments &amp; the Smithsonian museums were closed. However, the administration announced it will work to keep parks ‚Äúas accessible as possible‚Äù during shutdown.
Q: Will my mail still arrive during the #TrumpShutdown?		Yes. The approximately 500,000 Postal Service employees are exempt from furlough because the Postal Service is self-funded.
Q: Will I continue to receive my Social Security and SSI checks during the #TrumpShutdown?		During a government shutdown, recipients will continue to receive their Social Security and SSI checks. However, a shutdown suspends the issuance of Social Security cards.
Questions about the #TrumpShutdown? I have answers. üëâ https://t.co/wjDMlHFayZ

@POTUS This type of injustice cannot continue. I will continue to fight for these hard-working, tax-paying young Americans who the Trump Administration decided to turn their back on.
I remain opposed to @POTUS decision to place nearly 800,000 young immigrants‚Äô lives in limbo. This decision tears apart families and continues to fan anti-immigrant sentiment across our country.

It takes a lot of chutzpah to make the centerpiece of your bill a trillion-dollar cut in health benefits to fund a tax cut for the rich.
This bill jeopardizes ACA protection for the 150 million Americans with employer coverage with a ban on annual and lifetime caps.
Their legislation also guts essential health benefits, allowing insurers to offer bare-bones plans that don‚Äôt provide meaningful care.
With astonishing dishonesty, @HouseGOP forever signed their name to legislation that removes protections for pre-existing conditions.

Entering complex civil war, @POTUS must inform Congress &amp; the American people about strategic plans, goals &amp; views on Syrian regime change.

No wonder @POTUS and @HouseGOP chose to ram this plan through the @WaysMeansCmte in the pre-dawn hours. #RxForDisaster #PayMoreForLess
It's not a serious health policy proposal, but a tax cut for wealthiest and corporations on the backs of the middle-class and low-income.
Rs #PayMoreForLess plan "substantially" raises premiums on seniors, slashes $880B in Medicaid &amp; leads to "increasing out-of-pocket costs."
.@USCBO tells us that 24 MILLION will lose health coverage in the Republican #RxForDisaster, especially seniors, the disabled and kids.

I will not stop pressing this issue as long as the President's business interests continue to present potential conflicts for America.
America wants full scope of @POTUS business interests &amp; be assured that he is not taking foreign emoluments as outlawed by our Constitution.
To minimize this request by calling it ‚Äòrummaging‚Äô is the height of chutzpah.
Three years ago, @RepKevinBrady voted with @HouseGOP in committee to release confidential tax information of 51 taxpayers. Same provision.

It seems like President Trump needs a history lesson to understand what truly makes America great. It was immigrants, like my grandparents.
The actions President Trump took today unfortunately come as no surprise¬†given that¬†he kicked off his campaign by slurring Mexican people.
Raising fear in immigrants to the point that they would be unwilling to interact with local law enforcement? Dangerous.
Bowing down to the extreme nativist, anti-immigrant members of the Republican Party? Shameful.

Was proud to join @repsandylevin in passing H.Res.50 last year condemning the imprisonment of Savchenko and calling for her release.

Nadiya Savchenko is a symbol of Ukrainian pride + strength. Her unlawful detention violation of international agreements. #FreeSavchenko
