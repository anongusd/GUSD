The “compromise” bill increases spending &amp; includes several nonsensical provisions that could potentially threaten public safety. Not to mention the fact that we were given less than 24 hours to read a 1169-page bill. This is just typical Washington politics &amp; I can’t support it.

Our debt is over $17 trillion and we’re already spending at an unsustainable rate, and yet Obama will ask for more spending. #SOTU
The President says that jobs are a priority, but his policies (over-regulation, Obamacare, taxing and spending) are killing jobs. #SOTU
Instead of picking and choosing which laws to enforce based on his personal agenda, the President needs to work with Congress. #SOTU
Obama will call for more executive action in #SOTU. This unconstitutional abuse of power undermines our system of checks and balances.
