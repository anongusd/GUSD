@TheWrightWingv2 @AFreespeechzone @New_Keith / Zimmerman's admission of following Trayvon and shooting him is relevant evidence.

@JoeMGoldner / I don't mind debating you but just imagine if u were tracked like a criminal by a wannabe cop, while  minding your own biznez
@JoeMGoldner /  He defended himself.  Zimmerman saw Trayvon doing nothung wrong.  He acted like Barney Fife.
@JoeMGoldner / GZ should have stayed at home; he wouldn't have gotten in trouble.  GZ managed to kill a person who was doing nothing wrong.
@Tompete1 / Zimmerman had nothing legitimate to report.  He was acting like a gung-ho wannabe cop.
@TheWrightWingv2 @AFreespeechzone @New_Keith / Not a valid reason to call 911 &amp; stalk someone.
@TheWrightWingv2 @AFreespeechzone @New_Keith /  What if it was?
@Hankin57 @TheWrightWingv2 @AFreespeechzone @New_Keith / Watch for illegal activity....only Barney Fife would think walking is suspicious.

@TheWrightWingv2 @AFreespeechzone @New_Keith /  What was suspicious?  Besides, GZ did far more than report.  He tried to be Rambo.
@AFreespeechzone @TheWrightWingv2 @New_Keith /  The jury was wrong.  Just like OJ Simpson case and Casey Anthony case.

@JoeMGoldner / What illegal action did Martin committ, that caused Zimmerman to stalk Martin?  Nothing!  Z'man was delusional......
@SarahPalinLinks @SarahPalinUSA /  C'mon, Z did kill Martin.  Z tried to stalk Martin, so Martin had right to react against Z.
@Goodolds /  If Z would not have stalked Martin then Z would not have gotten his ass whipped.
@DMashak / Now that he does know, heads should roll, right?
@PatDollard /  Why did Z need to tell cops where Martin was located?  Martin was not doing anything illegal.  Z was acting inappropriately.
Zimmerman convicted Martin when Z decided Martin was acting suspicious &amp; stalked him without authority.  Z'man is guilty guilty guilty.
