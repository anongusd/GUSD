@MichelePistey @LoriB0613 @PressSec No, republicans need to learn how to cooperate and how to concede just a tiny little bit.    Who is paying for that effing wall?  Mexico?   Yeah really?  and you want US to say yes to #GOPwall?  Billions of dollars?  NO!   FFS!
@RepMcKinley @SenateDems Oh no ya don't.  Five republicans, your party, wouldn't even vote for the mess the GOP created.  Gop owns all aspects of power here.   No blaming the MINIORITY in this mess.  Own it.  #GOPshutdown #trumpshutdown
@KeithRothfus @SenateDems Sorry even 5 of your own wouldn't vote for this mess.  It's on the GOP and trump.   #gopshutdown #trumpshutdown   Gop controls all aspects and yet held hostage CHIP and children.  Sickening.
@dagsteel @LoriB0613 @PressSec Perhaps you should address the Republicans that voted against this...there were 5 of them...so....hey, no...STILL on Republicans and #trumpshutdown.
Yep, lets watch what the #gopshutdown and the #trumpshutdown does.  		 "A shutdown falls on the President's lack of leadership. He can't even control his party and get people together in a room. A shutdown means the President is weak"		-Donald J. Trump 2013 about Obama https://t.co/hHH8ZAj79p
