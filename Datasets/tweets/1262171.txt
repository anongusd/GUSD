Apparently Science represents GROUP THINK according to Riggleman.
@Acosta Where is the sad face on Twitter? :(
Riggleman also says he's a "free, independent thinker" but plans to join the Freedom Caucus. Good luck with keeping that "free, independent thinking". It's pretty clear he doesn't know much about how the Freedom Caucus operates.
Watching the 5th district debate tonight. Riggleman says managing climate change is good, as long as it doesn't risk jobs. So I guess he's pro-coal.

OK, back to solving real search challenges. Thanks, FB for not so much this past hour.
@MichelleRobbins Sort of a misnomer, really, to call it "Social".
@jaredmckiernan haha!
RT @robgarner: In light of media interest in #graphsearch, Diane Sawyer is doing a lead story on G+'s Author Graph tonight on ABC World  ...
If #Facebook can't answer the question, it will turn to #Bing. #graphsearch
@MichelleRobbins LOL. So true. Exactly the feeling I'm getting. And, don't I know my friends pretty well anyways?

RT @mattmcgee: Exactly. RT @MikeIsaac: Graph Search = the sort of thing Google WANTS to accomplish with Search Plus Your World
@robgarner Agreed.
@LisaBarone @graywolf @SimonHeseltine Agreed.
RT @mattmcgee: Folks, Facebook doesn‚Äôt need to beat google at search &amp; almost surely never will. It only needs to keep people using  ...
OK, here's where this gets interesting. Bing partnership. #graphsearch

OK, "game changer" now being used in reference to #graphsearch. Please, stop the insanity.
@TonyVerre I know. So lame! Everyone wants to be the first to post, and  then they have a bunch of garbage to post. Ugh.
RT @CNETNews: You can sign up to get on the Graph Search wait list here: http://t.co/pGVIQ4Hl
The saddest part about all of this is there will be a million people now talking about how this competes with Google. #Not #graphsearch
Initial thoughts: #graphsearch is helpful if you have a TON of Facebook friends, especially if they're not your friends IRL.
So far, this new search looks mostly like a way to filter friend information. #NotAGoogleKillerByFar

I'm not seeing what is so great about the #Facebook Social Graph Search. Find out what your friends like? How about be social and ASK?
@AlanBleiweiss You're not feeling well? Get better soon!
@netmeg Because it's new and shiny. That's why. :)
RT @tonynwright: I thought Zuckerberg was going to announce a Facebook phone...Oh well. Another search engine to optimize for. #jobsecurity
@dannysullivan - Glad he was joking on that filters slide. I about had a coronary when you posted that. LOL.
Graph search based on filters and privacy settings. #Facebook
Web search is great, Facebook isn't same. "Web search is designed to take any open ended query &amp; return links related" #Facebook

Good NFL commercial!!
Love it when the Super Bowl is actually a close game.
@sajego I think you may be right, and that's going to really backfire on them.
You can blame Groupon's ad agency, but someone at Groupon approved that ad. How can so many people be so wrong? Goodness.
RT @sajego: RT @datachick: Tried to delete my Groupon account. They aren't allowing login #sbxlv #Convenient  http://twitpic.com/3xa24j
RT @BuzzEdition: ‚ñ∫I guess Groupon decided to do a funny commercial about Tibet b/c Darfur would be in bad taste? via @BorowitzReport
@benkepes Yeah... will be interesting to see their stats tomorrow!
@benkepes But how many unsubscribes and retailer withdrawal will it cost them in the meantime? #groupon #superbowl
@benkepes Disagree... if the talk is mostly negative, it can't be good for groupon. #groupon #superbowl
RT @slhamlet: That Groupon commercial may actually inspire the Dalai Lama to give up a lifetime of non-violence to kick the CEO in the nuts.
Fergie's outfit was odd too. Tried to look like football pads with sparkles. Not a good look.
Feeling I may do the same: RT @BarbaraNixon: I wonder how many others will follow suit? RT @jakrose: Unsubscribing from Groupon #brandbowl
You know what's just as fun as tweeting during a football game? Tweeting with other marketers about the ads during the #superbowl.
Nice ad by Chrysler. Nice choice in Eminem for that too.
Agreed. Ad caught my attention, but poor taste: RT @stephstad: Unsolicited advice for @Groupon: fire your ad agency. #brandbowl #groupon
RT @GlobalGiving: Didn't love @Groupon's #superbowl ad? We have lots of ways you can help Tibet: http://bit.ly/dSFReg
Does anyone really find Adrian Brody sexy? Missed the mark on that one
Never have really liked Carmax's commercials. Tonight just confirmed that again.
@KateMorris FYI: RT @gregjarboe: Watch  HomeAway SuperBowl commercial on YouTube at http://www.youtube.com/adblitz/?x=k24N5DQ_XaY
OUCH. Test baby. LOL.
LMAO: RT @AmberCadabra: RT @darthvader: That half time show did more to crush the morale of the rebellion in 30 minutes than I ever did.

Agreed! RT @joshchambers: Wish the Volkswagen Vader ad would have been the long version. That ad is fantastic: http://j.mp/dIppUl #brandbowl
Not sure that the Super Bowl crowd "gets" Bieber. #Fail
Man I love the eTrade baby.
Agreed: RT @vankayak: Fergie's impression of Adam Sandler's impression of Axl Rose was brought to you by "The Most Terrible Thing Ever".
