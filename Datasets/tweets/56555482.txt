Yes! (1) Is @tasbnews saying it supports a property tax decrease, if so how much?? (2) More likely, @tasbnews wants more spending st the state and local level.

@ImTheQ @CognitaVagabond @daxgonzalez @tasbnews @RoundRockISD @TexasTribune Yes. Your thought is that recapture should be paid to public schools (which it is), but ALSO so should lots more state tax $$ from business and families.

@vessacory @TPPF I do all the same things, but I serve on a charity board. Please go look at Literacy First!  We ENSURE 2,000 low income kids read at grade level each year in central Texas!
Yes! Hardworking #families and #businesses are putting billions of $ into pub ed. We are spending approx. $220k on EVERY CLASSROOM each year! More $ is not the answer, a strong focus on student outcomes and paying our best teachers more the answer. #txlege #txed @TPPF #PO2019 https://t.co/2NZpFRVI7O
@emilyjsass @TPPF #PO2019 - So inspiring to hear about our amazing Valley Schools and @IDEAschools that are achieving incredible results for children from poor families!  They do it within existing taxpayer $. We need to replicate their work statewide. #txlege #txed @dallasnew
@vessacory @TPPF @dallasnews @statesman @86thLegislature @TexasTribune @TexasHouse And offer our children as many school choices as possible so their parents are empower for them to grow into the people they are meant to be and reach their full potential.  That is very hard to have happen in a D or F traditional public school where they are not learning.
@vessacory @TPPF @dallasnews @statesman @86thLegislature @TexasTribune @TexasHouse I do all of this and much, much more!  Go look at Literacy First, the Board I serve on and support financially. See the many lives Literacy First changes in Texas traditional public schools.
@vessacory @TPPF @dallasnews @statesman @86thLegislature @TexasTribune @TexasHouse Free to the family guaranteed options? Hardly, the only free option would be a nearby charter school, but the child can only get in if they are lucky enough to “win the lottery.” Otherwise, the child must depend on the very district they are assigned to is failing them already.
@vessacory @TPPF @dallasnews @statesman @86thLegislature @TexasTribune @TexasHouse Really? So children trapped in failing D and F schools can attend a nearby amazing private school at no cost to the family? Or do they have to go to a school in the very same district that is already failing them? #knowthetruth
@vessacory @TPPF Government assigns 650k TX children - more than 1 in 10 - to schools rated D or F, often with no choice!  Is this okay? Their futures are literally at stake. Then school districts use taxpayer $ to lobby for more $, no options, &amp; less transparency for parents. #txlege #txed

@vessacory @TPPF @dallasnews @statesman @86thLegislature @TexasTribune @TexasHouse That’s great. Do you think children assigned to D and F schools - there are 650k of them or 1 in 10 TX kids - should be assigned and stuck there with NO option?  Not even another school with better results? There futures are at stake!

@pastors4txkids @JamesQuinteroTX @antraasa @TAMSATX @RYHTexas @williamstodd78 The BEST academic assessment of a kid is NOT those things. What matters to a kid is whether they can READ!  A dedicated, well paid teacher that is NOT effective and does not teach, is not what they need. Effective teachers, assessment &amp; transparency in results gets kids reading.
@pastors4txkids @KendallGPace @JamesQuinteroTX @antraasa @TAMSATX @RYHTexas @williamstodd78 Civil rights for poor children is making sure they read and do math by grade level. Period!

FL - a state doing better than any other - requires “grade level” and has many more choice options.

@vessacory @antraasa @JamesQuinteroTX @TasB @Tasa @teainfo @TAMSATX @GovAbbott @testsensejt You are critiquing a public school principal working with a tough student population that took a school from an F to a B and is tracking to get an A. She loves kids. Have you turned around a similar school? How did you do it, since this principal’s work is not to your standards?
@vessacory @TasB @Tasa It is interesting to me you are criticizing the ideas of a principal credited with turning around a public school from a F to a B with an extremely tough student population. Tell me, have you turned around a similar school?
@vessacory @TasB @Tasa Do you want to visit the school and principal? It is getting amazing results with very tough student population. Do you want to meet the principal and hear how she has turned a school around? Very effective. Do you support public school educators?
@vessacory @antraasa @JamesQuinteroTX @TasB @Tasa @teainfo @TAMSATX @GovAbbott @testsensejt We need to ensure all our children are reading at grade level. Prior to testing children, we had no data and poor children were often moved from grade to grade without being able to read.
@vessacory @TasB @Tasa It is one of the highest performing elementary schools teaching some the toughest children and gets utterly amazing results!  You should really visit and meet the principal!  She was specially recruited bc she is so fantastic. Let me know if you want to visit the school!

@hassettfive @TXParentPAC @PISDPTACouncil @starlocalmedia @Plano_Schools @MidlandISD @PlanoISDAlumni @cityofplanotx @DMNOpinion You are wrong about your understand of labels. Please go to TEA and see what approaching grade level vs. meets grade level means.
@hassettfive @TXParentPAC @PISDPTACouncil @starlocalmedia @Plano_Schools @MidlandISD @PlanoISDAlumni @cityofplanotx @DMNOpinion BTW . . . I was Deputy Commissioner at TEA and helped create the very labels you refer too. There is big difference between “approaching grade level” and “grade level” performance for the lives of our children.
@hassettfive @TXParentPAC @PISDPTACouncil @starlocalmedia @Plano_Schools @MidlandISD @PlanoISDAlumni @cityofplanotx @DMNOpinion Actually, you are the one started “insults” by trying to say I was “incorrect.” I always make sure my data is accurate and sourced. I am glad you would love to see children succeed. You seemed to argue that approaching grade level was good enough. That would be sad for TX kids.
@RatliffT @antraasa @JamesQuinteroTX @TasB @Tasa @teainfo @TAMSATX @GovAbbott @testsensejt Please help me!  I would love to present to Plano ISD!
@antraasa @RatliffT @JamesQuinteroTX @TasB @Tasa @teainfo @TAMSATX @GovAbbott @testsensejt Charters are open enrollment public schools! They get less funding than districts schools and generally have better results. Interestingly, most public schools get $12K, so according to you, money is not an issue. See https://t.co/PKxuhWUFcD.
@RatliffT @antraasa @JamesQuinteroTX @TasB @Tasa @teainfo @TAMSATX @GovAbbott @testsensejt Are you honestly saying that if parents were given the choice, most would choose an F school over an A school in their neighborhood?  Please show me the data that supports this! You are not speaking of the thousands of children in poor neighborhood sitting on charter waitlists!
@RatliffT @antraasa @JamesQuinteroTX @TasB @Tasa @teainfo @TAMSATX @GovAbbott @testsensejt So you are saying poor families should have to move to go to A or B schools?  Interesting! Can they afford their new homes? Will they be near their families, etc.?
@RatliffT @antraasa @JamesQuinteroTX @TasB @Tasa @teainfo @TAMSATX @GovAbbott @testsensejt Support norm referenced tests. Again, students are not assigned, without a choice, to a private school. That is not true for public schools. Students are assigned to F schools with no choice!

@hassettfive @TXParentPAC @PISDPTACouncil @starlocalmedia @Plano_Schools @MidlandISD @PlanoISDAlumni @cityofplanotx @DMNOpinion Wrong!  That is the number approaching grade level!  We want children at grade level, not just approaching. #KNOWLEDGE #data

@DeronR_EdLaw @IDEAschools @dallasschools Would you be okay if your child were assigned by their district to an F school were virtually no children were reading or doing math at grade level, including your own child? Would you want a choice to change schools?  #txlege
@DeronR_EdLaw @IDEAschools @dallasschools A little of both!  They are finally making some good decisions. They have pledged to no longer give across the board raises, identify and pay their best teachers more, and provide more options to families. But they also are still wasting tax $ on half full schools.
RT @VanceGinn: Rightfully so! #LetPeopleProsper #DontMessWithTexas https://t.co/SviEoYMfH7
@DeronR_EdLaw @IDEAschools @dallasschools Really?  Texas AFT says essentially there is no way to tell a good teacher from a bad. So all teachers have to be paid the exact same!! They fight hard against merit pay at state and local level. They also fight against innovation and high performing charters.
@DeronR_EdLaw @IDEAschools @dallasschools Would you add politics and school boards focusing on adults, and not kids, to that list?  Everyone knows it would be better for kids and taxpayers to close half full schools - instead of raising taxes - but politics get in the way, no?  Look up Dallas ISD.
@DeronR_EdLaw @IDEAschools @dallasschools I love to visit with people so direct mail me if you would like to meet.
@DeronR_EdLaw @IDEAschools @dallasschools Sure. While we dont have collective bargaining the Texas AFT, for example, exerts tremendous pressure &amp; opposes teacher merit programs. Like THE ONE in Dallas. They also claim we cannot determine who is a good teacher &amp; work to prevent ineffective teachers from being dismissed.
@DeronR_EdLaw @IDEAschools @dallasschools No, it is arbitrary. They can redraw their lines at anytime, have an open district to give families choice. Of course, they could also improve their D and F schools where children are trapped with no choice, not learning, while their futures are dying or partner with a charter.
@DeronR_EdLaw @IDEAschools @dallasschools Yes!  One method to improve things would be to stop teacher union backed across the board pay raises (which is what schools spend nearly all new tax money on) and start paying the best, effective teachers much more!
@DeronR_EdLaw @IDEAschools @dallasschools Schools districts arbitrarily draw district lines and children usually must attend the school they are assigned to. They have no choice. That is TX law. Do you want the TEA website?
@DeronR_EdLaw @IDEAschools @dallasschools Much of what is on google is untrue. I have actual facts and data from TEA that matches actual TX books. No propaganda. But please show me your source and verify it matches actual	State accounting systems.
@DeronR_EdLaw @IDEAschools @dallasschools You are totally wrong in these statements. Please provide evidence.
@DeronR_EdLaw @IDEAschools @dallasschools Also, do you agree the government should be able to arbitrarily assign 606k TX kids to failing schools were they are not learning with no choice?  Is this fair to these kids? If they were given a choice their lives might be changed!
@DeronR_EdLaw @IDEAschools @dallasschools It is not at all clear DISD needed more money.  It currently is funding many half filled schools - waste of tax $! Plus, it already spends more than state and regional average!  Plus, it has not taken advantage of district/charter partnership, etc.
@DeronR_EdLaw @IDEAschools @dallasschools Charter schools are free public schools held to the same standards as traditional public schools. They get less $$ (no facilities) and generally do better!  Also, TX schools can become districts of innovation, and adopt same rules as charters.
@DeronR_EdLaw @IDEAschools @dallasschools Look how much they accomplished with existing $! More $ if they closed half filled schools. Innovation, which has included new school options to meet family demand is finally happening. Leaders in #Dallas publically state #charters are making them do things differently!!
@DeronR_EdLaw I don’t claim to have expertise in school turn around, but the data shows there are plenty of leaders who can do it!  Look at results of @IDEAschools  or what happening in @dallasschools schools. #txlege
@JackBowles8 @TracyYoungTX @TCSAnews @TexasHouse So you would argue children assigned by their district to a D or F school where they are not learning should have no choice? 606k kids in TX sit in D &amp; F schools with their dreams and futures dying!
@rossramsey @TexasHouse @TexasTribune @AliyyaSwaby @quorumreport To be clear, some ARRA was to “help stabilize” formula funding. Billions more was just added to federal grants like Title I and IDEA. This was always understood to be one time federal $, and the decline should not count against TX. Especially without disclosure.
@rossramsey @TexasHouse @TexasTribune @AliyyaSwaby @quorumreport Yes! One-time ARRA is included and not disclosed in the federal column!  The federal column is then used to calculate a misleading 2010-2019 cost basis decline. In fact, any “federal” change impacts the TX numbers. But TX does not control federal spending!!
@rossramsey @TexasHouse @TexasTribune @AliyyaSwaby @quorumreport The problem remains &amp; as I said in my testimony: (1) nobody knows what 2009-11 would have been the absense of ARRA, (2) ARRA was billions in NON FORMULA, one-time federal for TitleI/IDEA, state should NOT replace (3) ARRA was NOT even disclosed on chart - Misleading taxpayers.

@AggiEmo76 @VanceGinn @TPPF @dallasnews "State share" includes recapture in some charts. In some charts recapture is counted in state share, in some in local, and in some broken out. In these tweets, we always get to the same place. Go look. You want more $ for schools, but you will not agree to new tax or explain how. https://t.co/cw2EVaVDU8

@AggiEmo76 @VanceGinn @TPPF @dallasnews Also, the very same taxpayers that pay a lot in sales taxes collected by the "state." Sales taxes are the number 1 GR revenue source for pub ed. So when you say you want state to pay more, you are saying you want massive state tax increase? What income tax? Business tax?
@AggiEmo76 @VanceGinn @TPPF @dallasnews Sorry. Not remotely how this works, and IS NOT a reason why elections should be held in May and not Nov. In fact, many big bond elections are in Nov. I think taxpayers will be voting on several billion in bonds this Nov. There are just lots of strange one in May or June often.
@AggiEmo76 @VanceGinn @TPPF @dallasnews Thats part of the problem. IT IS all tax $$. State share or local share, still taxes, right?

@AggiEmo76 @VanceGinn @TPPF @dallasnews Yes, TEA followed the Comptroller’s lead and standard tax practice. If tax is collected and disbursed at state level on state books, it is state tax. But they also routinely break recapture out. See earlier tweet.
@AggiEmo76 @VanceGinn @TPPF @dallasnews Yep. https://t.co/F1JT1k81hx and the Texas Education Agency. What sources would you rely on? Sure they are not biased/ #FakeNews https://t.co/r6AJPnw8sh
@AggiEmo76 @VanceGinn @TPPF @dallasnews No much about NAEP?? This is the Nation's Report Card! Big stuff! It is only on 4th and 8th grade math and reading and we teach more hispanics than any other state and as a percent of our student population. This is actually remarkable data! Look at disadvantaged students. https://t.co/oAW7ZPzZCk
@AggiEmo76 @VanceGinn @TPPF @dallasnews On a disaggregated basis we do really good in math. There is a strong case that Texas is getting better results in many areas with less $$. That said, nearly ALL states need to drastically raise student results including Texas. https://t.co/sQreXpJxG3
@AggiEmo76 @VanceGinn @TPPF @dallasnews Why don't we #tax #texans like crazy and spend lots of money like NJ, NY, CA and get even worse student results. Our goal should be to be number one in taxes and spending? WRONG! https://t.co/hHwYclkC5s
@AggiEmo76 @VanceGinn @TPPF @dallasnews We are 40 in spending? Yes, yes, yes! Our goal should not be to spend as much as CA, NY and NJ which spend more and get even worse results for kids. Why would we want to tax like them? CA is moving to TX?

@AggiEmo76 @VanceGinn @TPPF @dallasnews That is not what the case said. Also, due to Robin Hood, #Texas is widely regarded as having one of the most equitable systems in the nation. Similar schools districts with similar students will have similar $$ per student. Only concern is CIE and no recapture on golden pennies.
#TexasDebate https://t.co/Q94Ucmft7t
@AggiEmo76 @VanceGinn @TPPF @dallasnews Agree. One reform would be to stop paying ineffective teachers the same amount as effective teachers.
@AggiEmo76 @VanceGinn @TPPF @dallasnews The only part that has been found unconstitutional in the last few cases was re: implementation of statewide property taxes. The system has been held constitutional on ALL other issues, adequacy, equity, $ amounts, testing, results, etc., for years.

@AggiEmo76 @VanceGinn @TPPF @dallasnews School buildings and their $30M per elementary school costs, after all, have nothing to do with schools or education, so it make tons of sense not to count those $$. Right? WRONG! Taxpayers often want those $$ counted.
@AggiEmo76 @VanceGinn @TPPF @dallasnews First, lots of these elections are on weird days in May to suppress the vote. Why not NOV? PLUS, the voters are often not told how much taxes will go up, how long debt will be outstanding, what the real cost of stadium after debt is, etc. We need ballot transparency
@AggiEmo76 @VanceGinn @TPPF @dallasnews Dallas ISD will likely be recaptured on its Copper pennies. It will get to keep very little of the tax $$ it is asking for in the district.

@AggiEmo76 @VanceGinn @TPPF @dallasnews A FAVORITE ridiculous argument is to say, "Well LET'S not count lots of $$ we are spending. Sure building schools and things costs a lot, but lets not count it." M&amp;O IS also locally approve above $1.04 up to $1.17 (max tax).

@VanceGinn @daisy_calico @dallasnews @TPPF Also, when the data shows a $1.5K difference per child (advantage Dallas),  then we start getting into COLA, etc. BUT the focus is and still remains that Dallas renters, homeowner, and business taxes are going up. Part of that money will go to ineffective teachers. Not good!
@VanceGinn @daisy_calico @dallasnews @TPPF Could not agree more with Vance!  My data is online and verified by TEA. I could argue that it costs a lot to educate kiddos on the border that my not have access to some benefits of living in Dallas. It is very hard for some border school districts to recruit teachers, etc.

@pennylowe @chuckazooloo @KIM4erteach @ShaneAlanHardin @teainfo As one budget expert to another, If business are paying more in taxes after a change in law that is called a tax increase. Please provide actual facts and figures.
@chuckazooloo @pennylowe @KIM4erteach @ShaneAlanHardin @teainfo @dallasschools A B bc it’s students are improving faster than similar districts with similar levels of poverty and it has amazing turn around in student results. Please see my op ed in Dallas morning news. Best!
@pennylowe @chuckazooloo @KIM4erteach @ShaneAlanHardin @teainfo @dallasschools I did not say raises should only go to STAAR teachers and that is not DISD program. My position is pay more to effective teachers. Please review extensive prior tweet record.

@pennylowe @chuckazooloo @KIM4erteach @ShaneAlanHardin @teainfo Please site data showing closing the loophole aka tax increase will raise $5B per year. That would be enough of a tax increase, in your opinion? That is massive 8% per year GR increase. Do you think it will discourage businesses from coming to Texas or folks will lose jobs?
@chuckazooloo @KIM4erteach @pennylowe @ShaneAlanHardin @teainfo Again. Please answer my questions. I am guessing to cover TRS we need an even bigger STATE tax increase, in your view?

@robgreer1 @VanceGinn @JustinBullock14 @tweetingtomh Please support your statements with actual data from the state Comptroller of Public Accounts.
@robgreer1 @VanceGinn @JustinBullock14 @tweetingtomh Wrong. TEA does show inflation line. Please see past tweets.
@chuckazooloo @pennylowe @KIM4erteach @ShaneAlanHardin Also, Texas STAAR test questions written and approved by TX teachers. Are you saying TX teachers don’t know what should be tested?
@ShaneAlanHardin Per usual, that mistakes my argument. My argument is STATE should go down when local increases or taxpayers (who are all the same) should not have massive increases at both levels.
@WhistleForTxEd Please answer question. You say we need $2K * 5.3M Students per year or $10B. How does state get it tax families, businesses or slash Medicaid. Please answer the real hard question.
@SchlFinance101 @TXProChild @claire4texas @teainfo @TPPF @TexasTribune @tasbnews @quorumreport @EquityCenter Not sure what decline you refer to funding overall and on per student basis is up. This is true of #LBB and #TEA data. Only argument is whether increase kept up with inflation.
@TXProChild @claire4texas @teainfo @TPPF @TexasTribune @tasbnews @quorumreport @SchlFinance101 @EquityCenter Not sure what you mean by formulas support facilities. STATE pays very little of the massive and unnecessary local school district debt load to build stadiums. STATE only helps very poor students.
@tweetingtomh Thanks and thanks for the supports and retweets!
@chuckazooloo @pennylowe @KIM4erteach @ShaneAlanHardin Actually smaller class sizes do not always equal better results. Effective teachers change results. A good teacher with 30 students is better than two poor teachers with 15.
@chuckazooloo @pennylowe @KIM4erteach @ShaneAlanHardin @CollierForTexas That is not true. Recapture as a % of the overall education budget has remained the same. We recapture no more and no less then ever before. Please review previous charts.
@KIM4erteach @pennylowe @ShaneAlanHardin @CollierForTexas That is not necessarily true. Local school district taxes are rising bc of rising local property values on many existing properties. Not bc new people moving in in some areas.
@WhistleForTxEd Please explain exactly what is wrong with actual proof from the CPA. Families and business pay property taxes. Families and businesses pay sales taxes. Education at state level is largely funded with sales taxes. Same tax payers.

@TXProChild @claire4texas @teainfo @TPPF @TexasTribune @tasbnews @quorumreport @SchlFinance101 @EquityCenter @ReecesPieces8 You are citing HuffPost? #fakenews Let's look at real data from Stanford experts. https://t.co/tsl1v8ASR1
@TXProChild @claire4texas @teainfo @TPPF @TexasTribune @tasbnews @quorumreport @SchlFinance101 @EquityCenter This article has many statements that are just wrong. For example, due to small size adjustment, small school districts get more funding in the formulas than large urban districts. Also, #LBB even says funding for pub ed is higher than in 2008. #FakeNews
@TXProChild @claire4texas @teainfo @TPPF @TexasTribune @tasbnews @quorumreport @SchlFinance101 @EquityCenter Many experts say more $ do NOT equal improved student results. It matters MUCH more how $ are spent. For example, most $ used for across the board, union backed teacher raises, that reward good teachers and bad teachers equally. Poor use of funds. 	#txlege #txed @TexasTribune https://t.co/wH2mFzfdQv
@TXProChild @claire4texas @teainfo @TPPF @TexasTribune @tasbnews @quorumreport @SchlFinance101 @EquityCenter @ReecesPieces8 National experts say Texas has one of the most equitable systems in the nation: similar schools, similar students = similar $. Only real things not equal = CIE, old hold harmless, $.04 no RobinHood. #txlege #txed https://t.co/mf1rJyedCi
@TXProChild @claire4texas @teainfo @TPPF @TexasTribune @tasbnews @quorumreport @SchlFinance101 @EquityCenter There is incredible evidence that $ do not matter. In fact, high spend states have worse results, aka Wyoming. What matters is spending $ wisely. For example, give good teachers pay raises, instead of costly across the board raises. 		https://t.co/ZJa8P39SPG https://t.co/GDnMLOpcLU

@WhistleForTxEd The same taxpayers (families and businesses) pay property taxes locally and sales taxes at state level. So when you say “state” does not contribute enough, you are arguing for increases in taxes on families and businesses. #txlege #txed
@WhistleForTxEd My credentials can be seen in my twitter account. But additionally, am CPA with law degree. My key concern has always been providing taxpayers and educators with all facts to make good decisions about spending.
@WhistleForTxEd (1) The increase is on a per pupil basis. In other words, population growth is funded and then some additional increase. (2) The same tax payers pay at the state (sales) and local (property) level. So we don’t want taxes up at both levels.
@ShaneAlanHardin @KIM4erteach @teainfo @quorumreport @TPPF @tasbnews @tasanet @TexasTribune @dallasnews @USNewsEducation Wrong. Please go review my past tweets. Based on TEA data through 2017, state share did not go down. LBB data - just released - said it went down for 2018/2019. I have said before even using #LBB data, state share went down less than 10% &amp; it should to avoid tax ratchet.
@ShaneAlanHardin Wrong. 1. I have said before if you use LBB charts and “estimates” state funds may have decreased. Go look. But I like TEA better. 2. BUT state should go down if local is rising to avoid tax ratchet scheme.
@pennylowe @KIM4erteach @ShaneAlanHardin State funding SHOULD have decreased. Otherwise, taxes are increasing for families and businesses at both the state and local level. That is unstainable for Texas!  More $ does not = better student results. #txlege #txed
@ShaneAlanHardin @pennylowe @KIM4erteach You do understand that local property taxpayers are also paying state sales tax. So if local taxes go up and state taxes go up, you are hurting same businesses and families? Where should state get $? State income tax or slash Medicaid? #txlege #txed
@claire4texas @teainfo @TPPF @TexasTribune @tasbnews @quorumreport There is little evidence from TEA or nation that more funding would improve student results. Some Valley schools spend low, are high poverty and get good student results. #txed #txlege
@ShaneAlanHardin @KIM4erteach @teainfo @quorumreport @TPPF @tasbnews @tasanet @TexasTribune @dallasnews @USNewsEducation Again, state contribution from taxpayers can and should go down when local taxes rise. Otherwise, there is tax ratchet scheme were SAME taxpayers pay more at STATE and LOCAL level. #txed #txlege
@claire4texas @teainfo @TPPF @TexasTribune @tasbnews @quorumreport Actually, funding is up on a per student basis, which means it includes population growth right in the calculation. #txlege #txed
@KIM4erteach @ShaneAlanHardin @teainfo @quorumreport @TPPF @tasbnews @tasanet @TexasTribune @dallasnews @USNewsEducation State funding my have slightly dropped as a % of overall pie based on #LBB estimate, but overall funding is up as is per student funding. See #LBB data.
@pennylowe @ShaneAlanHardin @KIM4erteach @teainfo @quorumreport @TPPF @tasbnews @tasanet @TexasTribune @dallasnews @USNewsEducation Again, please review LBB charts and tell me what is wrong with these statements: 1. pub ed $ up 2. per pupil $ up 3. Law requires look to local 1st. The #LBB argues adjustment?
@ShaneAlanHardin @KIM4erteach @teainfo @quorumreport @TPPF @tasbnews @tasanet @TexasTribune @dallasnews @USNewsEducation Obviously, TEA and LBB numbers differ, but still same facts! 1. Overall pub ed up 2. Per student up 3. State decline 8% since 2010 estimate. Look at LBB chart, what am I missing?  Only difference is CPI. #txlege #txed
@ShaneAlanHardin @KIM4erteach @teainfo @quorumreport @TPPF @tasbnews @tasanet @TexasTribune @dallasnews @USNewsEducation Yes! Look at LBB chart. As I have said, overall funding up, per student funding up, based on estimates “state” taxpayers paying 8% less as than 2019.  State should NOT ratchet up with local tax. #txlege #txed

@ShaneAlanHardin @KIM4erteach @teainfo @quorumreport You have made my argument. Sales tax should NOT go up when property taxes go up in a never ending tax ratchet scheme at state (sales) and local (property) tax level.

@ShaneAlanHardin @KIM4erteach @teainfo @quorumreport .@shanealenhardin #state funding is a larger % of overall #texas pub ed funding than in 2007 and has increased dramatically.

@ShaneAlanHardin @KIM4erteach @teainfo @quorumreport @TexasTribune In other words @shanalanhardin you were looking at the chart incorrectly. It is not per student, but total funding increase of $504M.
@KIM4erteach @ShaneAlanHardin @teainfo @quorumreport @KIMerteach school finance is funded with #state (sales) and #local (#property) funds.  #Tx don't want STATE #taxes to have to increase when #local taxes increase or it would require a massive STATE #tax increase and #tax ratchet scheme.

@ShaneAlanHardin @KIM4erteach @teainfo @quorumreport #Wrong. @teainfo says per student funding does keep up with inflation. Please see data that matches state books. To raise $12K more * 5.3M  = huge #tax increase. You want to #tax families? #Businesses #employees?

@KIM4erteach @ShaneAlanHardin @teainfo Yes, increase in student population WAS factored in!  Amounts are going up on a per student basis!

@ShaneAlanHardin @teainfo That is in #state funding only @ShaneAlanHardin. #taxpayers and #txlege need to see full pub ed funding picture, and not false information/ #fakenews that randomly leaves out more than half the #tax #funding picture, as you propose. Take note @tasbnews @tasanet
@ShaneAlanHardin @USNewsEducation #fakenews!! #taxpayers, #teachers, #educators deserve to know that #TX students are doing better than the East Coast with less $.

@TxlegeAdmirer @_erinmansfield @teainfo @quorumreport @DeLunaEva @TexasTribune @tasbnews @tasanet YOUR chart = #state funding for #public #education went down maybe 5% between 2010 and 2017. That is a SLIGHT decrease. Thus, it is misleading to say the state is not paying for pub. ed. These are charts from #LBB, your preferred source. Love it!. Plus, pub ed funding up. #txlege https://t.co/dmbz6kZJTj
@TxlegeAdmirer @_erinmansfield @teainfo @quorumreport @DeLunaEva @TexasTribune @tasbnews @tasanet That is not what #LBB or #TEA data says.

Comm. #Texas and #txlege deserve truth about how much #taxpayers are spending on #public #education and results. https://t.co/R5x04PEsns
@DeLunaEva @sgre144 @teainfo @quorumreport @TexasTribune @tasbnews @tasanet Actually, @teainfo past year spending data is reported to TEA directly by #Texas #public #school #districts and GAA (see below).

@TxlegeAdmirer @_erinmansfield @teainfo @quorumreport @DeLunaEva @TexasTribune @tasbnews @tasanet These LBB charts are dated.

@TxlegeAdmirer @_erinmansfield @teainfo @quorumreport @DeLunaEva @TexasTribune @tasbnews @tasanet This proves my point. If the decline is inf. adjust 6.6% than tagline should be: "Slight decline in state percentage of overall funding." That is very different than misleading indications that state funding is drying up. #txlege #txed https://t.co/BMQKzsLjTb
@DeLunaEva @sgre144 @teainfo @quorumreport @TexasTribune @tasbnews @tasanet Your best case is 6.6% decline in "state" spending, "infl. adjusted" over last 5 years.

@msunrullieone @pennylowe @ShaneAlanHardin Actually, TEA is now giving every child their Lexile score on the #STAAR report card and anyone can read the #STAAR passages - all recent #STAAR tests are online. If you have a concern about a passage, consider talking to TEA.
@hassettfive @ChandraKus @mishshel @TexasAFT @HFT2415 @TCCRI The recapture substitution % has stayed the same for nearly a decade. It is not supplanting any more or less than it always has. But my point is when local property taxes go up, state taxes should not also go up.
@msunrullieone @pennylowe @ShaneAlanHardin A lot of people are startled to learn that TX teachers approve every question and how involved TX teachers are in the creation of the #STAAR. But it is important bc TX teachers obviously know what TX kids she know and be able to do each year.
@msunrullieone @pennylowe @ShaneAlanHardin Thanks for your amazing service. My mom was a teacher!!  Please go look at TEA’s #STAAR video. All #STAAR questions are approved by TX teachers. In fact, just this summer, TEA held teacher institutes to develop questions. I can get you the link.

@ShaneAlanHardin I have high dreams for all children. My point is all children should be able to read at grade level, not approaching or below. #txlege #txed #knowthefacts.
@ShaneAlanHardin I deeply care about getting all kids to read at grade level, not just “approaching” grade level. Do you agree kids should be reading at grade level?
@edwonkkimmy @ShaneAlanHardin Do you agree that more than 60% read below grade level?  I am deeply committed to helping all kids read. It is the key to their future success. It’s starts with acknowledging that more than 50% read below grade level, which Shane is reluctant to do.
@ShaneAlanHardin @edwonkkimmy The #STAAR -standardized test - is developed and approved by TX teachers. Are you saying TX teachers don’t know what TX students should learn and know in each grade?
@ChandraKus @hassettfive @mishshel @TexasAFT @HFT2415 @TCCRI Thanks for validating my point. 😄
@ShaneAlanHardin That is not what I said or am saying. I do think it is important to understand that 58% of 3rd grade children read below grade level and we need all children reading. Please review TX promotion laws and US Dept of Ed comments.
@ShaneAlanHardin This is validate state data based on student #STAAR results.
@ShaneAlanHardin @msunrullieone Again, the STAAR test is developed and approved by TX teachers. Are you saying TX teachers are biased against minority children?
@ShaneAlanHardin @TexasAFT @teainfo Please research TX law and US Dept of Ed comments on TEA promotion policy.
@ShaneAlanHardin Please research TX law and TEA’s extensive data.
@ShaneAlanHardin Please research TX grade promotion laws and info at TEA.

@ShaneAlanHardin You circled all subjects, not reading. Please look at reading results. It says 54% are below grade level.
@ShaneAlanHardin @TexasAFT @teainfo I am referring to 3rd grade. There is no flaw.
@ShaneAlanHardin @TexasAFT @teainfo Approaching grade level is different than meeting grading level. Only 58% read at grade level. All my stats are correct. It is true that students can be promoted to the next grade level even if they are not prepared. #txed
@ShaneAlanHardin @teainfo @TeaIno I am not listed as the source of the TEA press release saying only 46% of 3rd graders read at grade level. It is on the TEA website and in official state docs. Go to the website or FOIA.
@ShaneAlanHardin Again stats from major press release of TEA follow the link or go look on their website.
@ShaneAlanHardin Please go to TEA’s press release on STAAR results. I sent you the link and took a snap shot. Again: #Knowthetruth
@ShaneAlanHardin @teainfo @TeaIno Also, this is not a blog it is very specific state records and data reported by TEA, the agency responsible for the data. I left before it was complied or released.
@ShaneAlanHardin @teainfo @TeaIno Don’t want you to struggle with hard concepts either. Recapture has not increased as a percent of state funding and is not supplanting. TEA data clearly shows this. #knowthefacts
@ChandraKus @hassettfive @mishshel @TexasAFT @HFT2415 @TCCRI Don’t want you to struggle with hard concepts either. Recapture has not increased as a percent of state funding and is not supplanting. TEA data clearly shows this. #knowthefacts
@ChandraKus @hassettfive @mishshel @TexasAFT @HFT2415 @TCCRI Hope you don’t struggle either. Recapture as a perfect of total state spending has not gone up over time. No supplanting. TEA has many charts to prove it. Hope that helps you.
@hassettfive @mishshel @TexasAFT @HFT2415 @TCCRI @ChandraKus Also, TEA has put out lots of data that says recapture has not really increased as a % of overall state spending. In other words, it is not supplanting state funds. #txlege
@hassettfive @mishshel @TexasAFT @HFT2415 @TCCRI @ChandraKus I am not sure what you mean. Taxpayers are paying all the money for pub ed, whether it is local (property) for the district, local (property) for recapture or state sales tax. When local property taxes go up, state taxes should not automatically go up as well. #txlege #txed
@ShaneAlanHardin Not sure what you are referring to. The audit has nothing to do with student #STAAR results.
