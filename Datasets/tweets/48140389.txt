I'm sure I've missed some and I bet there is more to come. Refugee resettlement has become more politicized than ever before but there still remains bipartisan support for robust refugee resettlement in 2019 and beyond.
And John Katko (R-NY) and David Young (R-IA) signed onto a letter from the bipartisan Refugee Caucus urging the president to show strong support for the refugee resettlement program. See the letter here: 	https://t.co/GOvvi6MR32

Senator James Lankford (R-OK) tweeted, "the US should be a nation that refugees can legally flee from religious or other persecution. America has a responsibility to promote compassion &amp; democracy around the world. We should continue to be that leader" via @SenatorLankford
Randy Hultgren (R-IL) and Jim McGovern (D-MA) together wrote, refugee resettlement has been and should continue to be a cornerstone of American foreign policy.  We should not be stepping back from our responsibility as a global leader" via https://t.co/6dSK5O2FTn
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) tweeted, "I'm appalled by Admin's decision to once again slash refugee caps. With crises in every region of the world, US should be doing more, not less, to be a global leader in refugee protection." via @RosLehtinen
Some Congressional Republicans have expressed concern over the 2019 refugee cap at a record low of 30,000 and the implications for both our national security and our humanitarian traditions: Here's a list:

Check out this thread for a little preview of the arguments and discussions found in our new refugee paper out today: https://t.co/MhWD0ngIhV https://t.co/PxCv04xtu2
New FY 2019 regional refugee ceilings:		Total: 30,000 (from 45,000)	Middle East: 9,000 (from 17,500)	Africa: 11,000 (from 19,000)	Latin America: 3,000 (from 1,500)	Europe: 3,000 (from 2,000) 		via @tedhesson https://t.co/8u7ojwcQK1
There's a ton more in our new paper that you can check out here: https://t.co/1UWOQkRyem
State continued, "in some locations in Africa, the prompt resettlement of politically sensitive cases helped diffuse regional tensions" &amp; "US resettlement efforts in the Middle East served to re-energize UNHCR‚Äôs &amp; other countries‚Äô efforts" to ensure protection to those in need.
In 2002, the U.S. State Dept wrote in their proposed refugee admissions report to Congress, "the foreign policy interests of the United States have been advanced by our willingness to share the burden with first asylum countries." https://t.co/2znKos9tHa
The U.S. resettlement system can simultaneously provide protection to vulnerable refugees and advance national security and foreign policy, as it did during the Cold War. https://t.co/c2wxdXBTYA
Having a robust refugee resettlement program gives the US leverage in influencing other countries to protect refugees and maintain regional stability. Check out this paragraph about refugees from Southeast Asia in 1979: https://t.co/dwZm2ZG2ej
As @IdeanSalehyan writes, "in 1953, the Refugee Relief Act provided for the admission of an additional 214,000 refugee, the bulk of whom fled communist-controlled nations in Eastern Europe. In signing the law, President Dwight D. Eisenhower said: https://t.co/qM07ovJYqV
Michael Chertoff, Michael Hayden, James Stavridis, Leon Panetta, Madeleine Albright, David Petraeus, Henry Kissinger, and many others have all signed onto letters endorsing refugee resettlement as a crucial strategic initiative: https://t.co/cKYDof9R3x
The U.S. refugee resettlement system helps the United States carry out foreign-policy objectives and serves the national interest, according to people who have held the highest-level intelligence and security positions within the government. See here: https://t.co/Wcp30Uhpiv
Refugee policy was always linked to foreign policy. Resettlement is not only an key humanitarian program, but one that promotes U.S. strategic interests as well. Advancing the national interest &amp; ensuring robust refugee protection are mutually reinforcing ‚Äî not exclusive ‚Äî goals.
Check out this chart showing refugee resettlement and foreign policy priorities from 1996-1999: just five percent of refugees were resettled from countries that were not former USSR, strategic rivals, or where US military engagements took place. https://t.co/6h5ZcmPuEa
As the paper explains, the U.S. utilized the unique advantages the resettlement system offered throughout the Cold War: embarrassing rival governments for their poor human rights records, draining them of human resources, and promoting the formation of opposition groups in exile.
Refugee resettlement and advancing national security and foreign policy interests have been intimately linked post-WW2. While humanitarianism "lies at the heart of resettlement", our own strategic concerns have always been hugely influential in decisions of who to resettle. https://t.co/ukf6HTfZba
@KoriSchake writes in the foreword that admitting refugees, "exercises our values as a safe harbor for people suffering danger and oppression and draws ideological contrast between the attractiveness of our way of life compared to that of our adversaries."
In the executive summary, author @IdeanSalehyan writes, "cuts to the resettlement program do little to enhance national security, and indeed, run counter to that end." Here's why: https://t.co/qT3puXT2Rf

Refugees are desperately fleeing Syria, Yemen, Venezuela, and many other places across the globe. This is a global challenge requiring a global response‚Äîone led by the United States. But instead of stepping up and showing diplomatic leadership we choose to close our doors.
Meager resettlement totals means the the victims of persecution and violence will continue to suffer without getting the second chance at life they deserve. We are substituting compassion and empathy for cruelty, and doing so at our own peril.
The new PD means more resettlement offices will close, more career personnel in the civil service and professional resettlement community will lose their jobs, and decades of expertise, knowledge, and understanding about resettlement practices will vanish.
The administration already sabotaged the domestic and international infrastructure to process refugees leading to the lowest resettlement totals in the modern conception of the program. But the damage doesn‚Äôt stop there and only worsens with this new refugee ceiling.

Here's the link to the post: https://t.co/FWNVtr3Efp
In conclusion, the US can enforce immigration laws and ensure immigrant self-sufficiency without cruelty. For the health of families, respect for the rule of law, and the good of the economy, the public charge rule should not be implemented.
Potentially most damaging are the public health risks associated with this rule as families forgo benefits and healthcare to preserve their immigration status. We saw something similar after 1996 welfare reform and there's reason to believe it could be worse in the Trump era. https://t.co/YMV4oRsyt8
They continue, "Our educational, nutrition, and healthcare programs are seen as serving the interests of the nation as a whole ‚Äî not leading the recipient to a state of primary dependence." Link: https://t.co/jGqzx5gLqF
As my Niskanen colleagues write "legal immigrants are prohibited from receiving public benefits for at least 5 years after their arrival. When noncitizens do become eligible for programs, they use them at substantially lower rates than their native-born counterparts."
DHS spokesman Tyler Houlton said any changes ‚Äúwould be in keeping with the letter and spirit of the law ‚Äî as well as the reasonable expectations of the American people for the government to be good stewards of taxpayer funds.‚Äù This is difficult to accept.
This rule will deter immigrants from accessing benefits programs. We see evidence of the chilling effects of this rule even before its been officially published: https://t.co/TJevtjuIuc
As @TheBushCenter's Laura Collins notes this proposal is ‚Äúparticularly stunning‚Äù for mixed-status families that could be punished for U.S. citizen children accessing benefits they are eligible for. https://t.co/MWGeB2fwlz
This rule is a massive break with precedent as the interpretation for public charge changes from primary dependence on public benefits to any receipt of public benefit.

Laura Collins at the George W. Bush Institute argued the rule change would, "make an already complicated immigration process more difficult for legal immigrants and temporary workers hurting the economy‚Äôs ability to grow." https://t.co/MWGeB1XVu1
Rep. Ros-Lehtinen continues: "Many immigrants work hard to make ends meet, and at times they are forced to depend on public benefits. But that should not disqualify those people from fulfilling their American Dream."
Retiring Rep. Ilena Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) said the policy, "would be a step in the wrong direction and send the message that the United States does not want new talents or workers.‚Äù She went on to call the policy "unjust, cruel, and discriminatory". 	https://t.co/SRr4BtEjU3

RT @JeremyLNeufeld: How Trump is changing the face of legal immigration https://t.co/3AeI60t3HD
For more background, I wrote this at the halfway mark of the FY on these trends: https://t.co/xLudqFX9ZV
This fiscal year the U.S. will fail to resettle half of its refugee ceiling. The only region that will reach their allotment is Europe, and it will blow it out of the water. East Asia will hopefully get to three-fourths its ceiling but will be a stretch.
But the lack of resettlement isn't balanced across regions. This chart shows the stark differences: Europe at 124 percent while Africa and Latin America will likely fail to break half of their allotments. https://t.co/l5QrHQ4bDm
It's likely resettlement numbers won't break half of the cap which was set at 45,000.
With three months left in the fiscal year‚Äîjust a quarter remaining‚Äîthe U.S. has resettled just 36 percent of its total refugee cap which was already the lowest since the program was created in 1980.
WaPo link here: https://t.co/WQFACACc24 and State Dept. data here: https://t.co/AO1kPoUQOh
Here's more context to the refugee #s in this great new WaPo piece from @ahauslohner‚Å©: the US has resettled just 36% of its overall FY 2018 refugee cap but the real story are the regional discrepancies. We've reached 124% of the European cap and just 19% of the South Asian cap. https://t.co/LS0TdBkIMw
Excellent new report from @ahauslohner‚Å© &amp; ‚Å¶@abtran‚Å© that explores the trends in legal immigration during the Trump administration and details what's occurring behind the scenes. Today's must-read piece of immigration commentary. https://t.co/begfsLAz8Y
They also note that the U.S. has only reached half of its refugee cap for this fiscal year with only three months left to go.
They continue: "The number of immigrant visas approved for Africans is on pace to fall 15 percent"
It doesn't stop there. WaPo finds, "the number of immigrant visas granted to people from Mexico, the Dominican Republic, the Philippines, China, India, Vietnam, Haiti, Bangladesh, Jamaica, Pakistan and Afghanistan has also declined"
Overall, legal immigration from all Muslim-majority countries is on track to fall by nearly a third.
The impact is felt most by the Muslim-majority countries on the travel ban list‚ÄîYemen, Syria, Iran, Libya and Somalia‚Äî where new arrivals are on pace for an 81 percent drop by the end of the fiscal year.
They find, "the number of people receiving visas to move permanently to the United States is on pace to drop 12 percent in President Trump‚Äôs first two years in office"

Here are the refugee ceilings and the admission numbers in the last 3 years (there are still 4 months left in FY 2018). https://t.co/JYRNGIZc3i
Last year the Trump administration set a record low refugee ceiling of 45,000. So far less than 15,000 refugees has been resettled. To put this all in context: it will be difficult for the US to resettle half of what is the lowest refugee ceiling since 1980.
That includes just 36 refugees from Honduras, 24 from Guatemala, and 386 from El Salvador. My colleague @kdpindc has more on this here: https://t.co/bGbbl8Xcp7
The FY 2018 regional allotment for Latin America/Carribean is set at 1,500 refugees. So far less than 500 refugees have been resettled from that region.
Here's the link to go through the State Department data: https://t.co/AO1kPoUQOh
So far in FY 2018, the U.S. has resettled just 46 Syrian refugees. https://t.co/qUp93rRIKj
At the same time, the US has resettled‚Äîwith four months left in the fiscal year‚Äîmore than 100 percent of its European cap. https://t.co/ZDUUlCfqBS

Refugees from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Somalia, and Sudan accounted for more than 40 percent (23,000) of total refugee admissions in FY 2017. This year, they are on pace to account for just 4 percent of admissions, or less than 900 in total. https://t.co/DX1SkU3SXY
The stark difference in regional resettlement percentages is not normal. The average resettlement totals at the halfway mark for the last five years were much more evenly distributed. For example, Africa has been cut in half yet Europe has almost doubled. https://t.co/SvBAm048L4
In the first six months of the fiscal year, the European ceiling is 87 percent filled while the Near East and South Asian ceiling is just 16 percent filled.
So far in 2018 the U.S. has resettled just 23 percent of its overall refugee ceiling, but the data reveals dramatic regional differences.

Republicans won't get anything on border security &amp; Dems won't get anything on Dreamers unless they both give a little. That's the takeaway.
Dream Act is stale &amp; has been tried already. A fresh approach is required = why Rep. Curbelo and House R's has been working on the RAC Act
So this all happens by pairing some border security/wall funding/etc w/ a conservative Dreamer bill ( RAC Act) and getting 60 in the Senate.
Huge support from Republicans on Dreamers. But details matter: age, criminal provisions, work requirements, length of process, etc.
The only way the White House and Republicans get anything on border security is if they negotiate with Dems on Dreamers.
White House and GOP leadership want to/need to get something on border security accomplished. Votes in the House are there. Not in Senate.

We've been debating Dreamers since 2001. It's time to finally Recognize America's Children. Let's pass the RAC Act in 2017. [Conclusion]
Something that more folks need to recognize: only a GOP-led solution would come up for a vote &amp; pass. It's time to focus on RAC.
My colleague @JeremyLNeufeld argues in favor of RAC forcefully here: https://t.co/TLzjpELGOt
We applaud @SenThomTillis and @RepCurbelo for their dedication to finding pragmatic solutions to pressing national problems.
Senator Tillis and his colleagues have a unique opportunity to pass meaningful immigration reform that protects Dreamers &amp; helps our economy
Two‚Äîthe "Dream Act" failed before &amp; is stale. It's time for a new Dreamer solution: a permanent, conservative initiative that could pass.
First, there is widespread agreement that Dreamers should not be deported and some path to status is needed.
Me and my colleagues at @NiskanenCenter have taken a substantial number of meetings on Capitol Hill about Dreamers. Two things are clear:
Sen. Tillis introducing RAC in the Senate is huge. Only Congress can provide permanent protections for Dreamers. That should be the focus.
For a list of quotes from Republicans on Dreamers click here: https://t.co/NJJz36zxsK
In the Senate, there is wide agreement amongst Republicans that Dreamers deserve protection and only Congress can make it happen.
In the House, there are 18 Republican co-sponsors of the RAC Act from 12 states. With the DACA rollback, that number will increase in Sept.
The Curbelo/Tillis plan would, over a decade, generate 115,000 new jobs, increase‚Äã ‚ÄãGDP‚Äã ‚Äãby‚Äã ‚Äã$79‚Äã B, &amp; boost net fed gov revenue $21 B.
The economic impact of Dreamers is massive. @karlbykarlsmith and @JeremyLNeufeld break down the numbers: https://t.co/F7E16sV2lL
75% of Trump voters support legal status over deportation. Support from conservatives, tea-partiers, &amp; Romney voters all above 70 percent.
Eight-in-ten voters agree legal status is preferred for Dreamers over deportation. https://t.co/AQcOqRwYsS
RAC Act is the conservative solution for Dreamers. It offers young immigrants the opportunity to earn conditional status through 3 pathways.
Reporting out today indicates Senator Tillis (R-NC) will introduce a Senate companion of the legislation in Sept. https://t.co/ML34Kn653e
The bill offers status to Dreamers who work, study, or serve in the military while meeting certain requirements. It's rigorous but fair.
It's called the Recognizing America's Children (RAC) Act. Rep. Curbelo (R-FL) introduced it first in the House earlier this year.

RT @LilySAxelrod: Helpful thread re: a Republican bill that could help some Dreamers. #SaveDACA https://t.co/XHO3j2nXeQ
If DACA stays under threat, Republicans must step up to protect Dreamers &amp; Democrats must meet them at the table. Let's pass the RAC Act.
There is wide support amongst Republican lawmakers to provide some form of earned legal status for Dreamers.
As the pressure on Congress increases to find a permanent solution for Dreamers, the RAC Act should be front and center in the conversation.
The RAC Act is latest attempt at Dreamer legislation. With a GOP House, Senate, &amp; WH, the new Dream Act has to be viable to Republicans.
The first Dream Act was introduced way back in 2001, and many have been introduced since then. It failed in 2010.
The supportive trend continues:		Conservatives: 74% support legal status	Tea Partiers: 75% 	Romney voters: 73%
In fact, 75 percent of Trump voters back legal status instead of deportation. https://t.co/VQxJUKnvwM
The polling on Dreamers is incredibly encouraging. In total, voters support offering Dreamers legal status 78-14.

and Donovan (NY), Faso (NY), McSally (AZ), and Newhouse (WA), Fitzpatrick (PA), and Bacon (NE), and Diaz-Balert (FL).
The bill has the support of 17 other House R's: Coffman (CO), Denham (CA), Amodei (NV), Upton (MI), Reichart (WA), Kinzinger (IL)...
@RepCurbelo ‚Äî "These are America‚Äôs children and it‚Äôs about time that we accept them and give them that path to full American citizenship".
If these Dreamers meet certain requirements, they can adjust to permanent status in 5 years &amp; citizenship after 10. It's rigorous but fair.
The bill provides a permanent solution for undocumented children &amp; young adults if they 1) work 2) study or 3) serve https://t.co/lXDoKURjcC
It's called the Recognizing America's Children (RAC) Act, introduced by @RepCurbelo, co-sponsored by 17 other House Republicans.

Nations globally = liberalizing migration policies to attract investors, entrepreneurs, students, &amp; skilled workers -- US the exact opposite
Also should be noted H-1B is not just for techies in SF. Companies around the country of all sizes rely on program to grow their firms.
Foreign students subsidize the cost of college for American students. A drop in international enrollment means schools charge more
If you're skilled and outside the US, the case for working in Toronto, Berlin, Seoul, or London seems more attractive everyday than the US
WH "America First" visa policy makes it harder for top global talent to work in US. Hurts individual companies and overall US productivity
Reducing the duration of the visa, increasing the regs, and making the lottery harder to win will push some companies to give up on program
Consensus is that 85,000 annual H-1Bs for the US in global economy is remarkably low (demand is 3x that), &amp;WH wants to cut to less than 85k
Massive implications from the WH desired visa reforms: big drop in intl student enrollment, top talent will choose friendly countries...
