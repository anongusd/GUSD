Q: "Does the green new deal go too far?"	Bernie Sanders: "No. You cannot go too far on the issue of climate change. The future of the planet is at stake, ok? ... According to the best scientists in the world, we have 12 years to begin substantially cutting carbon emissions."
Q: "But you're not interested in any advice from her?"	Sanders: "I think not."
Sanders asked if he'll have meeting w/ Hillary Clinton, like other 2020 candidates: "I suspect not. Hillary has not called me. Look, we have differences. She -- Hillary has played a very important role in American politics."

RT @mviser: "WE HAVE GOT TO GET BACK TO NORMAL!" Rep. Elijah Cummings says, concluding a very abnormal congressional hearing.
Cohen said this led him to "presume that [Trump] is not under audit.‚Äù He also said that he had ‚Äúasked for a copy of the audit so that I could use it in terms of my statements to the press and I was never able to obtain one."
Cohen: "He had said to me is that what he didn‚Äôt want was to have an entire group of think tanks that are tax experts run through his tax return and start ripping it to pieces and then he‚Äôll end up in an audit and he‚Äôll ultimately have taxable consequences, penalties and so on."
Also noteworthy: Earlier in hearing, Rep. Jimmy Gomez asked Cohen about Trump tax returns, and Cohen said he believes Trump is *not* under audit (Trump's oft-repeated reason for not releasing returns)
Rep. Ro Khanna questioning Cohen: "Are you telling us, Mr. Cohen, that the president directed transactions in conspiracy with Allen Weisselberg and his son, Donald Trump Jr., as part of a... criminal conspiracy of financial fraud. Is that your testimony today?"	Cohen: "Yes." https://t.co/q6FMGdKmWw

AOC: "And where would the committee find more information on this? Do you think we need to review his financial statements and tax returns in order to compare them?"	Cohen: "Yes and you‚Äôd find it at the Trump Org."

Cohen: "[Trump] was supposed to pay, he was supposed to pay $125,000 for the life story of Karen McDougal. For whatever the reason may be, he elected not to pay it, David Pecker was very angry because there was also other monies [he] had expended on his behalf."

Q: "Is there any other wrongdoing or illegal act that you are aware of regarding Donald Trump that we haven‚Äôt yet discussed today?"	Cohen: "Yes and again those are part of the investigation that‚Äôs currently being looked at by the Southern District of New York."
Cohen: "Yes I made my mistakes, I‚Äôll say it now &amp; again. And I‚Äôm going to pay the ultimate price. But I‚Äôm not here today &amp; the American people don't care about my taxes. They want to know what it is I know about Mr. Trump. And not one question so far has been asked about [Trump]"
Cohen to Rep. Jordan: "I just find it interesting, sir, that between yourself and your colleagues, that not one question so far, since I‚Äôm here, has been asked about President Trump. That‚Äôs actually why I thought I was coming today. Not to confess the mistakes that I‚Äôve made."

Cohen: "Every day, most of us knew we were coming in and we were going to lie for him on something. And that became the norm. And that‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs happening right now in this country and it‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs happening here in government, sir."
Cohen: "Everybody‚Äôs job at the Trump organization is to protect Mr. Trump."
Rep. Cooper: "Have you ever seen Mr. Trump personally threaten someone with physical harm?"	Cohen: "No. He would use others."	Cooper: "He would hire other people to do that?"	Cohen: "I‚Äôm not so sure he had to hire them -- they were already working there."
Cohen: "When Mr. Trump turned around early in the campaign and said, I could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and get away with it -- I want to be very clear. He‚Äôs not joking. He‚Äôs telling you the truth. You see, you don‚Äôt know him. I do." https://t.co/7W2YfisLbN
Fireworks between Cohen/Rep. Gosar:	Gosar: "You‚Äôre a pathological liar. You don‚Äôt know truth from falsehood. So again-"	Cohen: "Sorry, are you referring to me or the president?"

Clay: "To your knowledge did the president every provide inflated assets to a bank [to] help him obtain a loan?"	...	Cohen: "These documents &amp; others were provided to Deutsche Bank in one occasion... to obtain money so that we could put a bid in on the Buffalo Bills"
Rep. Clay: "Did the president or his company ever inflate assets or revenue?"	Cohen: "Yes."	Clay: "And was that done with the president‚Äôs knowledge or direction?"	Cohen: "Everything was done with the knowledge and at the direction of Mr. Trump."
Rep. Mark Meadows: "I guess what I am saying is, I‚Äôve talked to the president over 300 times, I‚Äôve not heard one time a racist comment out of his mouth in private."
Cohen: "I have taped individuals... Maybe 100 times over ten years?"
Charged exchange w/ Cohen &amp; Rep. Jim Jordan --	Jordan: "His remorse is nonexistent! He just debated a member of Congress..."	Cohen: "Shame on you, Mr. Jordan. That‚Äôs not what I said.

We've now entered the "Women for Cohen" portion of the hearing
Cummings: "Donald Trump wrote you a check out of his personal account while he was serving as President of the United States of America, to reimburse you for hush money payments to Ms. Clifford -- is that what you are telling the American people today?"	Cohen: "Yes Mr. Chairman."
Cohen: "He acknowledged to Allen that he was going to pay the $130,000 and that Allen and I should go back to his office and figure out how to do it. So yes sir I stand by the statement that i gave that there was a history to it."
Cohen: "When it was ultimately determined, and this was days before the election, that Mr. Trump was going to pay the $130,000, in the office with me was Allen Weisselberg, Chief Financial Officer of the Trump Organization."
Cohen: "And after several rounds of conversations with him about purchasing her life rights for $130,000, what I did each and every time is go straight into Mr. Trump‚Äôs office and discuss the issue with him."
Cohen to Cummings: "Back in 2017, when I -- actually I apologize, 2016, prior to the election, I was contacted by Keith Davidson, who is the attorney, or was the attorney, for Ms. Clifford, for Stormy Daniels."
RT @jeffzeleny: ‚ÄúAs of yesterday, I am no longer a lawyer. I lost my law license,‚Äù @MichaelCohen212 tells @RepCummings at the opening of qu‚Ä¶
Cohen: "For those who question my motives for being here today, I understand. I have lied, but I am not a liar. I have done bad things, but I am not a bad man. I have fixed things, but I am no longer your 'fixer,' Mr. Trump."
Cohen on June 2016 Trump Tower meeting: "[Trump] had frequently told me and others that his son Don Jr. had the worst judgment of anyone in the world. And that Don Jr. would never set up any meeting of any significance alone, and certainly not w/out checking with his father."
Cohen: "Questions have been raised about whether I know of direct evidence that Mr. Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia. I do not. I want to be clear. But, I have my suspicions."
Cohen: "I find it ironic, President Trump, that you are in Vietnam right now."
Cohen: "He finished the conversation with the following comment. 'You think I‚Äôm	stupid, I wasn‚Äôt going to Vietnam.'"
Cohen: "Mr. Trump claimed it was because of a bone spur, but when I asked for	medical records, he gave me none and said there was no surgery. He told	me not to answer the specific questions by reporters but rather offer simply	the fact that he received a medical deferment."
Cohen: "Mr. Trump said he did not consider Vietnam Veteran, and Prisoner of War, [John McCain] to be 'a hero' because he likes people who weren‚Äôt captured. At the same time, Mr. Trump tasked me to handle the negative press surrounding his medical deferment from the Vietnam draft"
Cohen: "When I say conman, I‚Äôm talking about a man who declares himself brilliant but directed me to threaten his high school, his colleges, and the College Board to never release his grades or SAT scores."
Cohen: "The President of the United States thus wrote a personal check for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws."
Cohen: "I am providing a copy of a $35,000 check that President Trump personally signed from his personal bank 14 account on August 1, 2017 ... pursuant to the cover-up, which was the basis of my guilty plea, to reimburse me ... for the illegal hush money I paid on his behalf."
Cohen: "I am going to jail in part because of my decision to help Mr. Trump hide that payment from the American people before they voted a few days later."
Cohen: "[Trump] asked me to pay off an adult film star with whom he had an affair, and to lie about it to his wife, which I did. And lying to the First Lady is one of my biggest regrets. Because she is a kind, good person. I respect her greatly ‚Äì and she did not deserve that."
Cohen: "While we were once driving through a struggling neighborhood in Chicago, he commented that only black people could live that way. And, he told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid. And yet I continued to work for him."
Cohen: "Mr. Trump responded by stating to the effect of 'wouldn‚Äôt that be great.'"
Cohen: "Mr. Stone told Mr. Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign."
Cohen: "In July 2016, days before the Democratic convention, I was in Mr. Trump‚Äôs office when his secretary announced that Roger Stone was on the phone. Mr. Trump put Mr. Stone on the speakerphone."
Cohen: "A lot of people have asked me about whether Mr. Trump knew about the release of the hacked Democratic National Committee emails ahead of time. The answer is yes."
Cohen: "He never expected to win the primary. He never expected to win the general election. The campaign ‚Äì for him ‚Äì was always a marketing opportunity."
Cohen: "Mr. Trump is an enigma. He is complicated, as am I. He has both good and bad, as do we all. But the bad far outweighs the good, and since taking office, he has become the worst version of himself."
Michael Cohen: "And for the record, Individual-1 is President Donald J. Trump."
Cohen: "And he made it clear to me because his personal attorneys reviewed my statement before I gave it to Congress."
Cohen: "And so I lied about it, too ‚Äì because Mr. Trump had made clear to me, through his personal statements to me that we both knew were false and through his lies to the country, that he wanted me to lie."
Cohen: "He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project."
Cohen: "To be clear: Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it. He lied about it because he never expected to win the election."
Cohen: "You need to know that Mr. Trump‚Äôs personal lawyers reviewed and edited	my statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow Tower negotiations before I gave it."
Cohen: "In his way, he was telling me to lie."
Cohen: "In conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell 5 me there‚Äôs no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing."
Cohen: "Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That‚Äôs not how he operates."
Cohen: "I lied to Congress about when Mr. Trump stopped negotiating the Moscow Tower project in Russia. I stated that we stopped negotiating in January 2016. That was false ‚Äì our negotiations continued for months later during the campaign."
Cohen: "I want to apologize to each of you and to Congress as a whole. The last time I appeared before Congress, I came to protect Mr. Trump. Today, I‚Äôm here to tell the truth about Mr. Trump."
Cohen: "I hope my appearance here today, my guilty plea, and my work with law enforcement agencies are steps along a path of redemption that will restore faith in me and help this country understand our president better."
Cohen: "[Trump] was a presidential candidate who knew that Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about a WikiLeaks drop of Democratic National Committee emails. I will explain each in a few moments."
Cohen: "I am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr. Trump‚Äôs illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience. I am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is. He is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat."
Michael Cohen: "Never in a million years did I imagine, when I accepted a job in 2007 to work for Donald Trump, that he would one day run for President, launch a 2 campaign on a platform of hate and intolerance, and actually win. I regret the day I said ‚Äúyes‚Äù to Mr. Trump."
And we're off: https://t.co/wnSESBGIFe
Rep. Jordan: "Here we go ‚Äì here we go, your first big hearing, your first announced witness ‚Äì Michael Cohen. I want everyone in this room to think about this. The first announced witness for the 116th Congress is a guy who is going to prison in two months for ‚Äì lying to Congress"
Rep. Elijah Cummings: "The testimony that Michael Cohen will provide today, ladies and gentlemen, is deeply disturbing. And it should be troubling to all Americans. We will all have to make our own evaluation of the evidence and Mr. Cohen‚Äôs credibility... But we must weigh it."

Buttigieg on VP Pence: "He‚Äôs written that he thinks cigarettes don‚Äôt kill. He seems to believe people like me just get up &amp; decide to be gay. His world view is one that is way out of step with the American mainstream. And we saw it in Indiana when he really embarrassed our state" https://t.co/5k0PaxsiMB
Buttigieg: "We need to make sure whether an idea is labeled as right, left, capitalist, socialist or otherwise, that we just evaluate whether the idea makes sense, whether it is good and whether there is evidence that it will work."
Buttigieg: "This is a word that seems more a piece of political rhetoric than a rigorous explanation... of a set of ideas. When we are talking about socialism are we talking about Venezuela, that nobody wants? Or are we talking about a situation, like what there is in Denmark?"
Pete Buttigieg: "I think the word socialism has begun to lose its meaning. I think that‚Äôs a process that started when the right referred to the Affordable Care Act as socialism, even though it was a market-based policy that was invented at the conservative Heritage Foundation."
Pete Buttigieg on Afghanistan: "I‚Äôm very concerned that what you have right now is a process of engaging the Taliban in peace talks that seems to be leaving the Afghan government ... that we helped create the conditions for it to arise, it is leaving them off to the side."
Buttigieg on green new deal: "I don‚Äôt think that elected officials will be devising all the technical measures to get there any more than President Kennedy was calculating rocket trajectories when he said that this country should go to the moon ... But we need to set the goals."
Buttigieg: "We need to treat [climate change] as a national emergency that has the same destructive power as something like the Great Depression or a world war."
Buttigieg: "As a mayor, I have [had] to activate an emergency operations center in South Bend for what should be a historic level of flooding. One was 500-year and one was 1,000-year. And they happened 18 months apart. That means that climate really is an emergency."
Pete Buttigieg on green new deal: "I don‚Äôt think a goal should alienate people. And lets be honest, the green new is in its current form more a set of goals than a fully articulated set of policies or a road map. But I think our goals need to be more, not less ambitious."
Buttigieg on South Bend: "I think we are living proof that the formula for reaching the hearts of the industrial midwest doesn‚Äôt have to be nostalgia, or resentment, or promises that can‚Äôt be kept to find greatness in some impossible -- again, by turning back the clock."
Pete Buttigieg on @NewDay: "Coming from a party that ...my party, the Democratic party -- seemed to have lost touch in the last election with the middle of the country, maybe it makes sense to have more voices from the industrial Midwest"

Amy Klobuchar announces raising over $1 million w/ contributions from all 50 states in 48 hours following presidential campaign announcement
Klobuchar: "But that is because I have high expectations of myself. I have high expectations of those that work with me, and i have high expectations for our country."
Klobuchar: "I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs all anonymous. But I will say that i am proud of our staff, and yes I can be a tough boss, and push people. That‚Äôs obvious."
Klobuchar on BuzzFeed report that staffer was hit by binder: "If you look at that story, I think you‚Äôll see, it said something about me throwing a binder down, not at someone." (Story: https://t.co/6JKjrdVl76) https://t.co/t9lFnMcdSj
Klobuchar on HuffPost report that Harry Reid "rebuked" her over staff treatment: "I called Senator Reid when I heard this, and he doesn‚Äôt remember that, and I don‚Äôt remember that either." (Story: https://t.co/otErRblCsR)
Klobuchar: "The answer is, how do you pick the ones that get deported? I would say look at people that have committed crimes, that have committed crimes no matter where they‚Äôve lived. And serious crimes."
Klobuchar: "I would like to see comprehensive immigration reform... we don‚Äôt want to deport 12 million people."
Klobuchar: "I have not looked at this [spending] agreement yet. Of course it was just reached. But I know that that was a major focus of some of the negotiations, to up the work being done at the ports of entry."
Klobuchar: "I believe that you can have border security and do it in a smart way. I don‚Äôt think that is running a wall across the whole border."
More from Amy Klobuchar on Fox: "I‚Äôm a Democrat and not a socialist... I believe in capitalism. I just believe that you also need a strong government that looks at things like, well, if you have all monopolies and you‚Äôve got no competition, you‚Äôve got to have antitrust laws."
Klobuchar: "I view it as a framework for discussion, but nothing that we are not going to reduce air travel right now. We are not going to get rid of all of these industries right now. We just need to start as a country seeing it as an aspiration to do better than we are doing." https://t.co/7CihPUhBbg
Q: "Economic security for all who are unable or unwilling to work?"	Klobuchar: "I don‚Äôt agree with 'unwilling to work.'"
Klobuchar on Green New Deal: "I am for a jump-start of the discussion and a framework, as Senator Markey has described. I‚Äôm not for reducing air travel."
Amy Klobuchar on Fox: "The green new deal? I see it as ‚Äì by the way, I see it as aspirational. I see it as a jump start. So, I would vote yes, but I would also, if it got down to the nitty-gritty of an actual legislation... that would be different for me."

Sanders: "[Dr. King] was a man of unbelievable courage, who understood not only that we have got to end racism, but that we need economic justice."
Bernie Sanders: "Back in 1963, Dr. King demanded that workers be paid a living wage. Today, we have got to fulfill that demand and raise that minimum wage to $15 an hour."
Bernie Sanders: "And I find it remarkable that 56 years after that march, many of the demands that Dr. King and others made are still demands that we have got to fight for today."
Bernie Sanders: "We were there to demand an end to racism and to support Dr. King‚Äôs call for economic justice. Because let us never forget that the title of that march was 'jobs and freedom.' Jobs and freedom."
Bernie Sanders: "Racial equality must be central to combating economic inequality, if we are going to create a government that works for all of us, and not just the 1%."
Bernie Sanders: "Racism ... exists in this country today, and it exists when the median white family owns ten times more wealth than the median African American family."
Bernie Sanders: ‚ÄúWe say to President Trump today: This country has suffered too long from discrimination. We are not going backwards. We are going forwards to a non-discriminatory society.‚Äù

Barr: "I‚Äôd like to make a point about the ‚Äòwitch hunt,‚Äô which is, we have to remember that the president is the one that, you know, has denied that there was any collusion, and has been steadfast in that. So, presumably he knows facts."

Barr: "I‚Äôm not going to go after companies that have relied on the Cole memorandum. However, we either should have a federal law that prohibits marijuana everywhere -- which I would support, myself, because I think it‚Äôs a mistake to back off on marijuana."

2020 watch: Cory Booker's turn to question Barr. Opens w/ question about marijuana legalization &amp; the Cole memorandum.
Barr: "People should be aware that the rules I think say that the special counsel will prepare a summary report on any prosecutive or declination decisions, &amp; that that shall be confidential &amp; shall be treated as any other declination or prosecutive material w/in the department"

me in 2009 vs me in 2019, but it's me at the start of the attorney general confirmation hearing vs me whenever it finishes
Barr: "I am not going to surrender the responsibilities of the attorney general to get the title. I don‚Äôt need the title." https://t.co/dXCA2qGLWo
Hawley: What if tech companies "manipulate their algorithms to significantly swing voter turnout to favor a candidate of their choice?"	Barr: "I‚Äôd have to think about that. I‚Äôm not sure - you know, I‚Äôd like to know more about the phenomena and what laws could be implicated by it"
Hawley: "Do you think the DOJ has authority ... to address bias by dominant online platforms?"	Barr: "I would just say generally, I wouldn't think it would -- I would have to think long and hard before I said that it was really the stuff of an antitrust matter."
Barr on Roe v Wade: "It‚Äôs been 46 years and the department has stopped -- under Republican administrations, stopped as a routine matter asking that it be overruled, and I don‚Äôt see that being resumed."
Coons and Barr go back and forth on possibility of subpoena for Trump testimony: "If there was a factual basis for doing it, and I couldn‚Äôt say that it violated established policies, then I wouldn‚Äôt interfere. But I don‚Äôt know what the facts are." https://t.co/qJ55NZIaG6
Coons: "If the president directed you to change those regulations and fire Mueller, or simply directly fired Mueller, would you ... resign instead?"	Barr: "Assuming there was no good cause?"	Coons: "Assuming no good cause."	Barr: "I would not carry out that instruction."
Some hedging on this from Barr later in the hearing: "[Sessions is] the one responsible for making the recusal decision. I don‚Äôt know why he locked himself into following the advice. That‚Äôs an abdication of his own responsibility." https://t.co/YzeaonB9kt
Barr on religious liberty: "I believe in the separation of church and state, but I am sometimes concerned that we not use governmental power to suppress the freedoms of traditional religious communities in our country."
Amy Klobuchar: "If you‚Äôre confirmed, will the Justice Department jail reporters for doing their jobs?"	Barr: "I can conceive of situations where, you know, as a last resort ... there could be a situation where someone would be held in contempt" https://t.co/EjIOSjGNZc
Barr: "... I would like to see a deal reached where by Congress recognizes that it‚Äôs imperative to have border security, and that part of that border security as a common sense matter needs barriers.‚Äù
Barr on border wall: ‚ÄúWe need money right now for border security, including barriers and walls and slats and other things, anything that makes sense in different areas of the border... "

Barr's full answer on tech company antitrust concerns: https://t.co/Ehn4F34Uen
Barr: "And you know, you can win that place in the marketplace without violating the antitrust laws, but I want to find out more about that dynamic."
Barr: "I don‚Äôt think big is necessarily bad, but I think a lot of people wonder how such huge behemoths that now exist in Silicon Valley have taken shape under the nose of the antitrust enforcers."
Barr on tech companies/antitrust concerns: "The purpose of the antitrust laws obviously is to protect competition...At the same time, I‚Äôm sort of interested in stepping back &amp; reassessing or learning more about how the antitrust division has been functioning &amp; [their priorities]"

Barr on Comey's first Clinton announcement: "I thought that to the extent that he actually announced a decision, was wrong, and the other thing is, if you‚Äôre not going to indict someone, then you don‚Äôt stand up there and unload negative information about the person."
Barr: "In June of 2017, middle of June, Ambassador David Friedman, who is the US Ambassador to Israel ... he reached out to me and we talked one evening, and he said that he -- well, my understanding was, he was interested in finding lawyers that could augment the defense team."

Feinstein: "Have you discussed the Mueller investigation with the president or anyone else in the White House?"	Barr: "Um, I discussed the Mueller investigation, but not in any particular substance."
On Barr's 19 page memo:	Graham: "Don‚Äôt you think President Trump is a one-pager kind of guy?"	Barr: "Excuse me?"	Graham: "President Trump is a one-pager kind of guy?"	Barr: "I suspect he is."
Graham: "Do you believe that AG Sessions had a conflict because he worked on the Trump campaign?"	Barr: "Uh‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure of all the facts but I think he probably did the right thing recusing himself."	Graham: "I agree. I think he did the right thing to recuse himself."
Barr: "I don‚Äôt believe Mr. Mueller would be involved in a witch hunt."
Graham opens up by going through the points of the Page, Strzok, Ohr cases -- "we need to look at," "get to the bottom"

Barr: "If confirmed, I will not permit partisan politics, personal interest or any other improper considerations to interfere with this [investigation], I will follow the special counsel regulations scrupulously... &amp; on my watch, Bob [Mueller] will be allowed to finish his work."
Barr: "President Trump has sought no assurances, promises, or commitments from me of any kind, either express or implied, and I have not given him any, other than that I would run the department with professionalism and integrity."
here we go: https://t.co/RJKkDKMY6J
Feinstein: "So it does raise questions about your willingness to reach conclusions before knowing the facts, and whether you prejudge the Mueller investigation. And I hope you‚Äôll make that clear today."
Feinstein: "Your memo also shows a large sweeping view of presidential authority and a determined effort, I thought, to undermine Bob Mueller, even though you state you have been friends and are in the dark about many of the facts about the investigation."
Feinstein: "In [your] memo, you conclude, I think, that special counsel Mueller is ‚Äògrossly irresponsible for pursuing an obstruction case against the president, and pursuing the obstruction inquiry is fatally misconceived.‚Äô So I hope we can straighten that out in this hearing."
Graham: "But I just want to let you know Mr. Barr that we appreciate you stepping up at a time when the country needs somebody of your background and your temperament to be in charge of the rule of the law."
Graham: "You will be challenged, you should be challenged. The memo, there will be a lot of talk about it. As there should be."
Lindsey Graham, in opening remarks at Barr hearing: "So about me. I want us to do better. And I'll be as measured as possible. The immigration Lindsey will show up. But the other guy's there too, and I don't like him any more than you do."

O'Rourke: "So, I would be very disappointed, for any member of Congress of either party, to spend $5 billion to build more suffering, and do it to purchase some short term political comfort."
O'Rourke: "It would cause enormous suffering, pain and death for people who are fleeing enormous suffering, pain and death in the deadliest countries in this hemisphere right now. In some cases, the deadliest countries in the world. And that cannot be who we are as a country."
O'Rourke: "It would destroy people‚Äôs farms and ranches and homesteads, their private property, it would be taken from them to build a wall. It would cost us, if we built the entirety of the wall, $25 to $30 billion, many billions more to maintain it. And it would kill people."
O'Rourke: "I would be disappointed [if the Democrats capitulated on the wall] ... Because it would destroy so many communities along the border, it would destroy habitats for wildlife."
O'Rourke: "If more walls are built -- the walls we have right now are causing those deaths; more walls will cause more deaths, more suffering, more misery, and your conscience will judge you. Your kids will. I guarantee you. And it‚Äôs on us to get it right."
O'Rourke: "We just saw two tragic deaths of children 7 years old, 8 years old, in the last month here in the El Paso region ... They just survived one of the most treacherous journeys, made even harder by the walls and physical barriers that push them to these remote corners."
O'Rourke: "Not only do we not need a wall, by any measure, but that wall is bound to cause death and suffering and misery ... We‚Äôre at the lowest [border apprehension] levels of our lifetime. And those who are coming are asylum seekers."
More from O'Rourke: "What I think the president is so effective at doing is he, through his speech, recounted some really horrific murders ... It is, on the one hand, masterful in its ability to directly connect with fear and stoke anxiety and even panic." https://t.co/LMCrzvVyoN
O'Rourke: "And, shit, the President of the United States just said that there are rapists and criminals and murderers who will chop your head off coming to get us. ‚ÄòFuck yeah, build a wall.‚Äô And so, I can you know, I can see responding that	 way."
Beto O'Rourke responding to Trump on FB live, last night: "I think [Trump] has seized this emotional language very effectively, completely irresponsibly ... But if I don‚Äôt live in El Paso, if I haven‚Äôt had the experience that we‚Äôve had ... I may not know any better." https://t.co/ML4eDTlugT

Warren: "I believe in us. I believe in what we can do. I believe in democracy and I believe in what we must do to save it."
Warren: "The challenge we face may be our most profound since the end of WWII. Here's the truth: In our time together this afternoon, we have only scratched the surface of the problems that we face. None of this will be easy. But we will persist."
Warren: "We are not sliding toward autocracy -- not without a fight."
Warren: "I can't leave here today without addressing the elephant in the room: President Trump and his political allies in Congress" -- "Trump's actions and instincts align" with "authoritarians around the globe."
Warren hammering "authoritarian" governments in China, Russia -- "The combination of authoritarianism and corrupt capitalism is a fundamental threat to democracy both here in the United States and around the world."
Warren: "Just like the hateful terrorism of Al Qaeda and ISIS, domestic right-wing terrorism is completely incompatible with American values. It is a threat to the safety and security of the United States. We must not tolerate it in the United States of America."
Warren: "Our needs at home are many ... a government that is not for sale to the highest bidder."
Warren: "A foreign policy that works for all Americans must recognize that America can project power abroad only if we are strong and secure at home." Slams GOP tax cuts.
Warren's three principles: 	1. No new nuclear weapons	2. More international arms control, not less -- extend new START through 2026	3. No first use	"Deterrence is the sole purpose of our arsenal."
Warren: "Trump's nuclear arms race does not make us, or the world, any safer."
Warren: "We should also look at where our defense spending is actually counterproductive ... The president has threatened Russia with a nuclear arms race, saying we will simply outspend our rivals. Boy is that wrong."
Warren: "America should also be reinvesting in diplomacy. Foreign policy should not be run exclusively by the Pentagon."
Warren: "The defense industry will inevitably have a seat at the table -- but they shouldn't get to own the table."
Warren: Start by "ending the stranglehold of defense contractors on our military policy."
Warren on military spending: "This is unsustainable. If more money for the Pentagon could solve our security challengers, we would have solved them by now."
Warren: "It is time to bring our troops home from Afghanistan, starting right now."
Warren: "We have 'turned the corner' in Afghanistan so many times that we are now going in a circle."
Warren: "While our leaders were focused on wars in different lands, the world changed under our feet. Would-be rivals like China and Russia watched and learned, and they are hard at work developing technologies and tactics ... to leapfrog the United States."
Warren: "Congress has shirked its responsibility to oversee these expanding conflicts. Despite America's huge investment, these wars have not succeeded even on their own terms. 17 years later, the Middle East remains in shambles."
Warren: "A foreign policy that lifts the fortunes of all Americans must also take an honest look at the full costs and risks of our military actions."
Warren: "To make progress on climate change, and protect our higher standards here in the U.S., we should leverage foreign countries' desire to access U.S. markets as an opportunity to insist on meaningful environmental protections."
Warren: "To address corruption, we need transparency about the movement of assets across borders. To get serious about privacy, we need to actually protect data rights."
Warren: "I oppose NAFTA 2.0, and I will vote against it in the Senate unless President Trump reopens the agreement and produces a better deal for America's working families."
Warren: "There's no question we need to renegotiate NAFTA ... but as it's currently written, Trump's deal won't stop the serious and ongoing harm NAFTA causes American workers ... It's NAFTA 2.0."
Warren: "I believe capitalism has the capacity to deliver extraordinary benefits ... but time after time, our economic policies left our workers on the short end of the stick."
Warren: In country after country, "faith in both capitalism and democracy has eroded"
Warren: "Policymakers promised that open markets would lead to open societies. Wow, did Washington get that one wrong."
Warren: "US trade policy has delivered one punch in the gut after another to workers and the unions that fight for those workers" https://t.co/Mdefu0mk3H
