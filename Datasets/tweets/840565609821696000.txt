@SilentNoMorePH Correct.
@Chicago1Ray Correct.
@ChmpMher Why wouldn't anybody destroy that big picture of a bum?
@bbusa617 Well, he allowed it because it's significance is President Trump is a baby in politics and wearing diaper means, he let others influenced his decisions just like somebody putting diaper on him.
@Braveheart_USA @ChristieC733 Opening up boarders is not just a "sandwich". Opening up boarders and establishing camaraderie and good relationship with fellow nations. US was created because of citizens from different nations. WHY STOP IT NOW AND CLOSE BORDERS?
@bayan_ncr @AnakpawisPL This is an offshoot of electing a president because of popularity not because of moral ascendancy. Why do ppl rally now? They should have been vigilant during elections and discard this president knowing he will not perform well on his presidency.
@Braveheart_USA @ChristieC733 The problem with the Trump administration if there are rallies in the US that calls for changes, the collaborators of Trump always connects it Clinton when it is not. Trump should stop his obsession of Clinton. He won the presidency, aren't he contented yet?

@DZMMTeleRadyo Nobody in his/her correct mind believes what you are saying about your "drug operation". Your drug operation is just a cover up of the drug business of the Dutertes. If you placed Pulong and Sarah's behind bars for drug trafficking, then that's the time we believe you.
@betseyklark That is the offshoot of electing a tyrant to presidency. He considers himself the owner of all places in the Philippines. Now who is to be blamed by this but the voters who allowed themselves to be mesmerized by the words of a bum like Duterte.
@Simply_Clinton WEll, Pinol is a corrupt person. I wonder why he was appointed as DA Secretary when all residents of North Cotabato knew his corruption. Maybe because he and Duterte are planning something on the rice cartel for their own vested interests.
@PinoyAkoBlog This lady who is wearing a "hijab" is not a Muslim. She's a kufr. Shame on you to use the hijab to serve your boss BBM's personal vested interests. VP Leni has been helping Muslims and you using a hijab is an insult to all Muslims VP Leni had helped.

@ExtremistWatch_ When a leader becomes a shahid, another one takes over. It is because Jihad goes on and on until Judgment Day. And Allah (swt) always choose a leader for the Mujahideens. So how can kufrs defeat Jihad? Never because it lives forever and ever. Ameen.
@ogie_rosa Duterte is an inutile president. Actually, he was just there as president to bury Marcos in the Libingan ng mga Bayani and to bring back the power of the Marcoses in the Phil. government. SO FILIPINOS BE WARNED OF DUTERTE'S REAL MOTIVE.
@LouisTabor3 @LandenSmith11 @realDonaldTrump Marcoses shouldn't be allowed to run for any government offices because of the crime committed by their father. The Legislative body should create a law banning families with government crimes to run for public office so that history will not repeat itself.
@arabnews @AzalinaOthmanS @NajibRazak That is a very laudable decision of Malaysia.
@DOTrPH WHO PROFITS IN THE MODERNIZATION? WHO LOSES MUCH ON THIS PROGRAM? MODERNIZATION SHOULD HAVE PASSED THROUGH PUBLIC HEARINGS NATIONWIDE TO KNOW THE REAL SCENARIO IN THE GROUND. NOT JUST PLAN IT TO SERVE THE INTERESTS OF DUTERTE'S CHINESE FRIENDS. AND OF COURSE, HIS BIG SHARE ON IT.
@Politiko_Ph The correct question is: WHERE DID THE BUDGET FOR MINDANAO GONE? WHAT DID THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNITS DO WITH THEIR BUDGET? WHERE DID THEY SPENT IT? JUST LIKE DAVAO CITY, WHERE DO THE BUDGET OF DC SPENT? THERE ARE NO MAJOR DEVTS IN DC FOR DECADES SINCE THE REIGN OF DUTERTES.

@huangjing_xu Marami sa Mindanao and di bumoto kay Duterte. Kasi kabisado baho nya. Kunwari peaceful ang davao pero talamak ang corruption. Kaya ayaw nila bitawan ang mayoralty kasi pag iba na anga makaupo, mabisto mga kurakot nilang dalawa ni Sarah.
@AmyMek HIJAB IS A MANIFESTATION OF WORSHIP TO ALLAH (SWT). SO NO ONE IN THIS DUNYA HAS THE RIGHT TO ORDER THE HIJAB TAKEN OFF. THIS IS A CLEAR VIOLATION OF THE BASIC RIGHT OF MUSLIMS AND AS A PEOPLE.
@JihadiInfo Anything that Anjem Choudhary did was for Allah (swt) of which he can never be guilty of. those who are guilty are the people who invaded the land of the Muslims and disrespect them. When this is done, every Muslim has the right to fight back when invaded.
@inquirerdotnet @FMangosingINQ That flag the AFP is tampering with bears the name of Allah (swt). You will be cursed with the way you treat it like garbage. Subhanallah. And it is not a siege when Maranaos want their land back usurped by the kufrs. You invaded Muslims so you'll expect Jihad becomes stronger.
@BoomBuencamino WELL THAT IS EXPECTED DRUG LORDS LIKE PETER LIM, ESPINOSA, ETC. ARE SERVING THEIR MASTER DRUG LORD, DUTERTE. DUTERTE IS THE MASTER DRUG LORD IN THE PHILIPPINES. HIS DRUG WAR IS A COVER UP OF HIS BIG DRUG BUSINESS. DO YOU THINK THE 6.8b SHABU PULONG RELEASED IS W/OUT HIS BLESSING?
@Jimparedes @rapplerdotcom Well, that what happens to leaders who chose to follow satan. They become misguided because their heart and mind is overflowing with sin. When people follow the ways of satan, Allah (swt) will close your heart and mind to any understanding of what is good. This is curse.
@Jimparedes YES EVERYBODY SHOULD SUPPORT THE OUTCRY FOR THE RESIGNATION OF AQUIRRE. HE'S DESTROYING THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE PHILIPPINES.
@MaamSyj If the ICC hadn't found reasons to investigate EJK in Phils, they will not investigate. But because evidences presented to ICC is real, they decided it warrants a full lenght investigation. ICC is a product of great scholars minds who crafted laws to serve justice worldwide.
@MaamSyj Yes of course. So do so scared.
@inquirerdotnet @JLeonenINQ Oh my paano na lang mga Duterte. Mahinto na ang paghasik ng lagim sa Davao. Mabisto na mga corruption sa city hall pag iba na ang mayor.
@PinoyAkoBlog Good. Panahon na putulin sungay ng babaing yan.
@altBBMemployee Tama ka dyan.
@Doc4Dead @pinoymommy Sinabi mo pa. Pinahiya nya mga Davaoeno.
@dzIQ990 @MMakalaladINQ Why do you believe every word Duterte promises to workers. He will not sign EO because most of businessman practicing contractualization are Chinese businessmen. He will not hear workers outcry, rather, he prefer to give what Chinese wants because he has cuts in their businesses.
@InqNational @AnakpawisPL It was wrong for the Maranaos to support the AFP during the war last year. They betrayed their Muslim brothers in exchange with friendship with Kufrs and Munafiqs. So now the result of their betrayal, they will be driven away from their lands by the very ppl they sided with.
@InqNational @AnakpawisPL I told you Duterte administration is up for something. Maranaos of Marawi will soon realize a Maranao sold them. The Maranaos are being evicted from their lands by so-called rehab plans and programs. The rehab is not for the Maranao but for the AFP.

@TrillanesSonny The truth is: DUTERTE IS A DRUG LORD, THE MASTER OF DRUG LORDS. He ordered execution of Espinosa because he's a competitor. Duterte's DRUG WAR is a cover up to hide his being involved in drugs.
@TrillanesSonny Sen. Trillanes is absolutely right. Honestly, Duterte is now scared. In this world, we have a very popular saying that goes: CRIME DOES NOTE PAY. AND NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW EVEN A PRESIDENT. Duterte will be caught up with his genocide against Filipinos. You'll see.
@rapplerdotcom Naku paano ka mag withdraw Digong eh may kaso ka sa ICC. Malapit ka na makalaboso. Idamay mo pa Pilipinas sa katarantaduhan mo. For your info we filipinos wala kami paki kung mag withdraw ka. Mag withdraw ka mag isa mo.

@LivesMatterPH @PunchTheLies @EggTarTisYummy @braniacthoughts @KatarHol5 @iAmSuperCis @OcaBacs @EmilioDJacinto @__Anak_Wispa @Virgo07Warrior Absolutely right. To all the AFP who are still loyal to our country: Duterte betrayed this country to China. Why don't you arrest Duterte and bring him in a public court so the 94 million Filipinos be the judge of his treason.
@kikopangilinan Those who insult the spirit of EDSA are insulting the people who joined in the revolution to restore democracy in this country, and I am one of them. We fought hard, with blood and tears in EDSA. So, to all who ridicule EDSA, get out of Phil. and GO TO HELL.
@VeneeR58 @kikopangilinan Not only influence, Duterte has SOPs on all businesses in Davao City. Try investigating and you will know the truth. they actually use the government to enhanced their businesses i.e. Duterte, Sarah, Pulong. They thought Davao City is their own personal city.
@hoydlee @ilda_talk WEll, that's the problem with you , you blame dilawan when it is dutertetards who should be blame. Don't throw your own dirt to others. And I am not a dilawan, I am a Filipino who fought hard for our freedom. You, who are you? One of the betrayers of this country. Damn you.
@kikopangilinan Duterte is spreading on his speeches among davaoenos that EDSA is useless and FVR was corrupt and has no accomplishment. He even said,among all presidents, he is the only one who had accomplishments. What a liar this Duterte. FVR's time, economy soared high compared to him now.
@johnny_grooves3 @ilda_talk Ikaw ang manigas. Pag matangal si Sereno ibig sabihin wala nang totoong hustisya dito sa Pilipinas. Saan ka tatakbo kung ikaw maging biktima ng mga pang aapi, sa mga justices na namumulitika? Gamitin mo utak mo pare wag mo ilagay sa puwitan mo.
@TrillanesSonny Absolutely correct. It seems justices now are not performing within the bounds of the constitution but are making moves on the dictates of tyrant. Pity these justices.
@hoydlee @ilda_talk Well, that is politicizing, my dear. What is the guarantee that Court En Banc still has credibility? Every justices now, there's only few we can trust. Most of the justices are moving within the dictates of the dictator.
@RMontajes15 Correct. LOL.
@CGTNOfficial Good decision.
@joketerte30 See, I told you so. Duterte keeps on criticizing H.E. President Fidel V. Ramos. But haven't you known Duterte that it was during Tabako's time when Philippines became THE ECONOMIC TIGER of Asia. Even China and Japan were not able to compete during his administration.
@ilda_talk NOT CORRUPT? WHO SAID SO???
@momblogger Honestly, it's COOL.
@gmanews @_jamesJA @dzbb Good. I thought FIGHT FOR FREEDOM, the spirit of EDSA, died down with Duterte rising. But I am so happy the new generation light the fire again of EDSA, the fruit of our tears and blood. GO GO GO WE RALLY BEHIND.
@LivesMatterPH @gmanews One more thing. Duterte keeps on lambasting the US for their stay here. Honestly, if the US is not here protecting us, Philippines had been invaded long time ago by Communist China. And we will be under a communist rule wherein it implements a one-child policy.
P2.4 milyon lang di na pinalarga. Kinuha pa ang pera nila eh si Quiboloy $350,000 dala dala niya sa private jet niya palabas at pabalik ng Pinas di kinumpiska. Ibig sabihin pinipili lang ang hinuhuli. Sigurado mawawala naman yang pera na yan di mabalik sa may ari.
@ilda_talk Mahirap sa inyo para lang maka sipsip kay Duterte pati kasama nyo sinisiraan nyo. Alam mo pag nagturo ka sa isang tao tatlong daliri mo ang nagtuturo sa iyo. Sino ang mas may tinatago di ikaw na nagtuturo.
@ilda_talk Regarding SALN why are you pinpointing just CJ Sereno? There are many justices who don't report correctly their SALN. Even Duterte is not reporting his true SALN. And why would she explain her SALN to the justices? CJ Sereno should report her SALN in a proper venue.

@ilda_talk Whatever differences members of judiciary have against a CJ, they should have settled it in their confines to preserve the sanctity for what Supreme Court stood for. When you publicized your negativeness, it means you want to be in politics not in a judiciary. So better quit.
@ilda_talk Well, if there are members of the Judiciary who can't stand CJ Sereno, why do you have to drag your negative attitude against her in public? Haven't you known judiciary esp. Supreme Court should maintain its integrity since its the last bastion of justice citizen can depend on?

@nad0227 @serrano_rene Well, many of us who fought hard in the EDSA revolution are not yet too old to OUSTER ANOTHER DICTATOR. Let be our outcry and goal from now on: OUSTER DUTERTE AND LET HIM PAY FOR THE GENOCIDE HE DID TO FILIPINOS.

@DanSantos8 Well, lucky for Marcos they have US to run to. In the case of Duterte, when he gets ousted he had no country to run to (maybe China but unlikely) except under the dress of her "the other women". He's been lambasting U.S. surely, they will not accept Duterte for exile.

@momblogger Sarah Duterte is too arrogant now because she thinks his father is a president, she can do everything. However, WATCH when Duterte is 6 feet on the ground, she will be hiding forever like the Marcoses to prevent people they trampled DO REVENGE.

@JRDCastillo24 Lol
@mariaressa @rapplerdotcom Correction pls not US-Duterte but CHINA-DUTERTE.
@senyorgustav0 @bongbongmarcos Correct. When a pregnant woman was raped by AFP during Marcos time, we sought help to place them behind bars. Nothing happened bcoz the AFP are his dogs unleashed to follow his orders similar to what Duterte is doing now.
@politikovismin DUTERTE THOUGHT HE CAN LIVE FOREVER AND BECOME A DICTATOR FOREVER AND NOGRALES, ALVAREZ, PIMENTEL, FARINAS, ETC. PRESUMED THEY TOO CAN BE IN POWER FOREVER. YOU'RE ALL BLIND. DUTERTE IS JUST A FEW STEPS FROM HIS GRAVE AND WHEN THIS HAPPENS, ALL OF YOU WILL REAP WHAT YOU SOW.

@AsecMargauxUson Embracing his daughter first before the Indian investors does. His first "virgin" offering to the Indian investors.
@Tiver_A Yes, you're right. Who knows Kitty, her daughter, will be his first offering to Indian investors. A sex maniac like Duterte can't even be trusted with his children.
@politikovismin LOL. Nograles one and same with Duterte why he backs up Duterte's dirty tricks. Nograles also a corrupt politician.
@News5AKSYON @MaamSyj GO GO GO WE RALLY BEHIND.
@ogie_rosa HEY GORDON &amp; GATCHALIAN. DON'T TELL THE UPians WHAT TO DO. THEY ARE MORE BRAINY THAN YOU. IF NOT FOR THE UP STUDENTS IN 1970s, THE TWO OF YOU WILL NOT BE SITTING ON YOUR CHAIR RIGHT NOW. SHAME ON YOU TWO. YOU'RE THE ONE ENJOYING WHAT THE UP HAD WORKED HARD IN THE PAST.
@News5AKSYON Absolutely correct.
@mukipstocks @kikopangilinan Well, you were not there when UPians moved in 1970s to fight against injustices of this government and dictatorship of Marcos. Excuse me, your mockery of the UPians is unacceptable. Trace back history. Not just comment of what you see now.
@kikopangilinan Yes, of course. UP is the school that mold future leaders and we cannot discount the brainy people who joined revolution to overhaul the government rotten system by joining the EDSA revolution. Honestly, there are no rebels, protesters, etc. if political leaders are good.
@AsecMargauxUson @MaamSyj See the tyrant? I hope he dies earlier so he can stop harassing the Filipino people particularly the young generation.
@rapplerdotcom He's absolutely RIGHT.
@PinoyAkoBlog @fthilbay I guess voting Senators is not the solution to Philippine politics. The best way is to create a people's court from the masses for every barangay who will enact laws and policies for their own community. This is gud alternative for senatongs &amp; tongressmen.
@DZMMTeleRadyo @JohnsonManabat Why is it that only Mark Taguba is behind bars? How about Pulong Duterte and Sarah's Duterte's husband, Mans? They're the big players of the P28 billion shabu scam.
@PTVph Duterte has no right to Carandang suspension coz it's he who's being investigated re:bank accounts. When a President hoards/corrupts Filipino people's taxes, it is the Ombudsman who should investigate the President &amp; put him behind bars. With the suspension, Duterte's guilty.
@Politiko_Ph @RRD_Davao Yes, ISIS and NPA are not different from each other because the two are both fighting a dictator and a tyrant because of the cruelty he had done to the Filipino people. In my opinion it is more safer to join these groups than AFP/PNP who stabs /kill their people at the back.
@JonathanAndal_ @BayanMuna @dwiz882 The PNP/AFP only incarcerates freedom-loving people but they don't place behind bars shabu scammers and corruptors. It is because they get paid by these bad people while the freedom fighters don't have money to fill their butts. That's why people don't trust anymore AFP/PNP.
@cnnphilippines Correct. The Legislative body is separate and distinct from the Executive body. That is the ruling on powers. However, Duterte is a MORON and do not know the law even if he is a lawyer. That is the problem with bad leaders, they're blinded with WISDOM.

@yusufledesma Filipinos support Carandang in bringing out what the truth about Duterte's bank accounts. FREEZE DUTERTE'S AND HIS FAMILY BANK ACCOUNTS NOW.
@rapplerdotcom Now let us see whose eyes are rolling. Duterte thought he owns the la and nobody will dare fright him in court. Shame on Duterte to harass Rappler but fail to incarcerate his son and daughter's husband for the P28 billion shabu scam. Shame on Duterte.
@FilY0 @Chip2chip2 @KenCallawood @braniacthoughts @teta_limcangco @DanSantos8 @KSPjnsxtn @yusufledesma @Gabgrielle @AsecMargauxUson Well, at least we still have a government official who is  sane and know what is correct from wrong. I salute Morales. Go go go Morales, we rally behind.
@DanSantos8 That shows that Duterte is the worst president we ever had.

@zehven07 @ABSCBNNews @OujiGaiden @rongagalac Correct.
@ABSCBNNews @rongagalac Whatever evidence Marcoses show to Filipinos, believing him is unlikely. It is because the Marcoses destroyed the very essence of TRUST which is higher and most precious than wealth.
@business Yes. Theresa May is one of a kind.
@silentn0m0re Duterte administration has no funds for research but he has funds for his whore.
@FoxNews @nikkihaley @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump Well, who's guilty of too much politics? Isn't it Nick Haley, the mouthpiece of a psychopath president.
@jcpunongbayan Well, it's almost a year since the impeachment complain against Duterte, Filipino people can file again another impeachment, but this time it should be the supreme court or people's court who will process it not the tongressmen Umali, Farinas, etc.
@yusufledesma That's expected with Duterte. He wants to silence all witnesses of his corruption, murders and tyranny. If Duterte dies, many will spit on his grave.
@IskanderRehman Correct.
@Arab_News Good decision.
@USA_AllenK @bgood12345 @OliverMcGee @JackPosobiec @AlanDersh IT WAS AMERICA WHO DESTROYED MUSLIM LANDS AND OBAMA IS NOT A MUSLIM LIKE OSAMA BIN LADIN. OSAMA IS AMIRUL MUJAHIDEEN WHILE OBAMA IS A KUFR.
@JrcheneyJohn WHEN ALLAH (SWT) CREATED THE WORLD, THERE ARE NO BOUNDARIES OR BORDERS OR RACIAL DISCRIMINATION. IT'S BECAUSE OF WEALTHY GREEDY PEOPLE WHO MADE MAN-MADE LAWS TO BORDERS SO AS TO CONTROL CREATION. ANY PRESIDENTS, LEADERS WHO MAKES BOUNDARIES ON THIS EARTH ARE OF SATAN NOT ALLAH.

@News5AKSYON WE DON'T BELIEVE IN THIS CONGRESS AS LEGIT TO PROCESS IMPEACHMENT. IT IS BECAUSE CONGRESSMEN UMALI, FARINAS, ETC ARE ALL CORRUPT POLITICIANS. THEY WANT TO DESTROY cj SERENO &amp; SUPREME COURT SO THAT THEY WILL NOT BE RUN AFTER THEIR CORRUPTION BY SUPREME COURT.
@InegMa1307 @AShary THAT IS HEARSAY. PRESIDENT AQUINO IS INNOCENT OF THE ACCUSATIONS. THE ONE TO BE INCARCERATED IS THE HEAD OF DOH WHO DID NOT DO PROPER RESEARCH ON THE VACCINE. IT IS HIS/HER ROLE TO INVESTIGATE NOT THE PRESIDENT'S.

@manilabulletin @alexsj_MB THE LAPDOGS OF DUTERTE.
@cnnphilippines Well, PNP now and AFP are lapdogs of Duterte so what ever he says to them, they're like dogs who follow the dictator's orders. PNP &amp; AFP are not serving the interests of the Filipino taxpayers but serving the interest of Duterte and his family and friends ONLY.
LET US START EDSA III REVOLUTION BY NOT PAYING TAXES TO THIS GOVERNMENT. THE FILIPINOS ARE NOT THE ONES BENEFITING FROM THESE TAXES BUT CORRUPT OFFICIALS AND DUTERTE'S ADMIN.
@DanSantos8 How to start with EDSA III revolution, ALL FILIPINOS STOP PAYING TAXES TO THE GOVERNMENT.
@DanSantos8 Yes, and that can be done by joining hands and start EDSA III.
@realDonaldTrump Yes, your tax reform was made just for the betterment of businesses but not the good of the american masses: the middle and low income earners, healthcare, the veterans, old folks, education, etc. You're wrong with your policies.

@PhilippineStar CJ Sereno is a good person and an honest one. We'd prefer CJ Sereno than the other justices who'd rather play politics than do their jobs in seeking justice for the Filipino people. These justices who wants to destroy Supreme Court should take off their robes. Shame on you.
@bbusa617 why don't you do it now if your accusation is true. The fact is all are just ALLEGATIONS against Hillary Clinton and not one proof of evidence proven in the court of law. American people are not all moron who instantly believe what you say. We also have brains to think.
@GrizzleMeister Correct.
@rapplerdotcom The first woman Duterte should give to the investors is his daughter Kitty and his granddaughter Isabelle, if they are still virgins.
@News5AKSYON Well, I told you don't be surprised if his daughter, Kitty, is offered to investors.
@usembassymanila @manilabulletin The US Embassy keeps delivering guns and ammos to the real terrorist in this country, the AFP and PNP.
@IWillRedPillYou @bgood12345 @JudgeJeanine Really? I don't believe you.
@PhelimKine The real reason Duterte declared Martial Law in Mindanao is he wants all lumads and Muslims out of their lands because he wants to dig buried treasures per collaboration with Japanese. In SPMC Davao City, Duterte got a big share of the treasure taken by the Japanese.
@Pulitika2010 During the Aquino administration, passport processing was easy and no sweat. Now, You'll sweat all over but yet you cannot renew your passport for weeks. Cayetano blaming Aquino administration is bullshit. Duterte administration was the worst Philippines ever had.

@Makabayan_Enan @KatarHol5 Philippines is just too lucky, the US did not yet confiscated Philippines considering the huge debt we have with US. But China, if Philippines incur debt with them, even how small, they will invade the whole Philippines and make slaves Filipinos. Be warned.
@FoxNews Hos about spending that %25 billion to low and middle income earners as well as delivery of basic services to the American people. You don't need to build borders. If you want to stop illegal immigrants, increase border patrols.

@rapplerdotcom Well, Duterte is the only one rejecting it, not the Filipino people. It is because he cannot hold this funds to suit his own personal interests. This president should not reject any grant from EU without the permission of the Filipino people.
@gmanews Of course, we detest you Mocha. Haven't you known that all along. You're the most despicable ape in the Philippines together with your boss.
@ProblemaNiJDC @bongbongmarcos Yes, performance on how to cheat the Filipino people like burying his father in the "Libingan ng mga Bayani". And disrespectful too because Marcoses didn't ask permission from the Filipino people to bury a dictator in the most sacred place of Philippines. Shame on Duterte.

@natashya_g @pinoymommy @rapplerdotcom Rappler or any other media outlet in the world shouldn't be stopped. They're the mouthpiece of FREEDOM and a means to destroy tyranny and dictatorship. Rappler as an org. is stopped but not the voice of truth and freedom which it stands for. SEC IS A LOSER Y THEY STOPPED RAPPLER.
@EyeOnExtremists True. No man-made government can withstand a group guided by Allah (swt). That's a fact and it was written in the Holy Qur'an, Mujahidins will achieved victory in this Dunya and so is Islam, the last religion that will stand in Judgment Day.

@jboygonzalessj Well, Robin tell that also to your boss Duterte. He is also doing suicide for the Chinese. Pa drug war kunwari pero anak niya at asawa ng anak niya involved sa drug trafficking. I wonder how Robin can be with people of Satan when he claims to be a Muslim?
@TrillanesSonny Well, that is the problem with some Filipinos, they believed false  facts rather than truth. Pity they were misled by a tyrant and a slave of Satan, Duterte. Expect Philippines to go down the drain.
@MangHuseng It's baloney.
@johnpavlovitz Correct.
@terrorwatch1 ISIS did not went down, rather, they expanded and merged with revolutionary groups worldwide. This is the real scenario. Further, Al Qaeda and ISIS are one and same.
@20committee Yes. But when you elect a President, you gave full authority for him to deal with anybody. That's why choosing a President should be within the bounds of morality and steadfastness, always what is best for citizenry.
@iamkarendavila Well, for the intellects of sciences, chewing a gum manifests psychological instability and guilt of something. Gum chewing supresses physical reactions to these.
@rapplerdotcom Calida won't submit documentations because there are many injustices this administration did to innocent ppl and Supreme Court has full powers to incarcerate them.
@PunchTheLies @_QuePasaChica_ @EmilioDJacinto @mila_d_aguilar @AsecMargauxUson @FilY0 @iAmSuperCis @TataOjie @LivesMatterPH @Gabgrielle @xenohemlock Hon Alejano is right. Filipinos should stand up with DFA's betrayal against the Filipino people.
@teta_limcangco Hoy Sassot, President Aquino is far more better than your Duterte. You don't have the right to ridicule PNoy. You haven't served the country like he did. Watch your mouth. Kahit nasa dulo ka ng mundo kaya ka namin kuyugin pagdating ng araw.
@EmilioDJacinto @1abuazzam That is expected of Duterte. WALA NGANG PAKIALAM YAN SA MGA ANAK SA MGA PILIPINO PA KAYA.
@SkyNews Trump and Duterte are just the same, cursing in public when they get cornered by issues. It manifests WEAK LEADERSHIP.
@JihadiInfo The Shariah Law is based in the Holy Qur'an which laws came from Allah (swt) and can never be like man-made laws.
@DailyMail @MailOnline A very principled and dignified decision. We salute.
@TIME CORRECT.
@rapplerdotcom That is one result of Philippine Economy going down the drain.
@xenohemlock It is because the President, the Senators and Congressman DON'T KNOW FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT of Filipino people's taxes and they corrupt our money to their heart's content.
@OcaBacs This administration failed to deliver basic services to these poor people. we should stop paying taxes because nothing good was derived from paying them. We just augmented more corruption on this administration, the senate, the congress, etc.
@washingtonpost My, my, my. So tax reform made by Republicans was for Trump's tax cuts only not for the betterment of the U.S. citizens especially the poor.
@yusufledesma @inquirerdotnet Filipinos should protest against this.
@kikopangilinan With regards to federalism espoused by Pimentel &amp; others, we still opt for AUTONOMY than federalism.
@kikopangilinan You can overhaul constitution a million times but if leaders who are given authority to change it are CROOKED, no chance of successful implementation. Honestly, any tinkering just suits Duterte's wishes not the people.
@kikopangilinan Before any charter change or tinkering of the Constitution, the current legislative leaders should first tinker with their own morality and steadfastness. Seems all leaders now are just serving Duterte's wishes not for the Filipino people as a whole.
@TIME Absolutely.
@tr1pnautic Don't be misled or tempted by the mistress of the devil, Mocha.
@tr1pnautic Correct so beware.
@AltTeamAFP Well, i told you so. Binobola lang ni Duterte mga sundalo para pumayag silang maging uto-uto nya. Pati utot ni Duterte inaamoy ng AFP. Dapat ang sundalo para serbisyo sa bayan kasi buwis ng tao nanggaling sahod niyo.
@lahingpnoy Both: drugs and debt.
@FilY0 Correct.
@fthilbay Funny, legislators did not scrutinize well train. It is because they're too busy serving the tyrant.
@fthilbay Correct.
@cnnphilippines Correct.
@gmanews Prices of Coca-Cola already increased. Imagine 1 liter of Coke now cost in retail P35.00 each. Others are selling it at P40.00. This is the result of the Duterte Tax Reform. All prices of basic commodities soared high.

The government is responsible to find ways and means to lower prices of gasoline. But then, that wl never happen bcoz Duterte already spent billions in his travels and drug wars at d expense of taxpayers.
@PhilstarNews I hope this fund goes directly to beneficiaries not to the pockets of Local Government Units with collaboration from Malacanang.
@micorstse The policemen during the presidency of Ramos are dignified and disciplined. Now, with PNP Chief Bato on the lead, the PNP hierarchy became scalawags and unruly.
@MaculaDensa_ That is what we call professionalism. The LP's are professional people compared to Duterte and his followers. They were not taught good moral character by their parents so they grew up like morons even if they're educated.
@PhilippineStar @realDonaldTrump Well, I have been in Trump's office no button there. Bluffing is unbecoming to a president especially one who rules the most powerful country in the world. You'll be a laughing stock.
@DMRDynamics @TrueFactsStated @MelissaKester What took Americans so long to realize that Trump is a deranged person unfit for presidency. Better Americans have voted for Clinton, lesser evil and sane.
@bloody_vision WEll, just like what Duterte said during his campaign, "he is a Chinese, too." So, Filipinos expect this country be sold out by Duterte to the Chinese.
@MrFrankBaraan @AsecMargauxUson @PunchTheLies @donthebasher @MyRizalPH @DanSantos8 @PinoyAkoBlog @jakeagravante @SuperficialGZT @KatarHol5 @mila_d_aguilar Remember the saying, "BIRDS WITH THE SAME FEATHERS FLOCKED TOGETHER!" If the president is immoral, naturalmente the followers are immoral too. That goes with Gatchalian, etc...
@leahnavarro @rapplerdotcom If it is truth, it hurts. Words thrown against Gatchalian might be true that's why it hurts.
@fthilbay Correction please. Ramos never entered into any compromise agreement with the Marcoses and their billions even if Marcoses and Ramoses are relatives. Even if you're relative, you are ex-communicated from them if you did a heinous crime, that's the Ramoses, a good name is vry impt

@SyLicoNgaAko NCCC has a history of its building always burned. Remember the Kimball Plaza in General Santos City? NCCC owned it and they got millions pay out from insurance. Question: Was the fire really an accident or accidentally insurance incident?
@LivesMatterPH Funny, the threat of the father to resign was actually the son who did. Trying to run away from his crimes, Paolo thought resigning will erase all accusations, but he seems to forget CRIME DOES NOT PAY.
@yusufledesma @gmanews Well, if Paolo Duterte resigns, it just mean HE IS GUILTY OF THE SHABU SHIPMENT AND ALL THE OTHER ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HIM I.E. TRIAD MEMBERSHIP. Nevertheless, no one is above the law. There is always a time for retribution and punishment for him.
@yusufledesma You're absolutely correct.
@realDonaldTrump @GartrellLinda YOU,TRUMP DID NOT MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN RATHER YOU DESTROYED AMERICA AND SHAMED THE COUNTY TO THE WORLD. YOU'RE UNFIT TO BECOME PRESIDENT OF U.S. YOU BETTER RESIGN BEFORE YOU BRING AMERICA TO OBLIVION.
@inquirerdotnet Subhanallah.
@KenRoth I don't think so. UN isn't affected by Trump bullying because the one who benefits destruction/demolition is Trump. With Trump's decision, HE UNITED ALL MUSLIMS AND JIHADISTS IN THE WHOLE WORLD and the one who'll suffer with Trump's arrogant decision are the citizens of America.
@KenRoth UN is not scared of Trump's threat/bullying. Rather, it should be Trump who should be afraid of the UN General Assembly rejecting him. There will sure be repercussions but demolition/destruction benefits Trump not the UN.

@interaksyon @yusufledesma I told you so. AFP's propaganda of "untouched" surrenderees and POWs from rebel groups is not true. It's better fighting for your cause than surrender and be tortured by AFP captors. In Islam, a Mujahid who surrenders to an enemy betrays his religion.
@yusufledesma Correct. Honestly, internationally, Davao Boys murderers are now known worldwide. Watch what will be the effect to Duterte and Davao City. For sure, Davao City w/c was once bragged a "peaceful city" will become "home of Duterte's hitmen".

@mariaressa @rapplerdotcom Nevertheless, the tyrant is a few steps from his grave. Surely, when he finally get to his grave, he will left behind his family at the mercy of those people who would like to avenge for what this tyrant did to them. So don't feel miserable, justice is always served from Allah.
@mariaressa @rapplerdotcom That is expected from a tyrant and a dictator administration. If you oppose Duterte's tyranny, he will manipulate congress. But opposition should be vigilant and make stronger their outcry to fight a dictator. Remember EDSA, people volunteered to ouster a dictator.

@rapplerdotcom CPP-NPA is different from ISIS. The former are the oppressed citizens of this government while the latter is a group that protects and defends aggression against Islam.

@lahingpnoy Another thing, there is a treasure buried somewhere inside Marawi City and Duterte is determined to unearthed it at whatever cost. This is also the reason why he went to Japan to negotiate his cut on this treasure just like that found in SPMC Davao City.
@lahingpnoy That is the reason why Martial Law was extended so that Duterte and his chosen contractors can find a way how to slice the budget intended for Marawi City to their own pockets.

@rapplerdotcom These four Senators really have respected the sanctity of the Edsa Revolution. The other Senators who voted for extension made the biggest mistake. For every death of a Filipino will be on their conscience and people do not forget.
@Inq_Opinion @jnery_newsstand Yes, with the extension of martial law Filipinos are doomed and not even one Senator or Congressman can help them. Filipinos should now rely in their own hands to fight the dictatorship.
@bandila So all the Legislative body now are stupid. Nevertheless, ML will bring down Mindanao's economy to oblivion and that is what Luzon and Visayas wants, to see Mindanao destroy itself through Duterte's Martial Law.
@ndame1112 In our opinion, the tyrant must be replaced now because he's dragging the Philippine Republic down which will result to a big disaster in the future for Filipinos.
@politico That's correct.
@ApoTerry I guess the sanest person currently in the government now is CJ Sereno. They want her down so that she could not run after corrupt congressmen and murders of this administration. Almost all senators and congressmen are in cahoots with mass murders of Filipinos except for few.
@ANCALERTS @iamkarendavila Correct. It is the role of DOH to assess if it is good or not. Why do we pay R &amp; D if it is not being utilized by DOH? Do you mean DOH is just wasting taxes of Filipino people? DOH should be held liable.
@ceso They are note afraid of CJ Sereno. They're lying against Sereno why they bring their grievances on wrong venue. SC justices should respect each other &amp; not backbite CJ because the Supreme Court is the last bastion of justice when the Executive department corrupts and do mischief.
@betseyklark @ABSCBNNews Yes, that's true. There are countries who hate Duterte and with that picture of him on the ID, OFWs sure will have a big problem.
@MarionA56n It is because Gordon don't know or haven't learned ethics and good moral character. In other words, a MORON.
@yusufledesma That's expected if you're a relative of the tyrant's administration. Phil situation is getting worse. Filipinos should unite now and ouster the tyrant and install a much better, compassionate, dignified leader who will salvage this country from oblivion.
@rapplerdotcom Well, that is Pacquiao whose surrounded by bodyguards, a wealthy man and an ally of the tyrant. How about those poor Filipinos and Muslims who are now being harassed by AFP, PNP and local government officials? In Davao City now, Muslims are being stalked by Barangay officials.

@yusufledesma That is expected bro. With a mass murderer as president, foreign nationals will shy away. Right now barangay captains and kagawads in Davao city stalks all Muslims residing in the city. Isn't this a vilation, may I ask?
@24OrasGMA Good for him. At least they can revenge the killings of PNP of innocent civilians.
@NUSPhilippines The dictator is starting his genocide against people fighting for justice.
@ABSCBNNews @InaReformina Coming from aquirre, this document is bullshit. How can CPP-NPA a terrorist when it is being supported by communist China and Russia of whom Duterte is trying hard to get help.
@condeHRW Filipinos beware of this PNP app.
@PhelimKine @hrw Now that drug war is back to PNP, I guess all Filipino civilians should take arms to protect themselves from PNP murderers. And Filipinos should work hand in hand to fight back these PNP butchers of Duterte. Filipinos be not afraid anymore of the tyranny of Duterte. fight back.
@mrsunlawyer Ang kapal naman ng mukha ng Exec Secretary magpa summer house pa eh kawawang pinoy ubos ang buwis sa kapritso ng mga opisyal.
@FilY0 Because they are followers of Satan. Ala-Satanas din ang mga mukha gaya ni Duterte.
@gmanews Well, another year and half of the Filipino people get killed.
@DanSantos8 All those promises are a facade of what his real intention was.
@FilY0 As if PNP believe in God. Maybe a false god like Duterte of whom PNP follow orders with a blind eye for justice.
@MarionA56n Korek ka jan bro.
@AsecMargauxUson @DanSantos8 @donthebasher @BoomBuencamino @lahingpnoy @PunchTheLies @FilY0 @OcaBacs @LivesMatterPH @MrFrankBaraan @MyRizalPH Truly, it was written that in the last days of this dunya, false leaders will rise up and mischief is strewn all over the earth. So, Muslims already knew leaders now are all corrupt, murderers, etc..But woe to them for there will be a painful retribution from the Almighty.
@MarionA56n That's a good decision for Trump. Transparency is key to leadership. That's why Duterte should sign the bank waiver so that Filipinos will have privy to his bank information and that nothing is being hoarded. If he refuse, then he's hiding something.

@gerald_santos_ @yusufledesma @MSarahadil @LivesMatterPH You dont need cover up on what Duterte says or do. Each and everyone shall be responsible of his own acts on day of judgment.
@yusufledesma @MSarahadil @LivesMatterPH In Islam never ever say words that will hurt feelings of ppl because you wl be held accountable on the day of judgment.
@Rajo1118 @yusufledesma @MSarahadil @LivesMatterPH Lol
@yusufledesma True
@MSarahadil @VeneeR58 @yusufledesma @LivesMatterPH I dont think so sister. You're just lucky to have good business at Davao and connection in cthol. But majority are not agreeable to what Duterte now is doing.
@VeneeR58 @MSarahadil @yusufledesma @LivesMatterPH Correct.
@Inq_Opinion Really!!! Panelo must have learned law the other way around. Truly, the blindfold of justice is now taken off and eyes are rolling to who pays bigger fee.
@yusufledesma @MSarahadil @Rajo1118 @LivesMatterPH You are correct. In rules of war in Islam, Allah prohibits even the burning of trees and mutilation and attacks on Mosques, Sanctuaries, Monasteries, Monks, Priests, Imams, etc. However, with Duterte he ordered destruction of all these things prohibited by Allah (swt).
@MarionA56n Why only Taguba? How about Paolo Duterte and Mans Carpio? Does it mean they have immunity of this crime? If that is so, then hope DOJ burn in hellfire.
@News5AKSYON Talk is cheap Harry. Show us! From what I have observed, your words cannot be trusted anymore. You learned to lie just like your boss, so i for one don't believe what you say.
@yusufledesma @MSarahadil @LivesMatterPH When a Muslim joins Jihad, he/she is now a Mujahid, meaning, protector and defender of Islam in this dunya and making supreme the Law of Allah (swt). Anyone who turns their back from this Jihad betrays Allah (swt).
@yusufledesma @MSarahadil @LivesMatterPH Ameen.
@VinceNonatoINQ @SPAMelaHam @reyumali @inquirerdotnet Atty. Gadon is one example of a person who placed in his butt his principle and joined others in swimming a toxic murky water with his boss. What a waste of education and knowledge all through the years.
@gmanews @MaamSyj @jpsoriano Go go go Senator. WE rally behind.
@yusufledesma @MSarahadil @LivesMatterPH Speaking against a tyrant and wrong doer is Jihad, brother. And Jihad is obligatory in this dunya for all Muslims. However, many don't know really what Jihad is. So they collaborate with Kufrs and Murtads because of ignorance of the laws of Allah (swt).
@JihadiInfo You cannot ban the Sharia Law. It is the law of Allah (swt). And there will be a corresponding punishment for those who bans Sharia Law.
@yusufledesma @TitaHazQueen @MSarahadil @LivesMatterPH Ameen.
@kaeofficial Justice system in the Philippines thrown down the drain upon Duterte's sworing in. Pity the poor Filipino people who will be mostly affected by injustices.
@PunchTheLies @MrFrankBaraan @PinoyAkoBlog @mila_d_aguilar @_QuePasaChica_ @EmilioDJacinto @FilY0 @AsecMargauxUson @DanSantos8 @LivesMatterPH @1abuazzam A very sensible leader. At least, Ceasar Chavez made the difference among  Duterte's appointees.
@MSarahadil @yusufledesma @LivesMatterPH Duterte lied to people in numerous ways. Guess, he don't know what is the punishment for this. A must watch video: https://t.co/3pdIpgwE0S (Punishment of a Liar)
Lying Is Tantamount To Disbelief. To Duterte and all the liars in this dunya....watch this video. https://t.co/2gqyd7dOGx
@yusufledesma Before a person dies, he will see all his sins and right after the last 40 steps of the mourner departs, Munkar and Nakir will start the questioning and punishment for what a person did in dunya.
@MSarahadil @yusufledesma @LivesMatterPH Ameen.
@yusufledesma @MSarahadil @LivesMatterPH Duterte absolutely has ties with DDS. We knew that in Davao City. One of the contending mayor backed out because he was threatened by his DDS. But like I told you, all sins in dunya will have its day of reckoning and crimes of Duterte will have a painful retribution from Allah.
RT @yusufledesma: @LivesMatterPH @MSarahadil Furthermore according to sworn testimony in d Senate Duterte has previously ordered his DDS to…
@yusufledesma @LivesMatterPH @MSarahadil That is a heinous crime in the eyes of Allah.  Subhanallah. One day Duterte will reap what he sow.
@yusufledesma @LivesMatterPH @MSarahadil Thats true. And even how bad a person is, nobody was given authority by Allah to kill anybody or anything of His creation.
@PinoyAkoBlog Kahit mag aral ng mag-aral si Mocha di pa rin mabago ang pagiging bobo nya. Makapasa lang yan sa law school kung bayaran ni Duterte mga teachers nya.
@lahingpnoy Impeachment case against Chief Sereno is a political issue. Umali and his band of corrupt congressmen wants Sereno impeach so that justice system in Philippines is destroyed and no one will go after them and Duterte for their crimes.
@AJEnglish Well, i hope victims of Duterte's genocide in Philippines will also be given justice and bring Duterte sentenced with life in prison just like Rakto Miadic.
@KatarHol5 Funny, Faeldon was placed behind bars while Paolo Duterte goes scot-free on the smuggle of P6.4/28.9 billion shabu. Injustices is rampant in this administration.
@SilentNoMorePH Lol
@attymeltweet Correct.
@News5AKSYON Well Harry Roque should take seriously this warning. He might end up his tongue cut and placed on his butt.
@BakeroSaEanas @FilY0 Yes
@srsasot Of course. Sen Risa has the right to demand exact numbers. And who are you to question the Senators request? Nakabit ka lang ni Duterte lumaki na ulo mo.
@DuterteWatchdog Moron nga eh kaya di alam ano ang dresscode.

@FilY0 @PunchTheLies @yusufledesma @Gabgrielle @D0D0NNA @Chip2chip2 @AsecMargauxUson @DanSantos8 @teta_limcangco @KatarHol5 @braniacthoughts Correct.

@SyLicoNgaAko Lol. Just like what i said, the Dutertes are caught up with their crimes.
@rapplerdotcom Lol. Alvarez maybe is one of her customers in 'pole" why alvarez praises Mocha.
@PhilippineStar Sereno is the last bastion for justice. Why would she appear in Congress when tongressman are all corrupt.
@fthilbay Well Duterte is a morom of d constitution. He makes his laws which defines him as an arrogant moron.
@tweetybeauty @rapplerdotcom True
@rapplerdotcom True.
@mariaressa @rapplerdotcom Correct.
@cnnphilippines How about Pulong and his collaborators of Shabu, aren't they more a "terrorist" than NPA? NPAs don't destroy future generations not like Pulong's shabu who destroys every Filipino's future. NPA is lesser evil than PULONG DUTERTE.
@DZMMTeleRadyo Mindanao has suffered so much because of Duterte's Martial Law. The Mindanaoans are regretting voting for Duterte. He shamed the Mindanaoans.
@altBBMemployee @edythe9 Wouldn't that be possible?
@Legally_K It's not passing the bar that defines a lawyer but how he/she implements the laws in accordance with real justice and in concordance with laws of the Almighty. The Dutertes failed on this aspect.
@Change_Scamming Dutertards are in big trouble in the United Kingdom meaning the hands of justice is now at last rolling and soon Duterte will be caught up with his crimes.
@raissawriter Cool
@gmanews Umali and his band of arrogant morons trying to destroy Phl justice system so that murders, corruption, lies etc will prevail in the government system. Umali should resign and so with his collaborators.
@AmyMek That's expected! But telling the truth and nothing but the truth is an unsurmountable weapon against liars.

@SilentNoMorePH Lol
@SyLicoNgaAko Lol
@News5AKSYON Really? Or isn't it the other way around?
@KaJuror @inquirerdotnet It's not insult what PM Trudeau said. It is reprimanding Duterte what he did to Fil ppl was wrong. Mass murder is an intl crime &amp; Duterte's liable.
@iMthinkingPinoy @PabloLayson Fake news???
@SilentNoMorePH Yes bcoz a leader who respects human existence like PM Trudeau would really be concerned.
@gmanews Govt should exact payment for her disability.

@IpeLustre Not all leaders are morons. The intellectual leaders knew Duterte committed crime against Filipino ppl by mass murder.
@NCorralesINQ @Team_Inquirer @inquirerdotnet Talk is cheap show us.

@InqMetro FREE SENATOR LEILA DE LIMA.
@SenLeiladeLima @BalAnjongPong Denying the visit to De Lima by dignitaries means this administration is afraid and guilty of illegal detention and expose of real scenario in Phl.
@rapplerdotcom Leaders of countries point at North Korea on use of chemical weapons yet US, their great ally is using such. Leaders better be consistent with what they say.
@FilY0 @BalAnjongPong @DanSantos8 @braniacthoughts @yusufledesma @JenrosSato @LivesMatterPH @D0D0NNA @nwlgrcia @PunchTheLies Terrorism is not owing to Islam religion. There's extremism among the Muslims because of oppressive governments and who make agreements with Muslims but lie.

@FilY0 @Chip2chip2 @DanSantos8 @PunchTheLies @Gabgrielle @jo2velasquez @_QuePasaChica_ @D0D0NNA @RenHu2 @braniacthoughts @JenrosSato Every Filipino should support SC Chief Sereno's investigation of P6.4 /28.9 billion shabu smuggling that involved Paolo Duterte.

@rapplerdotcom I remember my grandpa"s saying: "Apo ingatan mo pangalan mo kasi tayong mahihirap ang tanging kayamanan natin sa mundo ay pangalan natin."
@rapplerdotcom Yan ang kinaiinggitan ni Duterte. Internstional recognition. Siniraan na niyang lahat si Sen pero mabango pa rin pangalan ni Sen De Lima.

@GrizzleMaximus @NIVIsa4031 Well, this statement suited Duterte, President of d Philippines whose son is involved in shabu trafficking but still has guts to look clean.
@rrrabidcat It was whitewashed by this administration to protect expose of Paolo Duterte's involvement.
@BoomBuencamino @yusufledesma Really. LOL
@lahingpnoy I totally disagree w/ Chiz. There are many factors that can b seen now why we can say Duterte is a dictator and a tyrant, &amp; a murderer too.
@HecklerForever @leahnavarro LOL.
@Arab_News Why is it that only now do they come out in the open and expose the crime? the victims should have filed a complaint right after d incident.
@saladinMY Subhanallah.
@PhilippineStar Kapal naman mukha nitong Presidente na ito para magsabi nito sa mga bata eh mismo anak nya si Paolo involved sa pagbebenta ng drugs.
@PhilstarNews That's true. He tries to blame LP for his drug ills. Duterte cannot even clear out Paolo's involvement in P6.4billion shabu released in dvo.
@leahnavarro @SenLeiladeLima Yes. She has been illegally detained for many months already. She is avictim of Duterte's fake news modus operandi. FREE DE LIMA.

@inquirerdotnet @NCorralesINQ Atik yan.
@limbertqc @MaamSyj Correct. Pakulo lang ni Duterte yan para madeklara nya ang Martial Law sa buong Pilipinas. Gusto kasi maging diktador tulad ni Marcos.

@philippinesusa @del_lorenzana @DFAPHL @PTVph @gmanews @rapplerdotcom @inquirerdotnet @PIADesk If my dad was alive, he would be one of these ppl standing here.
@lahingpnoy @RenHu2 Thats true. Time wl come when the lambs fights back against this tyrant leader. And it will be fir good.
@IslamicTwee7s @yusufledesma Ameen.
@gregrf11 This admin shoulb be ashamed lambasting Edsa Ppls Power. They wouldnt be enjoying the fruits of d ppls power if not for d filipinos.
@gregrf11 This admin doesnt know how to respect Edsa. Its not d yellow who revolted. It is the Filipino masses who joined hands to ouster a dictator.
@yusufledesma Nope. He is really threatening. He is actually manufacturing a most dangerous biochem product which could kill millions in just seconds.
@ABSCBNNews So arrogant this tyrant. He thinks he own Philippines. Ang kapal ng mukha 10 inches thick. Makakita ka rin ng katapat.
@bethangsioco Yes

@teddyboylocsin You didnt count yet those sober in urban areas wholl become active anytime. Duterte broke many hearts in demolition of Marawi &amp; theyre angry
@teddyboylocsin Thats US military strategy against Vietnam but it failed. US brought home thousands of body bags everyday.
@yusufledesma Well, he is not joking brod, for sure.
@MarionA56n Oo nga. Lol. Ganyan si satanas iba iba ang hitsura.
@VicoSotto Well, Tito Sooto is on the side if these people, why complain? We thought e is much better than these murderer and tyrant Duterte.
@mariaressa @rapplerdotcom Cayetano is the son of the most principled man but he's dishonoring his father's name by collaborating with a murderer and a tyrant.
@News5AKSYON Yan kasi trabaho ng taong ito kaya yan ang bukambibig nya.
@gmanews This immoral should be kicked out of govt. We taxpayers dont want to waste money on a deranged person like Andanar, Mocha, etc.
@iMthinkingPinoy Despite Duterte and supporters backbiting of VP she managed to accomplish many things. That is a good leader unmindful of bad ppl like PRRD.
@MaamSyj Nope.
@ogie_rosa Na praning na mga tao ni tyrant lahat ibinibintang kay VP.
@Impeach_D_Trump @The_UnSilent_ @realDonaldTrump Correct.

@inquirerdotnet @jovicyeeINQ Lol. Its bcoz internet providers slows it down to have bigger profit. And they love cheatingsubscribers.
@inquirerdotnet @NCorralesINQ Why is this immoral Andanar allowed to hold office in the govt? He should be fed to the dogs where he belong. Wasting taxpayetd money.

@Chip2chip2 @yusufledesma @Templar__ @braniacthoughts @JenrosSato @RenHu2 @JonJon_G8 @Gabgrielle @D0D0NNA @DanSantos8 @KenCallawood Lol
@gmanews The other woman? Not the wife?
@KowboySantos @MaamSyj @rapplerdotcom Thats extortion in daylight. Who do you think ordered this? Ur guess is as good as mine.
@IpeLustre @MaamSyj Tama
@nowthisnews @MaamSyj Women chastity in the world reallywent down on the drain.
@Simply_Clinton @yusufledesma Lol
@gmanews Kamag anak seguro ito ng mga DDS.
@AJEnglish That means outrage or anger.
@MaamSyj Nakakahiya Presidente ng Pilipinas mahilig pa rin sa i - - t eh ang tanda tanda na. Baka pati poste kung mukhang babae patusin din. Yaaks.
@MaamSyj Well perversion is an abomination to Allah and all these wl have a painful retribution from Allah.
@yusufledesma Nevertheless, one day Duterte will be caught up with his too many crimes. He can escape manmade laws but not the punishment of Allah (swt).
@yusufledesma Yes. Duterte had been doing business with Chinese triad over d years. Thats where Paolo learned d Triad power &amp; followed father's footsteps.
@IllegalEnglish Lol
@inquirerdotnet Nope and you know that being the NEDA chief during FVRs presidency. Your admin was the best so with FVR.
@glnnlopez Ha ha ha
@MaamSyj Whoa she said it right.
@Athens1865 @gmanews Dapat Duterte RESIGN. Baka maubos ang Pinas kabebenta nya sa mga hapon at tsino.
@Dutertenomics @VMI9926 @gmanews Really? Eh kayo ng boss nyo ang gumagawa nyan hindi siSen Trillanes.
@gmanews Lol.
@OcaBacs @MaamSyj @gmanews Yan ang mga asong ulol ni Duterte pati buntis di pinatawad.
@MrFrankBaraan @DanSantos8 Oh yes ur right.
@cnnphilippines Naku bakit charges lang. Dapat barilin din yan gaya ng mga EJK victims. Masahol pa sa drugs ang kaso nyan. Dakilang magnanakaw.
@echo_realnat @MaamSyj Yes.
@fthilbay Join hands and fight the tyrant.
@yusufledesma Ooh lah lah. Gina was not confirm bcoz Duterte all along wants to pursue open mining with the big mining companies. Malaki kasi kikitain nya
@SyLicoNgaAko Correct. Inherited from their boss.
@XHNews Extremism on governance should also be addressed. Duterte is terrorizing this nation with this.
@EmilioDJacinto @1abuazzam All propaganda groups. We cant be fooled by those anymore. The real skin if Dutertes are exposed. Even heavy mascara can make it up.
@rapplerdotcom @1abuazzam Maybe those came from Paolo Duterte. Investigation is just a show to make it look they're working. That's a burnt out style of PDEA.
@merilla2010 @News5AKSYON @ShylaFrancisco Excuse me the government are the ppl. The ppl  who were trusted by d govt to manage them are the killers bcoz they use their power to do so.
@konisgrateful @News5AKSYON @ShylaFrancisco Yes they are. You look more like an NPA than them.
@News5AKSYON @ShylaFrancisco Duterte is a genocidal maniac murderer of the Filipino people.
@News5AKSYON @ShylaFrancisco See. Duterte is really a murderer. He should be charged in the International Court for genocide  of poor Filipino people.
@lahingpnoy Lol
@inquirerdotnet What is this group? In preparation for Sara's presidential candudacy. Why so small?
@m_vtec23 @MadamClaudiaAko Ikaw makitid ang utak palibhasa yong utak mo nilagay mo sa puwitan.
@m_vtec23 @MadamClaudiaAko At kung may bayag ka bakit di ka nag front line makipaglaban sa mga terrorista? Hanggang salita ka lang gya ng amo mong mamatay tao.
@m_vtec23 @MadamClaudiaAko Naku ha. Alam mo ba kung sino ang totoog terrorist? Kung magsalita ka parang me alam ka. Nasa tyan k pa ng nanay mo tinerorize kmi ni Marcos
@yusufledesma Yes. Thats good so that more rebel leaders will rise up to fight tyranny &amp; dictatorship.
@lahingpnoy Mabuti di nasunog si Duterte pagbisita. Eh di ba ang satanas nasusunog pag makakita ng krusipiho.
@BoomBuencamino @MarionA56n @PinoyAkoBlog Lol.
@rapplerdotcom Ouch. I will NEVER VOTE 4 her.
@gmanews Kalokohan yan kadi may interes pa rin. Sino kaya makikinabang dito sa bangko na ito?
@m_vtec23 @MadamClaudiaAko Naku ha aksyon agad ang pumatay ng tao palibhada kampon ni satanas. Buti pa ang panot di naman mamatay tao gaya nyo.
@R4GEtoilet @MadamClaudiaAko LP lang bukambibig mo eh sino ba ang walang awang pumapatay ng tao di ba amo nyong si Duterte.
@MadamClaudiaAko Tumpak ka dyan.
@ANCALERTS Calling EU  and international org. to help EJK victims in Philippines in fighting for justice. They had no one to turn to here in Phl.
@angmarino69 You are correct.
@News5AKSYON There is a hidden agenda between Duterte and Bautista on this resignation. Guess what?
@ANCALERTS Really? Well let us see what happens.
RT @BlackHawk20171: How deep is the support for Duterte? https://t.co/7lL3NmpgXr via @manilabulletin Please read this opinion. This is the…
How deep is the support for Duterte? https://t.co/7lL3NmpgXr via @manilabulletin Please read this opinion. This is the real scenario.
@TrillanesSonny A traitor is someone who is in power and orders killing of the ppl who pay his salary. A dictator has risen in Phl. This must be stop.
@News5AKSYON Mayor we need help from international area. There is a state-sponsored  killing of Filipino pplgoing on. The world should know and help fil.
@iamdencioperez @gmanews How about your boss? He got only 6 years term if he  dont die. But if your boss dies, we will go after you and all your collabirators.
@iamdencioperez @gmanews Yes he had. His biggedt accomplishment is exposing Duterte's wealth and advocating for truth on DDS murders and killings.
@gmanews Trillanes is correct. The Duterte DDS are traitors and murderers. They kill ppl without mercy.
@BetterWorld_TS @MerdKurd @AFP Yes correct.
@BetterWorld_TS @AFP How shameful for Tillerson to say this. Better he orders all Americans get out from Middle East countries because it is not their forte.
@AFP Who is Tillerson to order Iran militias? He is not even an official of Iran. Gosh, he should put his actions in place. Not applicable.
@VP There should be an audit of companies who earn lots but evade taxes and dont pay right employees. One example is Genesis Rehab Centers, etc.
@SilentNoMorePH Lol
@ogie_rosa What comes out from d mouth is what d heart contains. If words coming out from a person is immoral, it means whole body &amp; heart's filthy.
@rapplerdotcom Am one of the benefciaries of this program. It helps a lot for students who can't afford to go to expensive private schools.
@paramour27 Flocks with the same feathers flock together. They fire ppl they don;t want. But, look at Paolo Duterte involved in Shabu, nothing done.
@CNN My, my, my.
@srsasot What a laugh! Haven't you heard arms made by Filipinos in Danao Cebu? They can do replica of any kind of guns. However, govt dont support.
@yusufledesma Yes.
@yusufledesma Thats baloney. Duterte's words has no gusrantee at all except  if he say it with black and white. He lies to his teeth so how can we trust.
@SyLicoNgaAko Yes The abrupt phase out will place in jeopardy the commuters.
@mariaressa @yusufledesma @rapplerdotcom Duterte and PNP should read more RA 10630 Strengthening the Juvenile Justice System in Phl. Because, violation of this law is punishable.
@mariaressa @yusufledesma @rapplerdotcom Maybe because he's not privy to d amendment or trying to get blind of it?
@manilabulletin Yes. Terrorism by Duterte's DDS.
@gmanews Thats good. Sen Trillanes shoulf expose to the world the state-sponsored killings of young students and others here in the Philippines.
@mariaressa @rapplerdotcom That will be more lower if Duterte don't step down.
@AJEnglish Thats because of drugs and most of all, shaytan is living in their hearts not The Almighty.
@MaamSyj Really? He forgot his son Paolo is d msin source of shabu and Paolo's partners, the chinese, distributes shabu among the rich in forbes.
@bracciano1984 @AJEnglish Libya became a great nation because of Ghadaffy's leadership. Now, Libya's leader brought the nation to its lowly low.
@AJEnglish Ghadaffi gave freedom to Libyans. Now Libyans are under an American puppet leader where fate of Libya's dictated by US.
@BirdHasSpoken @Jimparedes Duterte rejected the funds because he thought all along, he'll b d holder of that fund. But EU doesnt work that way. EU manages their fund.
@rainehayden @Jimparedes I thought Duterte knew where it is. Why is Duterte not running after those who squandered Yolanda funds?
@Jimparedes @DanSantos8 Thats expected. EU dont easily forget immoral tirades esp. from a president.
@manilabulletin @argyllcyrus_MB @GenKabiling Padilla is wrong. It had gotten stronger and wider. They reached Philippines. Further, sympathy for them getting higher espfrom US.
@mariaressa Yes.
@MaamSyj All the Phil. Govt institutions are rotten esp d Pres. Both Exec &amp; Leg. Should be abolished and a ppl's govt and court must be established.
@WeAreUnitedDDS @yusufledesma None of the above. Power is only owed for Allah (swt).
@ANCALERTS @IanEsguerra @LexiSchulze The only government acceptable to the Bangsamoro Muslims is a govt under the tenets of Islam. Not a kufr initiated government.
@ANCALERTS @IanEsguerra @LexiSchulze Correction, Bangsamoro is separate and distinct from the Filipino nation. Trace back history Alamia. How come you dont tell the truth.
@ANCALERTS @IanEsguerra @LexiSchulze ARMM is poor because funds coming in from foreign donors is siphoned by the national governmentto other regions and their pockets.
@ANCALERTS @IanEsguerra @LexiSchulze BBL is not the answer to d bangsamoro problem. Only INDEPENDENCE as espoused by MILF Chairman Amirul Mujahideen; Sheikh Hashim Salamat.
@ANCALERTS @IanEsguerra @LexiSchulze ARMM is just an instrument of corruption by the national government. Hataman is tolerating them why he stayed in power until now.
@ABSCBNNews @DZMMTeleRadyo @mikenavallo "My taxes"? Does he mean Duterte now owns our taxes? Too thick-faced to claim Filipinos taxes his own.
@PunchTheLies @DanSantos8 @alanpcayetano @MrFrankBaraan @mila_d_aguilar @Chip2chip2 @jerichorayel @_QuePasaChica_ @KatarHol5 @RenHu2 @LivesMatterPH @wondergirlash @bennyccabanit They dont accept EU funds because they cannot juggle EU funds to their own delight. EU is strict with audit and transparency.
@ANCALERTS Correct.
@wondergirlash We are from Davao too and we were there even before Duterte arrived Davao.  We knew him better than any younger supporters of this tyrant.
@MadamClaudiaAko @RenHu2 Lol. Correction please, "change is wanning". Gone with the wind. Twas blown apart by Duterte's fart.
@ogie_rosa Lol. They knew theyre losing their battle against VP thats why their now hitting below d belt. But VP is a dignified person so she dont mind
@ogie_rosa Lol. Maybe they are too morons to think of other alibis.
@VOANews People had spoken..INDEPENDENCE!
@DailySabah Declare Independence NOW.
@AJENews Declare Independence NOW.
@PhilippineStar Big NO!
@MarionA56n Well, the first one to benefit is Duterte, of course.
@Istrayber See his color coming out. Thats why for years politicians of Mindanao didnt have a chance in the heirarchy bcoz they lack good leadership.
@leo34009283 @gargano_magdalo @ilda_talk You are the ones destroying this country.  We should never have voted for him, he lies to his teeth.
@iMthinkingPinoy That is stalking. And there is a crime for this.
@argyllcyrus_MB @manilabulletin Then why is Pulong got scot free? Inconsistent statements. Fooling us Filipinos.
@leo34009283 @gargano_magdalo @ilda_talk Freeing or ENSLAVING the Filipinos? Wake up!
@AungNai00141921 @KenRoth @matthewfsmith Subhanallah.
@KenRoth Nobody's helping them because they're Muslims.
@iMthinkingPinoy Me too.
@leo34009283 @gargano_magdalo @ilda_talk Realy. The VP is performing than Duterte. It is because she prefer doing her job well rather than do character demolition like you &amp; ur boss
@gideonlasco He do not care because he actually planned this so he gets more profit.
@ceejong @yusufledesma Crazy suggestion. Do you think the repercussions of this suggestion would be easy to handle? Duterte will just be asking for a boomerang.
@theamateurear @yusufledesma @gmanews Agreeing depends on what issue. We knew better.
@squarerootofpai @mosesalbiento Yes you are right.
@kristinamisajon @ronbotvidal @thegrandpianist @mosesalbiento Yes correct. Dugyot ngarud.
@kristinamisajon @ronbotvidal @thegrandpianist @mosesalbiento Yes correct.
@ronbotvidal @mosesalbiento Duterte is a tyrant and we will never believe in what you are saying. You want phase out bcoz there is big money for Duterte and you.
@rtarellano @squarerootofpai @benign0 @mosesalbiento @MillennialOfMNL I dont think so. Will Duterte feed the drivers when they go jobless?
@xcyting1 @mosesalbiento @Seb_Castro Jeepney drivers are not disobeying laws. They want to be heard. This admin is disobeying d law by trampling on d rights of drivers.
@chicken4everMD @mosesalbiento Wrong. His words are do easy to understand.
@mosesalbiento Finally, Duterte's real skin is exposed.
@theamateurear @yusufledesma @gmanews With a dictator in power, laws gor the indigenous and Muslims is null and void just like what happened in 70s. All lands of Muslims gone.
@BlueSea1964 @NIVIsa4031 Its because Muslims do not commit suicide. There might be a foul play on his death but definitely not suicide.
@24OrasGMA I doubt this allegation. In Angeles city, PNPs are extorting money from Koreans &amp; other foreigners. And if they dont give, they charge them.
@cnnphilippines TRUE.
@gmanews AFP will not allow residents to come back to Marawi because the AFP and their families is planning to grab the land of the Maranaws.
@KenRoth For what purpose would that visit be? To celebrate Duterte's state-sponsored murder of young Filipinos? Or conforme of his dictstorship?
@MarionA56n That is a lie. If Duterte is concerned of students, why did Kian died and the others? It is hard for us to trust Duterte's words anymore.
@gmanews Any fund that will be used to build our mosques must come from halal sources. If Duterte wl use hoarded money, that is haram.
@gmanews The Muslims of Marawi treasures their past structures i.e. mosques, madrasahs, etc bcoz the fund used to build these are from halal sources.
@gmanews The Maranaws dont need those equipment. What they need is justice for what Duterte &amp; AFP did to the ppl of Marawi.
@PinoyAkoBlog @yusufledesma Just laugh at it and say nothing. The blessings of these ppl is confiscated by Allah &amp; added unto you. Have patience 4 d reward is paradise.
@juanelyas @PinoyAkoBlog PinoyAkoBlog is a courageous person. Every Filipino who loves  justice and freedom  should follow her footsteps.
@gmanews Show proof!
@acbernales @gmanews Oh why would he stop the probe? If you chose being a public official, your bank account should be an open book if you're not hoarding money.
@gmanews Good news .
@amsvillena @gmanews We are also are affected but our sacrifice is our contribution and support for their outcry. It is justice theyre fighting for so we rally.
@MaamSyj Lol
@MaamSyj @SPAMelaHam Lol.
@AsecMargauxUson I hope Esperon will not be the first Ilocano general who will put to shame his tribe by siding with an evil tyrant and dictator.
@AsecMargauxUson Yes that's true. Sara knows because her family are the one espousing "destabilization and terrorism."
@gmanews Yes it will not but drivers and operators will be  burden debt forever. Dont fool us, we knew ur evil plans.
@joelrayala @gmanews Yes time for more SOPs of this administration in cahoots with suppliers at the expense of jeepney drivers.
@amsvillena @gmanews You are the one who should see what evil plans this administration had for the jeepney drivers.
@gorgeouslynne @gmanews You seem not to understand their issues and concerns why u dont emphatize. Read more so u will learn the hardship they experienced.
@gmanews Yes that's true.
@marstian @Jimparedes We don't need tattoo of Pulong. The firdt time statement of d witness is more than enough evidence Pulong is involved in the shabu shipment.
@akosimelvinmagz @Jimparedes A bank waiver wiil pave the way to open up bank accounts in all banks worldwide not only AMLA. Which do you prefer, AMLA only or BANK WAIVER
@Jimparedes Well, why would signing a bank waiver takes too long? It might be the hoarded money is too huge to transfer immediately????
@gmanews Duterte orders phaseout coz it would give him bigger SOP to d one who will supplies new PUVs to replace phased out jeepneys.
@PhilippineStar @mjaysoncayabyab Go go go we rally behind.
@xpeanutgalleryx Destabilization does not exist. Filipinos r desperate 4 justice that's why they     start getting out on the street. World pls hear d outcry
@LivesMatterPH @PinoyAkoBlog @FilY0 @ogie_rosa @MadamClaudiaAko @PunchTheLies @KatarHol5 @RebPadreDamaso @OcaBacs @MarionA56n @SilentNoMorePH Lol. Many courses she says she learned all placed in her butt bcoz Sassot never learned good manners and right conduct just like her boss.
@srsasot You should be the one incarcerated for spreading lies against honest Filipinos.
@lahingpnoy @PresidentialCom Duterte is lying. He went to Marawi to see if he was successful in destroying the Mosques. May Duterte and his whole family be CURSED.
@tontoncontreras Bautista trying to run awsy from the ghost he created, retribution, and a painful one. He can't evade punishment esp. from God The Almighty.
@tatancast @MaamSyj When Filipino poor masses starts outcry on d streets, it means this administration's inutile &amp; ppl are at verge of desperation for justice.

He brought chaos to the Filipino people. FREE PHILIPPINES FROM DUTERTE.
@Pulitika2010 @leahnavarro So truth is out. Honestly, those who destabilize this nation are the Duterte supporters and politicians in cahoots with his evil ways.
قصفت القوات المسلحة الفلبينية مدينة المراوي مما أسفر عن مقتل أطفالنا دون رحمة وإلقاء اللوم على موت عندما كانوا الجناة.
دمرت مساجدنا في مدينة مراوي في حين غادرت كنيسة الكفر. سبحان لله.
والسماح لوكالة فرانس برس باغتصاب النساء المسلمات. قد يكون لعن لهذا. سوبهانالا.
@JegoRagragio Oh that is "military junta". Remember who was the other tyrant who did this?
@inquirerdotnet Really! I dont think so.
@SkyNews Those are laws ordained by Allah (swt). Muslims must follow no matter what manmade laws orders.
@ogie_rosa Everyone is entitled to their opinion. It is exercising our freedom of speech. As long as constructive criticism, not below the belt.
@AJEnglish Why is that so?
RT @leahnavarro: So, no use for body cams on PNP. Tokhang continues:		WATCH: Cops turn CCTV camera away from drug ops that killed 3 https:/…
@leahnavarro That is clear evidence PNP are doing illegals. Filipinos wake up. Let us join together and fight these dogs of Duterte.
@leo34009283 @ilda_talk I dont think so. He is not a good leader. He is immoral and a tyrant not fit to for presidency. We regret voting for him.
@deandraker @ogie_rosa Lol
@ogie_rosa Lol
@iMthinkingPinoy This arms should be distributed to poor civilians so that they can protect and defend themselves from PNP/AFP terrorists.
@gmanews Really? Those are your DDS riding in tandem.Does it mean you're now prepared to exterminate ur comrades?
@gmanews That is state-sponsored murder of Filipinos by Duterte. Duterte should be brought to international court for this genocide.
@FilY0 @MarionA56n I told you so. Whitewashed. Gordon ka pa. Linta yan.
@lahingpnoy Thats the trend now. Son of a tyrant kasi.
@mitchellvii Lol
@gmanews Resigning to save face. Wife's expose is really true. Sad to note he go scot free bcoz of congress whitewash of his crime.

True.
@AJENews  https://t.co/npHJawjTPB
@AJENews  https://t.co/s0SWwN5z5A
@AJENews Yes.
@KenRoth Subhanallah.
@AJEnglish Why is there no help coming in for the Rohingyas? Where is the Muslim Ummah who has the responsibility to protect the Muslim people?
@AJEnglish Only if there is a sincere reconciliation.
@AJEnglish The cuts must be made on purchase of armaments but not on health. It is a basic need of people.
@AJEnglish True, "NO HUMAN IS ILLEGAL". We were all created by Allah (swt) as inhabitants of this Dunya. No amount of man-made laws can stop this.
@AJENews Independence must not be dilly-dallied. The people registered their outcry by voting YES. Therefore, give what the people want....FREEDOM.
@AJENews On what agenda?
@AJEnglish @AJUpFront I don't think so.
@AJEnglish @MariaBelen_Fdez A revolutionary, of course.

@ilda_talk Really! I beg to disagree. She's a sheep compared to Duterte, who is lion. And a lion devours the weak. Not safe to have a lion in power.
@thehill Putin's very much correct in his statement.
@SA_1953 @thehill Of course he doesn't care. He only caresfor himself. He shouldnt have been a President if he do not care about people's opinion.
@thehill Surveys don't lie. It means Trump is not performing and citizens are disappointed
@PunchTheLies @MrFrankBaraan @RenHu2 @_QuePasaChica_ @mila_d_aguilar @ACraigBennett @SyLicoNgaAko @BoomBuencamino @bennyccabanit @BongPhillips555 @IpeLustre Expect a whitewash if Gordon does the investigation. He is also one of the lapdogs of Duterte.
@SyLicoNgaAko Yes that is true. That's why davao ct diversion is sinking also to manifest disgust.
@washingtonpost That is violation of religious rights of Muslims.
@RebPadreDamaso @DanSantos8 Lol.
@wondergirlash @DanSantos8 @EmilioDJacinto @KatarHol5 @KenCallawood @RenHu2 @Chip2chip2 @FilY0 @RebPadreDamaso @donthebasher @GisingPilipino Yes, thats true.
@DanSantos8 @EmilioDJacinto @wondergirlash @KatarHol5 @KenCallawood @RenHu2 @Chip2chip2 @FilY0 @RebPadreDamaso @donthebasher @GisingPilipino There is none. Those promises are just cake icings of an evil agenda, to destroy the good standing of Phil in the eyes of the world.
@EmilioDJacinto @wondergirlash @KatarHol5 @KenCallawood @DanSantos8 @RenHu2 @Chip2chip2 @FilY0 @RebPadreDamaso @donthebasher @GisingPilipino Lol. And they accuse Pres. Aquino did nothing when in fact he has moreaccomplishments than Duterte.
@__yyyyyyyyyyy__ @persidaacosta Thats d craziest statement i have ever heard coming from a lawyer. Gosh it seems Duterte's craziness extended to his cabinets like Acosta.
@thehill Nope. The first lady is still Hillary Clinton. Why? Because she help lots of ppl since time immemorial. Ivanka did nothing to help citizens.
@thehill What defeat? ISIS now brought their war in US states because Trump do not know how to fine tune his words and is so arrogant in words.
@yusufledesma @rapplerdotcom Yes, political terrorists like Duterte.
@gmanews That's 1 way of saying he agrees with Mocha's character demolition of ppl. Tolerating evil ways of Mocha. Shame on you.
@gmanews Yes, indeed. We also supported hi in the campaign bcoz it was my uncle who convinced him to run. But it turned out he's not worth it.

@thehill Never use "I" when you're a leader of a country. It is "we" who made you one.
@dzbb @wengsalvacion See. Duterte will bury the Filipino people in too much debt.

@DZMMTeleRadyo @dzmmPatrol44 How about  PNP who killed innocent children, will there be a komite for them, too?
@KixOTrece @JGimoro @ilovetonita20 @Fitch1124 @Dutertenomics @lasertard @srsasot @ChavariaRolly @Edison79127512 @solis_tom @sipsipbloom Oh really. Fool yourself not us Muslims. You kufr thats why you dont know truth. And you are a shayran thats y u have a filthy mouth.
@joym_speaks @DanSantos8 Yes. A principled man.
@ogie_rosa @MarionA56n Lol.
@yusufledesma A good cover up.
@DarwinAwardsPH @BalAnjongPong Yes. Since they boast their talent in research, kindly research the wealth of Duterte and children plus the other woman.

@JGimoro @ilovetonita20 @KixOTrece @Fitch1124 @Dutertenomics @lasertard @srsasot @ChavariaRolly @Edison79127512 @solis_tom @sipsipbloom And how dare you criticize a President. You're nothing compared to his accomplishments. You, what have uaccomplished?
@JGimoro @ilovetonita20 @KixOTrece @Fitch1124 @Dutertenomics @lasertard @srsasot @ChavariaRolly @Edison79127512 @solis_tom @sipsipbloom It is otherwise, napaloko kayo kay Duterte. Aquino might be bad to you but for us he's good coz he never demolished our mosques &amp; community.
@USATODAY I dont think so. Kim by the look of his accomplishments is not affected by any tweets or threats of US and allies. He is a strong leader.
For us Muslims, it was FVR who did an outstanding leadership. Instead of destroying muslim communities, he united us as one and help us thru
@pavelvond @Forum_2000 @mlq3 @yusufledesma @maritesdvitug @mariaressa Yes. Gone are the days when FVR made Phl an economic tiger bcoz of his good leadership. Now, the leader is big liar &amp; disgraced Phl n world.
@xcyting1 @gmanews Really? I guess it would be the one who signs it will be the first example of fake news.
@SingForMoi @gmanews @bamaquino @kikopangilinan Mauna si Duterte followed by his rank and file. Sya yong unang nagbitaw ng fake news. Thegreat lying tyrant president.
@gmanews @DanSantos8 Yes like Mocha Uson. Theyre tongue should be cut so that they cant spread fake news again including AFP spokesman.
@News5AKSYON Honestly, we nevrr believe what AFP is saying. It is all lies what they're saying. We knew better and we know d truth on Marawi demolition.
@bennyccabanit That is expected. Those who are poor r d ones put behind bars. But the son and his group go scot-free. It' bcoz father is also in cahoots.

@crofin67 Why is this violence and oppression tolerated? Are there no existing protectors of these people anymore?
@thehill Funny, they missed d most important program for children. Are we having mindless congress now? Gone are the days when Congress really cares.
@TheDemocrats Yes. It is unethical doing tweets and backbiting his fellow politicians. He should be a President for all Americans not for chosen few.
@PunchTheLies @DanSantos8 @risahontiveros @TrillanesSonny @jvejercito @WinGatchalian74 @TeddyBaguilatJr @_QuePasaChica_ @MrFrankBaraan @mila_d_aguilar @RebPadreDamaso Well it seems Duterte will bankrupt Philippines with his crazy ideas. Too much suffering for the Filipino people.
@gmanews Of course he will not cooperate because he doesn't want the truth to come out in the open that he is hoarding billions of people's money.
@prodigalfan Really! I think it is the other way around. Who's doing the arrogance of killing Filipinos especially teenagers without due process of law?
@ogie_rosa LOL!
Investigate money laundering of Duterte and Family. Trillanes was right about Duterte's Billions. How did Duterte accumulated such wealth?
https://t.co/g9DM5IGGov. Who says Duterte is POOR &amp; NOT CORRUPT? Call AMLA.

@YellowPadawan This administration really got a "YELLOW FREAK". They're so angry with LPs. It just mean LPs has good deeds that Dutertes are jealous of.
@PinoyAkoBlog In Duterte's administration, CORRUPTION is under the table, over the table, and INCLUDING THE TABLE.
@atDavidHoffman All of them!
@PhilippineStar OMG. He's crazy. Following the footsteps of Marcos. Wants his whole family to become President. What a shame.
@FilY0 @wondergirlash @jo2velasquez @teta_limcangco @RebPadreDamaso @Chip2chip2 @donthebasher @JonJon_G8 @D0D0NNA @DanSantos8 @braniacthoughts Duterte and his supporters thought they can suppress Filipinos to fight FREEDOM ALL OVER AGAIN. Mr President, DON'T PUSH US TO THE WALL!
@ogie_rosa LOL
@lcmlaw_ph That is only propaganda of Duterte. TALK IS CHEAP. SHOW US!
@SuperficialGZT CORRECT.
@zenszei Even the religious sect goes out on d streets if a tyrant and a dictator exists. Look at the street children.What did PRRD do to help them?
@SuperficialGZT CORRECT. Mocha is creating Philippines as her own personal entertainment bar to Duterte's delight.
It turns out Sen. Trillanes is innocent of all Duterte's accusation against him. How come Filipinos voted for a President who's a BIG LIAR?
@Integrity_Plz @manilabulletin @GenKabiling It is the other way around, it was the AFP doing that. We knew all the facts. AFP news and you can't fool us.
@AbdulcaderAbbas @AJArabic @abuhilalah @Ahmadmuaffaq Yes. thousands martyred and homeless because of a tyrant who doesn't care about humanity.
@manilabulletin @MBvanneelaine Why is it that only Faeldon is charged on P6.4 billion shabu case. How about Paolo Duterte who's a collaborator? Justice has favoritism.
@manilabulletin @MB_mrtnsdngdng Ha ha ha that is how dirty PNP are.
@manilabulletin That is expected. Umali and the congressmen are all in cahoots with the KUMOLEK Chairman.
@manilabulletin Philippines ready to assist other nations but not ever ready to help the displaced Muslims in the Philippines.
@manilabulletin @GenKabiling Duterte is the number one terrorist. Because of him too many Muslims were displaced and homeless.
@manilabulletin @GenKabiling @argyllcyrus_MB Liar. You want a body camera so you will know who to kill anytime.
@manilabulletin @GenKabiling @argyllcyrus_MB Duterte wants P600 million to go to PNP so that he can siphoned it from there with the help of his PNP chief.
@manilabulletin @GenKabiling @argyllcyrus_MB Be warned. This might be a trap. DDS might kill any UN representative here in the Philippines.
@manilabulletin @argyllcyrus_MB @GenKabiling Actually, you ran for President to steal away again the freedom of the Filipino people to the Marcoses.
@manilabulletin @argyllcyrus_MB @GenKabiling That's why you are selling to the Marcoses again the freedom of the Filipinos. Shame on you.
@manilabulletin TALK IS CHEAP. SHOW US.
@manilabulletin @argyllcyrus_MB @GenKabiling How about your killing of Filipinos will there be a slowdown too? Guess, civilians should arm themselves so that we can defend ourselves.
@bungisngis6 @leahnavarro @MyRizalPH @donthebasher Yes, that is the creme of the top of Duterte Administration.
@ParengEnzo SeeQ! Slowly the DDS of Duterte is coming out. I told you. DUTERTE's DDS IS REAL. Civilians should start arming themselves against DDS.
@hrw Subhanallah.
@KenCallawood @Twitter @TwitterSupport @donthebasher @Chip2chip2 @DanSantos8 @RenHu2 @PunchTheLies @Gabgrielle @FilY0 @teta_limcangco @JonJon_G8 @KatarHol5 May Allah bring down punishment to this person. I wish a big earthquake will come and swallow his house.
@AbdulcaderAbbas Yes, I know.
Duterte may come clean in congress and senate on his creation of DDS in Davao City. But he can't hide from ALLAH. Everything is recorded.
For information of all Filipinos, the DDS of Duterte in Davao City is TRUE AND REAL. The witnesses were not believed bcoz they're poor ppl.
@gemprinsesa WEll say that Duterte. He was the one who placed Marcos in that cemetery.
@xpeanutgalleryx CORRECT!
@1trump2016fan7 @SpeakerRyan To hellfire!
@inquirerdotnet @LeilasINQ Duterte is tracing the money of Trillanes because he wants it to be added to his billions of money in offshore accounts. That's GREED.
@MariaESalinas @hrw That is America. Don't know what is "debt of gratitude/respect" just like the Philippine President now. Trump and Duterte are "2 of a kind."
@OPSpokesPH @PIADesk We doubt if CPP/NPA will ever agree on resumption of talks. This administration are full of LIES and INSINCERITY. So, what's the use?
@washingtonpost @abusulayman May ALLAH (swt) help the Muslims in Rohingya.
@cnnphilippines The one who point a finger has three fingers pointing back at him.
@PhilippineStar THE GREATEST FOLLOWER OF SHAYTAN IN THE PHILIPPINES.
@bobitiglao REALLY!!! WE DO NOT BELIEVE YOU.
@psychoticzombie Napoles issue was junked by this administration because they are also part of the scam. We knew better.
@renguillar @ilovetonita20 @LiberalPH To all Muslims let us remember when Duterte ordered destruction of Marawi City &amp; the rape and killing of innocent women by the AFP
@renguillar @ilovetonita20 @LiberalPH Dear Filipinos let us not forget that 6.7 Billion Shabu was released with the blessing of  Paolo Duterte to destroy our nation. Think!!!
@CeliaAsico @ilovetonita20 Oh my. I thought ur intelligent! LP is a political party. Only an individual can be termed A TYRANT and DUTERTE IS A TYRANT AND A DICTATOR.
@joalla117 @yusufledesma LOL
@nad0227 @yusufledesma CORRECT.
@Simply_Clinton No, ur not. Ur just acting like an HR victim. Bcoz if u are, then u will not vote P1000 budget for CHR. Shame on you Umali.
Mr. Gascon, don't mind Duterte accusing u a pedohpile because the one who accuses is the one who is a pedophile. How would he knew?
@rsurtida @CesarApolinario @chrgovph The crook cops is the job of the Ombudsman. CHR is protecting the basic rights of victims of injustice by men in uniform and tyrants.
@KBOMolina @yusufledesma He will never do that because he is also part of this category.
Today, if your speak out your right, Duterte calls you a leftist, an NPA, a terrorist, etc. This is his alibi to cover up his own crimes.
@jedqcepe @yusufledesma @gmanews That's true! However, this administration don't know that esp. the first family. They act as if they own Philippines &amp; everyone are slaves.
@gideonlasco Duterte thought Filipinos are afraid of Martial Law. He must not forget people can unite and topple down another tyrant the 2nd time around.
@roguehrepstaff Am just wondering how much drug money was paid to these congressmen to follow what Duterte wants for CHR?
@JGimoro @Fitch1124 @IrgsEver @TKasoy @Dutertenomics @lasertard @CeliaAsico @dutertardme @sipsipbloom @ilovetonita20 @RoamingSoul711 You have not read and understood clearly EO163A. Maybe you read it upside down with your head on your butt.
@EnigMa1307 @ilovetonita20 @cinzano_paris @AAA_Pro_DDS @GradeRuby Funny, the Duterte followers are much haunted by the LP's. It is because they are JEALOUS of what the LP has achieved while they have none.
@haydeenturner @prodigalfan @gmanews Who are you to tell Gascon resign? Maybe you're interested of his position so that you can stash away the CHR funds for Duterte. Ur crazy!
WORST PRESIDENT PHL EVER HAD IS DUTERTE. HE IS AN IMMORAL, A LIAR, A MURDERER, A TYRANT, A DICTATOR, ETC...TO D VICTIMS, PRAY HE BE CURSED.
@thehill That is the problem of a GOSSIP MONGERER PRESIDENT. He does not know how to mind his own business.
@ryale0530 @gmanews TALK IS CHEAP. SHOW ME DUTERTE IS REALLY CLEAN BECAUSE WE KNEW BETTER. YOU'RE STILL ON UR MOTHER'S WOMB, WE ALREADY KNEW DUTERTE, A BIG LIAR
@TheMovementPHL GO GO GO. WE RALLY BEHIND.
Why do you point on Trillanes? How about you? Why don't you tell the Filipinos how you accumulated your billions of wealth? Don't fool us.
How would we expect Duterte to intervene when HE IS THE AUTHOR OF THE P1000 CHR BUDGET. ALVAREZ &amp; UMALI ARE JUST THE SPOKESMAN OF DUTERTE.
THE CHR IS THE ONLY INSTITUTION VICTIMS CAN TURN TO WHEN ALL THESE ARROGANT POLITICIANS TURNS THEIR BACK TO JUSTICE.
@gmanews DILG EXEC IS A LIAR. CHITO GASCON &amp; CHR DID A LOT OF THINGS TO HELP POOR VICTIMS AND FAMILIES VICTIMIZED BY MEN IN UNIFORM. WE KNEW BETTER.
Few years back a lady was raped and killed by AFP in Callawa, Davao City. No DILG official investigated the crime, only CHR. We knew better.
@gmanews This administration is so desperate to destroy CHR because they don't want an institution who fights justice for the EJK victims.
@tessgarcia To Duterte supporters and family. Just pray hard Duterte will not die early because when he's gone, all of you will be hounded by his crime.
@jovenator @taga_sanpascual @gmanews Mind you, the best administration was Ramos administration. He is a General but he never order Filipinos killed. He made peace with all.
@jovenator @taga_sanpascual @gmanews How about the case of Paolo Duterte who was implicated in the 6.7 B shabu. Why is Duterte so slow in solving the case?
@jovenator @taga_sanpascual @gmanews You cannot convince us with your lies and propaganda. We knew better. Pity, you do not know the truth, what really is happening.
@jovenator @taga_sanpascual @gmanews Talk is cheap, show me! Many Muslim women raped and killed in Marawi city by AFP, why is it not in the news? Why is it not resolved? Liar.
@gmanews We will support this bill!

@teta_limcangco @wondergirlash @FilY0 @donthebasher @DanSantos8 @jo2velasquez @D0D0NNA @KenCallawood @JonJon_G8 @RenHu2 @Gabgrielle The Filipinos were betrayed by installing a dictator worst than Marcos.
@FilY0 @wondergirlash @donthebasher @teta_limcangco @DanSantos8 @jo2velasquez @D0D0NNA @KenCallawood @JonJon_G8 @RenHu2 @Gabgrielle FIGHT THE TYRANT.
@ryale0530 @prodigalfan @gmanews My only boss is Allah. You, your boss is Duterte, follower of Shaytan. Actually, ur d one paid to  do character demolition. Makarma ka sana.
@jovenator @taga_sanpascual @gmanews Their cases were sll suppressed by Duterte's collaborators. Don't you know that? Have you done something to bring justice to EJK victims?
@ryale0530 @gmanews How about Duterte? In just few months he spent billions in just few months? Pointing a finger to Aquino is 3 fingers pointing at you.
@DanSantos8 That is the face of dictator. He wants all good people out so he can do what he wants. As if he owns Philippines. Filipinos wake up.
@ryale0530 @gmanews Look who's talking. Maybe you do not know Duterte is more corrupt than the yellows and a murderer, too.
@inquirerdotnet @JLDejesusINQ It doesn't mean ur in government, u dont go against tyrants and butchers like Duterte. That is y CHR exists 4 checks and balance.
@Me_myself_Iryn @ABSCBNNews Correct.
@ABSCBNNews @yusufledesma That is the mark of Shaytan. May Allah bring down punishment to these people who suppress justice for victims of EJK.
@prodigalfan @gmanews Gascon is a good man compared to Duterte &amp; his PNP killer dogs. No need for him to be changed. He's a lone sheep against thousands of wolves
@taga_sanpascual @gmanews There is no need to change CHR leadership. They are outstanding in performing their jobs. Guess it's Congress that had to be abolished.
@gmanews That's a brilliant idea. We rally behind. Just send us details where to send our donation to CHR.
@chief0730 @gmanews This administration is committing more terroristic acts than Maute's. They kill people without mercy and they protect drug lords.
@chief0730 @gmanews Maute did not disrespect our Mosque. And we knew better than your pack of lies about Maute.
@coconut_block @gmanews You know the answer to that. LOL.
@jayfrancis32279 @gmanews Yes, i do agree with you, and so with her boss, Satan,s messenger in the Philippines.
@GeovaniAMartine @gmanews @JINGCASTANEDA Do you have proof on this? You only base this issue on AFP's lies. We knew better. The butchers &amp; rapists are not Maute's but AFP.
@sollaromtis @gmanews Birds with the same feathers flocked together.
@Jpyjcky @gmanews How about giving our taxes directly to CHR so that justice for victims of EJK is given. Our taxes are just wasted by PRRD killing people.
@ginoongreyes @gmanews Prosti's don't know ettiquettes. If they knew that, they safeguard their chastity first and foremost.
@gmanews Subhanallah. This lady disrespects our place of worship just like his boss. Curse on you.
@ogie_rosa Correct!
Terrorists to be humanely treated if they surrender, says Duterte. The real terrorist is Duterte and his PNP/AFP killer dogs.
@FilY0 @donthebasher @wondergirlash @JonJon_G8 @teta_limcangco @mila_d_aguilar @DanSantos8 @D0D0NNA @leahnavarro @PunchTheLies @jo2velasquez ....but he did not showed his back to prove there is no tattoo! I wonder why?

@FilY0 @wondergirlash @teta_limcangco @donthebasher @DanSantos8 @RenHu2 @jo2velasquez @Chip2chip2 @leahnavarro @mila_d_aguilar @PunchTheLies Sooner or later these tyrants will be caught up with their crimes against humanity. There will always be a final retribution for Dutertes.
@gmanews Marawi city mayor used to negotiate with Maute was just laughed out. Why? He is a Munafiq and a Murtad.
@PunchTheLies @TrillanesSonny @MrFrankBaraan @leahnavarro @DiNaProfMSSyj @mila_d_aguilar @_QuePasaChica_ @KatarHol5 @RenHu2 @DanSantos8 @xenohemlock @EmilioDJacinto Oh my. Why don't Duterte challenge Trillanes in a duel? Let us see who's the real champion. Trillanes has no DDS and not afraid of him.
@argyllcyrus_MB @manilabulletin Hos about Duterte's offshor acounts? Will he expose it also?
@LaBellaGlinda @inquirerdotnet The reds are not banking on the support of China. They actually rebel because the PHL government is too corrupt and oppressive of the poor.
@News5AKSYON I wonder why? Maybe Paolo's mind is muddled with 6.7 billion shabu!
@xzelrod31 @BalAnjongPong @gmanews CORRECT!
@leahnavarro UR RIGHT!
@manilabulletin @argyllcyrus_MB WHEY...WHO ARE YOU FOOLING, US? ONLY A MORON WILL BELIEVE CARL IS YOUR RELATIVE. U EVEN CLAIM UR A MARANAO BUT UR WAYS R AGAINST ISLAM.
@GaylaAnnTB PAOLO DUTERTE'S JUST MAKING FUN OF SENATE BECAUSE HE KNEW HE WILL WIN. WHY? BECAUSE THE ULTIMATE DRUG LORD IS PROTECTING HIM, U KNOW WHO!
@leahnavarro I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH YOU.
@inquirerdotnet Another propaganda statement but no sincerity attached to it. I hope the REDS won't fall into the trap.
@D0D0NNA Subhanallah.
@betseyklark Can we also send a letter to ICC registering our full support on the case against perpetrators of EJK Killings?
@KatarHol5 That's the reason why!
@_QuePasaChica_ SEE... ANOTHER WHITEWASH!
@IpeLustre YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!
@rapplerdotcom You are also guilty of this "pretended grief".
@FilY0 @DanSantos8 @wondergirlash @teta_limcangco @RenHu2 @jo2velasquez @D0D0NNA @leahnavarro @mila_d_aguilar @donthebasher @Gabgrielle The question is: How did PNP &amp; Duterte knew who are the narco politics and the dealers if those killed are not of their own people?
@D0D0NNA THESE EVIDENCES ARE JUST PLANTED TO JUSTIFY THE PNP MURDERS. WE DON;T BELIEVE ANYMORE THE PNP AND DUTERTE. THEY ARE ALL LIARS AND KILLERS.
@gmanews 100 % MALABO YAN MAIBALIK SA PINAS. EH NINAKAW NGA BAKIT PA ISASAULI? PROPAGANDA NA LANG YAN. WALANG KATOTOHANAN NA IBALIK.
@redwarriorryan @BalAnjongPong What a Moron Senator! Kian's body should have been brought in front of him before it was buried. Gordon might be blind or pretending blind.
@inquirerdotnet Good to hear they'll appear...hope it will not be a whitewash again. Nevertheless, they can escape Senate scrutiny but not Allah (swt).
@ANCALERTS Do you have proof of this? Before you accuse, show first the evidence just like what you did to Corona, public trial no evidence.
@FilY0 @donthebasher @wondergirlash @D0D0NNA @teta_limcangco @KenCallawood @Chip2chip2 @RenHu2 @jo2velasquez @DanSantos8 @JonJon_G8 Bato cries because he cannot stop the guilt in his heart &amp; conscience in following a tyrant's order. Do anyone of you knew Bato is a Muslim?
@News5AKSYON No plan to talk with a competitor ...
@PTVph Honestly, the public will not cooperate because even citizens became victims of the anti-insurgency campaign of the Army.
@FilY0 @DanSantos8 @wondergirlash @donthebasher @RenHu2 @jo2velasquez @teta_limcangco @D0D0NNA @Gabgrielle @JonJon_G8 @mila_d_aguilar You know what, the budget is with Duterte's blessing. Bato is just a frontline. If that budget is approved, the big slice of that goes to ?.

@Alakdan1102Eric @ilovetonita20 This is what you inherit from your leader, the butcher, a foul mouth and disrespect. Maybe you were not taught by your parents good ethics.
@argyllcyrus_MB @manila_bulletin The butcher tries to wipe out all his enemies so he can dictate everything to suit his derange mind. Nevertheless, The Almighty sees evythng
Funny, this administration blames a person a "yellowtard" if he/she outcries injustices and mis-governance. Trying to cover up REAL SCENARIO
@iamkarendavila That's good. Most of those who spread fake news are his followers. Let's see if someone is placed behind bars.
@joketerte30 Ha ha ha. Duterte admin is not actually build build build but KILL KILL KILL &amp; DESTROY DESTROY DESTROY PLUS LIE LIE LIE.
@edrlopez @mamimosca Honestly, the difference between Aquino and Duterte, the former is not a butcher like the latter.
@DanSantos8 @donthebasher Well, who can't be tempted of the venomous tongue of Duterte that was given by Satan? Even Kian's parents were trapped by this.
@anjpessumal @BalAnjongPong All the manipulative tactics are being done by Duterte to cover up the butchering they did to Kian and the other victims.
@ilda_talk Mocha is going beyond her tasks. She now backfights a Vice President, she just an employee who spends our taxes in flattery and immorality.
@iMthinkingPinoy All propaganda. But many Filipinos opened their eyes to what is really happening. A dictator and a tyrant and a liar has risen.
@nwlgrcia @BalAnjongPong Correct.
@Lowella45257768 @MochaUson Do you have proof on that?
@Miriamtdenzel @MochaUson I am so much updated of what is going on. However, I am not one of those who can be fooled by this administration and Mocha.
@MochaUson What is your proof?
@MochaUson Oh, my Is this the kind of official Duterte hires in his admin, a backfighter and a gossiper? You're paid Mocha by our taxes. Don't waste it

@argyllcyrus_MB @manila_bulletin There's proof he's involved but not shot dead while the poor Filipinos are being killed just for hearsay without documents to prove also.
@gmanews Kian's death is really a BIG ISSUE. And justice department wants it to be covered up. But TRUTH ALWAYS COMES OUT AND KIAN'S DEATH PROVED IT.
@thehill Russia is not bothered with US sanctions. Putin is an intelligent leader &amp; can always resolve whatever crisis Russia have. Trump's opposite.
@ilda_talk Really??? EDSA was the result of too much tyranny, dictatorship and oppression. Soon that will happen again because PRRD is a dictator too.
@palafo Welcome to Trump's presidency. Clinton never failed warning the U.S. citizens what will occur if Trump gets elected. Nobody listened.
@DanSantos8 The question is: How do Duterte knew a person's an idiot if it didn't pass thru due process? He's fond of accusing when he is an idiot too.
UNICEF calls for fair, transparent probe on Kian’s death https://t.co/x8b9NlS6tw via @manila_bulletin JUSTICE FOR KIAN.
These 2 resigns because they're not actually responsible of d release. It's somebody's order from PRRD's fam that gave the go ahead signal.
How a Muslim responds to haters: Sabr, Silence and a Smile.
I cried an ocean of tears but nobody cared.	I cried in Sujood and Allah (swt) gave me Sabr.
When someone or something is trying to bring you down, just smile and say..."You are a test that Allah has sent to me".
DESIRES make slaves out of Kings and 	PATIENCE makes Kings out of SLAVES.
If you get angry STAY SILENT.
There are no sad endings for those who trust Allah (swt).
If Allah (swt) is making you wait, then be prepared to receive more than what you asked for.
SABR: Patience is not about how long you can wait, but how well you behave while you're waiting.
It was not Muslims who made Islam Great.	It is Islam that has made the Muslim Great.
Islam does not dismiss desires rather it disciplines them.
Dua heals all negativity, hurt, anger, worries and depression. Pray to Allah daily.
You prefer the life of this world, while the hereafter is better and more lasting.
When someone is behaving unjustly to you,	find peace in the truth of the situation,	knowing that Allah (swt) is enough as a Witness.
What is JIHAD?	Smiling in tough moment is Jihad.	Keeping patience in hard times is Jihad.	Struggling for good... https://t.co/HFpYLJerJY
Trust Allah (swt) when things don't work out the way you wanted. Allah has something better planned for you.
The overly jealous seek to harm and hurt other, but in the end only harm themselves.
The worst of our faults is our interest in other people's faults.
No matter what your physical appearance, when you have kindness in your heart, you're the most beautiful person in the world.
When things are too hard to handle, retreat &amp; count your blessings instead.

@PhilippineStar @alexisbromero Well, do that and include your name on the list. Power is not forever. And what you did to poor people will go back to you. That's KARMA.
@PhilippineStar @alexisbromero Joma is correct!
@PhilippineStar @alexisbromero A statement of a stupid leader.
@PhilippineStar The Filipinos should wake up and comprehend that they voted a President who is a tyrant and a butcher. FILIPINOS MUST UNITE TO OUSTER HIM.
@PhilippineStar THE BUTCHER OF THE BANGSAMORO PEOPLE IN MINDANAO.
@PhilippineStar TRUMP A BIG FABRICATOR OF LIES. YOU DON'T KNOW THE REAL SCENARIO OF U.S. GENOCIDE ON MUSLIMS IN MINDANAO. UNTIL NOW JUSTICE WAS NEVER GIVEN.
@PhilippineStar DOJ just kept probing but nothing done to protect the rights of the Filipinos killed by butchers policemen without due process of law.
@PhilippineStar That budget should be scrapped and given to more projects and programs for the alive impoverished Filipinos, not to the police butchers.
@MochaUson The police kills their assets in selling drugs so that nobody will speak out who the real drug pushers are...THE POLICEMEN.
@MochaUson That was padded to cover up the real scenario. You cannot fool all of us.
@AbdulcaderAbbas @abuhilalah It is because Duterte want to annihilate Muslims and corrupt taxes. In war everything is unaccounted for.
Senators alarmed over rising number of killings in PNP anti-drug operations https://t.co/mcWMsPZ2ET via @manila_bulletin

@gmanews These are innocent Muslims arrested and accused as Abu Sayyafs  for AFP to show they're doing good with their attacks on Muslims in Mindanao
@jehqn Amazing talent you have there.

@ANCALERTS Another budget again for this. More taxes wasted. More hardships for the poor filipinos.
@dosfordos 99%
@Gabgrielle @_MsAsiaPacific_ CORRECT!
@iamrickbaltazar @imeldamarcosOFC @rapplerdotcom @MochaUson @MochaUsonOFC Ahah. Funny, Duterte keeps on lambasting the Prietos and now his appointing one in his cabinet. Something fishy is going on.
@ANCALERTS Who said so? Philippine economy is going down the drain., the lowest since the time of Estrada. Only FVR made PHL an economic tiger.
@MrFrankBaraan @_MsAsiaPacific_ IT IS BEING HIDDEN IN HIGH PLACES...PLACES OWNED BY THIS ADMINISTRATION.
@TheRickyDavila @_MsAsiaPacific_ ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. MS. HILARY NEVER WAS LACKING IN WARNING THE US CITIZENS WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF TRUMP GETS THE PRESIDENCY.
@Harperblammo @_MsAsiaPacific_ WE NEVER BELIEVED A WORD THIS PERSON SAID BECAUSE WE KNEW FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WHO HE IS, A TYRANT AND A DICTATOR.
@_QuePasaChica_ @_MsAsiaPacific_ Funny, these people are killed in cold-blood without giving them a chance to speak out if they are guilty or not.
@RenHu2 @_MsAsiaPacific_ They are being killed to silence witnesses to who really is the protector of the drug lords. SILENCE OF THE LAMBS!
@cnnphilippines @DickGordonDG We should be thankful there is a Senator Trillanes who scrutinizes current leadership. Because if there is none, TYRANNY WILL FLOURISH!
@yusufledesma Funny, Robin has to publicized his charity. If you're a real Muslim, the left hand will not know what the right hand gives to charity.
@cnnphilippines @DickGordonDG How about this...SENATORS AND CONGRESSMEN ALL MUST RESIGN BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT DOING THEIR JOBS WELL. PAYING THEIR SALARIES IS WASTE OF MONEY
@thehill Yes, he is still the same person who will bring US economy to oblivion and destruction.
@FilY0 @DanSantos8 @Gabgrielle @jo2velasquez @teta_limcangco @donthebasher @RenHu2 @JonJon_G8 @wejarlego @tolitsdfarmer @PunchTheLies ABSOLUTELY CORRECT! It is called DE-POPULIZING FILIPINOS  or KILLING THE POOR FILIPINOS &amp; MUSLIM PEOPLE.
@joym_speaks Absolutely right! Scrap Martial Law and condemn EJK.
@cnnphilippines I hope this donation will really go to the ppl of Marawi City victims not to pockets of politicians.

@KatarHol5 @BalAnjongPong Bingo!
@thehill Melania Trump must first give this advice to her husband before anyone else. Because it's Trump who manifests hate in public to opponents.
@iMthinkingPinoy The BIG LIAR and CORRUPTOR.
@thehill Correct.
@peddoc63 Not only acting, but above and beyond crazy.
@_MsAsiaPacific_ Well, pictures do not lie.
@thehill Trump is very fond of hearsay. Have the decency to prove it with concrete evidences before any accusation.
@_MsAsiaPacific_ @UPRinfo Finally, truth comes out. As the saying goes, you point a finger, three fingers pointing back on you. So who's most guilty?
@Behind__News This is the result of Trump's public display of his discrimination of color &amp; religion. A president shouldn't be bias.
@cnnphilippines Yes, it can't be controlled because his family is also in cahoots w/ drug smugglers. Only small time drug pushers were murdered, so unjust.
@washingtonpost I rally behind.
@BarackObama Yes, that's true. But if a President like Trump starts initiating racial discrimination, then chaos follows through. Blame is on Trump.
@DanSantos8 @donthebasher Subhanallah.
@NetworksManager Who said so? It is only Islam where Allah permitted "free will" to choose the path you will tread in this dunya. Read more to know the truth
@alozrasT Both! LOL
@rex_ballester @DingalMonico Changing tune?
@manila_bulletin Trump's threatening words against NoKor sign of arrogance and a mindless leader. Did anyone advise Trump when WW 3 erupts, millions wl die?
@manila_bulletin @MBvanneelaine Everybody knows Duterte has hidden wealth. Nobody just have d guts to come out in the open, only Trillanes. The wealth came from a treasure.
@manila_bulletin His arrival will not cover up the bad odor that came out in the open. Finally, the truth came out after so many years of hiding.
@AbdulcaderAbbas This is the result of  wrong decision made by the President. The declaration of Martial Law and the bombing of Marawi is beyond condemnation
@cnnphilippines Really! How easy to say when they can't even do good planning in Marawi City.
@yusufledesma Of course! That is expected.
@pctubezaINQ That money is difficult to sort out. The Free Tuition Program is just a propaganda of Duterte not a realistic one.
@cnnphilippines @AC_Nicholls How much goodwill could have Bautista had given to these employees to rally behind his ill-gotten wealth?
@cnnphilippines @AC_Nicholls Birds with the same feathers flock together. They flocked together to have a share of the pie.
@PhilippineStar Another source of income for Bautista.
@PunchTheLies @MrFrankBaraan @DiNaProfMSSyj @DanSantos8 @_QuePasaChica_ @RenHu2 @joketerte30 @donthebasher @GisingPilipino @KatarHol5 @KenCallawood Another smoke coming out in the open. Really, you can never contain bad odors or smokes. It always finds its way out so you can smell it.
@manila_bulletin US cannot beat North Korea. Why? Because they are all united as one with their President. Comparing US whose political system in disarray.
@thehill National Security is not the responsibility of Democrats. It is of the President and its security departments, they're paid to do this job.
@inquirerdotnet @gringo_honasan @MJcayabyabINQ Why only Gringo Honasan? How about the other Senators and Congressmen involved in PDAF scam including Duterte's allies?
@NancyPelosi You're absolutely right!
@gmanews @allangatus Funds for Free SUCs Tuition is far from reality. PHL is currently debt-strap bcoz of PRRD too much spending on his ML and travels abroad.
@RepAdamSchiff @POTUS Correct. Trump is just aggravating the situation and not thinking right. If war erupts, he would be safe in his mansion while millions die.
BPOs feared to take hit if tax breaks removed https://t.co/tGawez91IM via @ABSCBNNews This is good news as BPO's don't pay well Filipinos.
@gmanews The shipment cannot come in without approval of a "blue-collared politician" close to the president. Guess who is it? Use simple logic.
@SenFeinstein You are absolutely right. If Trump's admin do not resolve this, there will be a collapse on the US justice system and aftermath wl be fatal
@Behind__News From where???
@ANCALERTS Smoke really cannot be contained. It always finds its way to come out in the air. At long last BAUTISTA's ILL GOTTEN wealth came out.
@washingtonpost Time will come when NoKor will dominate the world and replace US world domination. This is KARMA of what US did to Muslims in Middle East.
@rapplerdotcom SEE! AM I CORRECT WHEN I SAID SIGNING "FREE SUCs TUITION" IS EASY FOR DUTERTE TO SIGN BUT NOT IMPLEMENTATION. ALL PROPAGANDA.
@AnnalisaBurgos Your wife of course!
@MrFrankBaraan You are absolutely correct!
@iMthinkingPinoy Really!!! A very weak alibi for an ill-gotten wealth. Bautista should be placed behind bars together with his collaborators.
@thehill It is a failure because Trump didn't exert more effort on national reconciliation. He focused more on backbiting his opponents.
@shecrisostomo @PhilippineStar This is a wrong perception. There are many tobacco users in this country but never got involved with drugs. Don't generalize.
@manila_bulletin These are facts that cannot be denied Duterte administration became worse than past presidents. He ridicule FVR but he's the best, GIR high.
The signing of FREE SUC's TUITION was signed. However, let us see if implementation is also done smoothly.
@MochaUson That is taxpayers money not owned by PRRD. It is not owing to PRRD this program but owing it to the Filipino people.

@ABSCBNNews WE RALLY BEHIND.
@cnnphilippines Yes, it's true. This is d legacy Duterte gave to d Maranaws. A sustainable hardship for the people in Marawi City because of wrong decision.
@washingtonpost The collapse of US economy cannot be prevented. Citizens should start thinking alternatives to prevent worse scenario because of this.
@PhilippineStar SCRAP MARTIAL LAW -- IT IS NOT THE SOLUTION TO MINDANAO PROBLEM. TRACE BACK HISTORY &amp; KNOW THE ROOT CAUSE OF MUSLIM REBELLION.
@PhilstarNews Mindanao problem cannot be resolved by ML. Only resolution is JUSTICE to d victims of PHL genocide in 1970s &amp; 2000 &amp; return of BM homeland.
@PhilstarNews The 3 justices are absolutely RIGHT!
Islam has raised the status of a Muslim woman from below the earth to so high that Paradise lies at her feet.
Blaming Islam for terrorism is like blaming christianity for colonialism.
Islam has raised the status of a Muslilm woman from below the earth to so high that Paradise lies at her feet.
A true Muslim is the one who avoids harming Muslims with is tongue &amp; hands.
Fear the prayer of the oppressed Muslims in Mindanao.
An oppressor destroys the world of the oppressed, and his own in the hereafter.
The destruction of Islamic City was blamed to Mautes. But who's bombing the place and on whose order --- Duterte. Muminoons can't be fooled.
When Duterte came to power, the majority are rejoicing, except me. Because I knew a new tyrant and butcher of Bangsamoro Muslims arise.
The Muslim Ummah is like One Body. If one part is in Pian, The whole body feels the pain.
@thehill Ivanka is a daughter of Trump and not part of US admin. It is not correct for her to sit on behalf of his father. It is unethical.
@cnnphilippines That is only in paper &amp; for 3rd world countries. First world countries violate this treaty.
@cnnphilippines How come the declaration took this long?
@inquirerplus @inquirerdotnet @TeamAFP Meaning AFP force is dwindling &amp; need more men. I wonder why? Duterte's not only killing Muslims but also soldiers bcoz of wrong decisions.
@cnnphilippines History repeats itself. A butcher of the Muslims, just like what happened in 1970s.
@gmanews Subhanallah. May Allah forgive you for your sins.
@gmanews Well..slowly, the real skin of Duterte is coming out.
@PTVph I hope this aid does not end up on politicians pocket.
@manila_bulletin @GenKabiling PH government way of bribing and convincing some Muslims that what they did in Marawi is justified. However, not all Muslims can be fooled.
@PTVph @ZeeAlontoAdiong @jervismanahan This is the result of wrong decision and leadership. I pity the Muslims who have been continually bombarded by the oppression of PHL govt.
@PhilippineStar Another "Black Propaganda" against the Muslims. Planting bullets in relief good just to portray AFP and PRRD are doing right with ML.
Those practicing Islam who ridicules Jihad are the people who are more attached to this dunya than Akhirah. Subhanallah.
The AFP seems to have this dilemma that Maute ISIS wants negotiation. Please note: Mujahideens don't negotiate. They rather choose death.

@etulfo2011 Who says the Maute are asking for a negotiation? Mujahids don't negotiate. They'd rather die a martyr than surrender to Kufrs. That's Jannah
@CNN Yes.
@newscientist The real cause of depression is because of absence of TAQWA and IMAAN.
@CNN That's not a mystery. It's because QATAR's economy is moving far ahead than its neighbors. And they want to destroy it but Allah knows best.
@thehill Always in the news that ISIS leader is dead but no proof of evidence shown. How can we believe?
@nytopinion Wrong assessment. ISIS is getting stronger as they are now scattered worldwide.
@cnnphilippines We can forgive but WE WILL NEVER FORGET!
@ANCALERTS It will never catch up because of negative mentality of politics in the country.
@Stcrow @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence Trump brags on NK treatment on US prisoners. How about US treatment on Muslim prisoners being tortured? Why don't you brag about it too?
@dindoflora @News5AKSYON We are hurt by the decision that you made. We suffered so high in this Ramadhan because of the disrespect. Nevertheless, Allah (swt) sees it
@dindoflora @News5AKSYON Apology accepted.
@CBSNews @CBSThisMorning The one driving his numbers down is HIS STUPIDITY.
@ANCALERTS I don't think so. China is just very cautious in dealing with North Korea. And that is an intellectual decision.
@DZMMTeleRadyo ...and they say " Davao City" is peaceful???
@cnnphilippines @ClaireCeldran All over media for weeks, the news is always "troops closing in" but until now, AFP troops did not succeed in restoring to order Marawi.
@cassiemaiden @gmanews I don't think so. You posted your photo for others to see and comment. So accept whatever is commented on you.
@gmanews Ride PISTON. We rally behind.

The real scenario in Mindanao. https://t.co/9Ouq9uydvm
'Jihad' can mean holy war to extremists, but it means a struggle to the average Muslim.
@MBChinoLeyco @manila_bulletin That will bury more in debt the Filipino people.
@jnery_newsstand @inquirerdotnet No. But when he die, he will be asked by Munkar and Nakir what he did to Muslims in Mindanao. He wl be held accountable of all the deaths.
@ANCALERTS Samira Gutoc seems to forget the rulings of Islam. You were one of those people who caused the hardships of the Muslims in Mindanao.
@DZMMTeleRadyo @EdSevidalDZMM Propaganda again.
@washingtonpost ISIS and HAMAS are one and same. Why? They're all Mujahids.
@ANCALERTS That is true.
@oscarfbtan @SolGenCalida @inquirerdotnet Martial Law is not the solution to the Moro Problem in Mindanao. The solution is to return the territorial homeland of the Bangsamoro people
@gmanewsbreaking @Rodveg72 Phase out of jeepneys will lead to too many drivers getting out of jobs. Whoever suggested this is INSANE. PISTON march is Legit.
@cassiemaiden @gmanews Well, when they face judgment day, then they will know how severe is a punishment from God for women who don't hide their aurat.
@PhilippineStar If this happens, lawlessness has begun in the Philippines.
@PTVph To become a MARTYR during the month of Ramadhan is victory for the Mujahids as they will inherit Jannah. While dying a kufr goes to hellfire
@PTVph In the ongoing war of AFP against Mujahideens, the one who become losers when they die are the kufrs not the Mujahids.
@CBSNews Yes, absolutely.
@manila_bulletin "Inna Lillahi Wa Inna Ilayhi Raaji'oon". May Allah (azzawajal) accept the Maute Mujahideens in Jannah.Ameen.
@victoriatulad @gmanews How unfortunate, he died a kufr.
@manila_bulletin This is how justice works in Philippines. The country cannot even upgrade these facilities so as to encourage criminals to be good.
@TeddyBaguilatJr It is because of wrong decision &amp; leadership. Martial Law aggravated the hardship of Muslims in Mindanao. Truly, PRRD has no mercy 4 Muslims
@inquirerdotnet The Muslims in Marawi City are suffering this time in Ramadhan. May Allah (swt) accept their sacrifices and protect them from kufrs.
@Etidal @abusulayman There is no such thing as extremist ideology. Western kufrs and murtads look at jihad as extremism when it is ordained by Allah (swt).
@gmanews Exposing your body to public is "haram". Surely, this lady do not know what is "chastity".
@ABSCBNNews Alvarez has no right to dissolve the court of appeals. This is arrogance and violation of the constitution. He should be impeached.
@Reuters Oh my.
@muscat_daily The Arab kingdom shuts down Al-Jazeera because Saudi prefer more to listen to Western media rather than Islamic views and comments.
@aliusmani @juneymb They want to shut Al-Jazeera in order to hide from the world the real scenario. Only Jazeera is telling facts compared to other media.
@M_MAHJOOB32 @AbdallahAtamna @MuammarGaddafiL @ragababrik22 @HalimaLY @libyanano2 @reemomar90 @bnhamel1 @alsg3an96 @y0sra_dream Are you sure?
@The_NewArab That is not correct. Saudi is deviating from Quranic precepts on how to conduct themselves in accordance with the Holy Qur'an.
@ryanmauro If Qatar supported Al-Qaeda Jihadists, the country is just doing what is ordained in the Holy Qur'an: "Spend your Money in Jihad."
@DZMMTeleRadyo @Dennis_Datu Martial Law did not help the people of Mindanao. ML further discriminate the Bangsamoro and aggravates more their hardship.
@ABSCBNNews @AbnerMercado WE CONDEMN US BOMBING OF MUSLIMS IN MARAWI CITY. PHILIPPINES VIOLATED THE PEACE AGREEMENT WITH THE BANGSAMORO PEOPLE.
WE CONDEMN THE US BOMBING OF MUSLIMS IN MARAWI CITY. PHILIPPINE GOVT VIOLATED PEACE AGREEMENTS WITH THE BANGSAMORO PEOPLE.
@cedric_castillo @gmanewsbreaking @gmanews US dropping bombs in Marawi City is violation against territorial laws of the Bangsamoro people. We condemn the US bombing.
@TVPatrol @rod_bolivar The accusation of Maute's mother that she is the financier is not true. She was just set up by the AFP.
@pia_gutierrez @cesdrilon This is the result of unhealthy decision of a leader.
@TVPatrol No amount of school supplies can appease the usurped freedom of these Muslim children. Free Marawi City from kufrs.
@patrol_ph @ABSCBNNews Marawi City since time immemorial is Islamic city. The flag of Allah should be the one flying above this city.
This sister cannot be charge with rebellion as she was not seen participating the battle. The arms taken from her possession were planted.
@DZMMTeleRadyo @AbnerMercado Martial Law has caused too much collateral damage among the Moros and the Filipino people. Duterte failed to seek advice re: Moro problem.
@TVPatrol @chiarazambrano Marawi City is an Islamic City. The flag to be raised up here should be the flag of ISLAM.
The war in Marawi City is an offshoot of Phils. NON FULFILMENT OF PEACE AGREEMENTS WITH THE MUSLIM PEOPLE.
@Gsquare9 @AJEnglish May Allah forgive you for using bad words.

It is not the ISIS that are killed in Mosul. ISIS was just made a cover up by the US Iraq troops so they can perpetrate genocide on Muslims. https://t.co/RFw5pyaPjZ

.@IraqiNews_com Iraqi forces did not control Western Mosul. They just did a mess on the lives of the people and kill innocent Muslims. Like US they butcher.
Iraqi forces control 90% of western Mosul : top commander https://t.co/S0dbadvJcO via @IraqiNews_com LIES. Not true.
32 IS fighters, including three leaders, killed in airstrikes, western Mosul https://t.co/8EHW6cRkxn via @IraqiNews_com THIS IS PROPAGANDA.
@AJEnglish Woe to these women! They will surely have their punishment in time.
@AJEnglish The bombing of US in Syria is not an addition to Trump's ratings rather adding up to US oblivion.
@AJEnglish @AJInsideStory It's a pre-planned strike.
@AJEnglish The real culprits in the genocide of Muslims is finally exposed by their own bombings.

@AF_Rizvi Pardon You were the first one who wrote me so I was not the one who bothered you. I am not oblige to answer you.
@Reuters @POTUS It was not Muslims who are guilty of terrorism. It is US who are the real terrorists because they invaded Muslim lands.
@AF_Rizvi Lots of things I know about Ukraine. Is being independent the same with being FREE?
@inquirerdotnet @cebudailynews Allah (swt) did not give any authority to any one to exact death penalty to any of HIs creation. It is HARAM.
@nytimes This will not only lead to partition but FREEDOM for Ukraine.
Trump's taxes policy proposals would help the rich and will eradicate Trump’s 2005 tax liability. It is not actually for the poor masses.
@Reuters US govt must dig deeper why their soldiers are in this situation. This soldier must be given chance to speak out his reasons.
@DJMikeDiesel You have great kids.
