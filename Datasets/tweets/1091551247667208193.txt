@HomeAdvisor All @HomeAdvisor is doing is giving bad companies and contractors a platform they should never have.  They don‚Äôt care, because in some cases they are making 3-$400 per lead on someone you could never get a hold of, And they won‚Äôt give you a refund. #HomeAdvisor
@HomeAdvisor Based on past experience, the majority of @homeadvisor contractors are actually just handyman who do a little bit of everything, and are not professionals at anything.  I‚Äôm actually being sued because one of their many trash Contractors. #HomeAdvisor
@HomeAdvisor With @HomeAdvisor, Contractors will literally pay hundreds of dollars just to make contact with one out of five leads, then you are competing with contractors who employ illegals, So you‚Äôll never get the job anyway. No verified insurance as well. #HomeAdvisor
@HomeAdvisor @HomeAdvisor  Will only give contractors a refund on bad leads(bad info, or wrong task) that are extremely expensive, only if you beg, plead, and threaten to cancel your account. Otherwise they tell you to get bent. 		We‚Äôre talking about thousands of dollars. #HomeAdvisor

@funder @MichaelCohen212 @mattgaetz will destroy him.
@AkumaRajio And from what it looks like Twitter was ready for this, and sites like Google are not. Twitter was removing comment blazing fast Last night
@AkumaRajio Part of my job is web design so when I heard about this feature I had a feeling this will be an issue, and from what I see it kind of works like back links when you‚Äôre doing SEO work for websites. Half of your comments or links stick, the other half are removed by the developer.
@AkumaRajio I have no reason to make it up. All the comments were removed from jacks page and Twitter this morning or earlier. Some were even removed within an hour last night.
@joncoopertweets @JacobWohlAlt @Twitter Jon is such a loser
@TeaPainUSA So many bots on your account.
@JacobWohlAlt krassensteins got you?
@EdKrassen @JackPosobiec bots, 16,000 of them per account. Just like wohl @TwitterSupport

@OfficialSPGB @JessieJaneDuff Go to another country with your socialism. You have no right to implement your failed policies on a country outperforming all socialist countries.

@madisongesiotto When can i get a date
@JRubinBlogger @BillKristol I bet both of your accounts are promoted by bots. Let‚Äôs find out.
@joncoopertweets @funder @TheDemCoalition Who are you? nobody.
@JimBobgraholski @egavactip When you‚Äôve been excited and promoting this new feature for days, he immediately always responds to your tweets, and then when you have one simple question about a potential flaw, he immediately blocks you. Fuck Gab
@JackPosobiec You‚Äôre welcome for the info on the Krassenteins Jack. I‚Äôm assuming 16,000 fake followers?
@funder @TheDemCoalition You clowns are nothing but a waste of time.
@JimBobgraholski @egavactip I‚Äôve visited 20 sites last night for example, put a comment on each one, I went back and checked 10 of the sites, on five of the sites the comments were removed, and not just mine, everybody‚Äôs. So then what is the point?
@JimBobgraholski @egavactip Dude all I‚Äôm saying is I asked him a simple question, and he immediately block me for no reason. You can test the system yourself, I was just curious. It‚Äôs not what they are selling is all I‚Äôm saying.
@JimBobgraholski @egavactip Then explain why he‚Äôs blocking anyone who questions or brings attention to the flaws in the product. There‚Äôs no reason to do that unless he‚Äôs trying to hide it.		Go lobby somewhere else man. I‚Äôm just stating facts
@JimBobgraholski @egavactip So when I politely asked Gab owner on Twitter why this is happening, and who is deleting the comments, he blocks me?		This guy has literally responded to my tweets almost immediately every other time.
@JackPosobiec The Krassensteins(@edkrass, @krassenstein have 16,000 fake followers a piece. @JackPosobiec @TwitterSupport @TwitterSafety
@Ilhan You‚Äôll be removed first.

@egavactip I tested it last night, I found serious flaws, when I asked the owner about it today, he blocked me on Twitter. Most of the comments get removed within hours. But he won‚Äôt talk about it because he wants sign ups.
@freedom_fyter Well as the web developer of Twitter for example, the first thing everybody did was troll Twitter and Jack. I don‚Äôt know man, I‚Äôm just stating the facts. I was asking gab the same thing?
@freedom_fyter So last night I commented on about 20 different sites, I went back to half of them, and half of my comments and everybody else‚Äôs were removed completely. 		That is either by the web developer or gab. That is why I asked the owner, and the reply I got was a block
@freedom_fyter As a web designer I had a feeling it will be an issue because I am notified every time someone comments on my site and I can delete it. But I was hoping for the best as I‚Äôm sick of Twitter.
@JackPosobiec Are we supposed to be scared of this guy now? It sucks he‚Äôs from my hometown. A complete embarrassment
@IlhanMN @Apple @Google Yeah but you support sharia, and sharia supports this.
@freedom_fyter They‚Äôre selling this extension as something greater than it really is. If your comments are deleted within a few hours or less, does it really have any value? But it sure is getting them sign-ups right?
@freedom_fyter Half of your comments get deleted within a few hours or less. I asked the owner about this on Twitter, instead of responding like he usually does, he blocked me.
#Gab #Dissenter @getongab https://t.co/O8qTBYqAU2

@ali @TwitterSafety @TwitterSupport @verified @TwitterComms All your followers have to do is report him under the auto reply function. If multiple accounts do it he most likely will be banned especially if it is a non-verified account.		I have accomplished this before with auto reply accounts.
@VisitBluePlanet @getongab Your comments will disappear within a few hours. On at least half the websites. When I asked the owner about this issue, he just blocked me. Seriously overhyped for signups.

@fireboatdriver @Cernovich @GuyDudeChief I tested it on 20 sites roughly last night, I went back and checked half of them, and at least half of my comments were deleted and so were everyone else‚Äôs.		When I tweeted at gab about this, instead of replying like he usually does, he just out right blocked me.
@PurpleSuede22 It‚Äôs a scam, most of your comments will be deleted within hours, at least half of them. Go back and check for yourself.

@HomeAdvisorHelp @HomeAdvisor @HomeAdvisor I‚Äôm in the full remodeling business in the south east United States, you need to bring somebody in that knows what the hell they are doing regarding pricing. 		This way the contractors that do work with you won‚Äôt be ones working out of their garage, no license/insur.
@HomeAdvisorHelp @HomeAdvisor @HomeAdvisor I‚Äôm noticing the competition though for the same leads is not what it used to be. It seems that everybody else has caught onto the fact it is a complete scam. You guys don‚Äôt understand what the profit is on these jobs, and you‚Äôre pricing is completely out of whack.
@HomeAdvisorHelp @HomeAdvisor @HomeAdvisor 	I‚Äôve literally paid over $1000 in the last two weeks for stone countertop leads for people I can‚Äôt get a hold of, or are not serious at all. Not one lead it was worth a damn. Now I have to sell two jobs via another source apparently, just to pay you guys.
@HomeAdvisorHelp @HomeAdvisor I‚Äôll pass. It‚Äôs always the same story with you guys when I call for two years, you‚Äôll give me free leads, that might be worth $20 a piece(while I paid $100 per lead), but you won‚Äôt refund the actual money. 		It‚Äôs a scam.
