@guspaul Post-nuclear option, yes. The Constitution lets the Senate make its own rules and does not require 67 votes to change them.
@kathoh You mean *negative* fiscal impacts beyond the 10-year-window. You could solve that with an exploding pineapple in year 10 IF DC statehood scores as a negative (not sure it would?).
@_Ben_Franklin1 Some people like the "citizen legislature" model. Some don't. I've seen some corruption at every level of government and every salary level but haven't studied the differences. One antidote: A vibrant press, which has been diminished dramatically in many state capitals.
@JonPKay Yes, but that's tantamount to the nuclear option. Call it the "Ted Cruz Option."
You couldn't use a reconciliation bill to say, increase the size of the Supreme Court to 15 or increase the minimum wage to $15. But you could go nuclear to do both of those things, IF you had 50 votes + VP.
(I think the answer is yes.)
Home sick. And because my brain is what it is, I'm having a random thought: Would D.C. statehood qualify for a budget reconciliation bill? 	(It would absolutely impact the federal budget).
Other items that almost certainly would not happen or would be MUCH harder without nuking the filibuster: DC Statehood. Puerto Rico statehood. Etc.
Some big Dem agenda items COULD get done in a budget reconciliation package with 50 votes, but the Byzantine rules &amp; keeping the party together on such a package would be VERY hard.	Medicare/ACA expansion, tax hikes, carbon taxes/subsidies can qualify IF you get the votes.
A smattering of Democratic agenda items likely DOA in 2021 without nuking the filibuster:	$15 minimum wage	Voting Rights Act/Campaign finance overhaul	Union rules/card check	Universal paid family leave/sick leave/vacation

Sorry this isn't really a fun fact.

It would be kind of a fun C-SPAN 4 reality show to have 100 U.S. senators individually show up at their planes, have their staffer deliver a salad, apologize that they forgot the damn fork and there are no forks on said plane, and see how they react.

While Congress has failed to reach a resolution over what to do with this population for decades, enforcing the laws on the books -- or not -- has been the yearly battleground. Democrats want focus on violent criminals.
The fight here is over the 11 million unauthorized immigrants already here -- many here for many years, with families, jobs, etc. Democrats and many Rs have long wanted to give those who haven't committed serious crimes a path to citizenship. Hardliners want deportations.
Told the transfer authority isn't new -- it just continues. But it has the effect of making the cap seem more real than it is. It's more of a soft cap, not a hard one. Lot of Ds aren't happy with stepped up interior raids and bed cap has been de facto limit on such enforcement.
Democrats think because the cap on average daily beds is lower than existing cap, ICE will have to reduce beds to 40,520 by Sept. 30. BUT Trump can just raid other security accounts again to bypass. So...?
Big win for Trump on ICE detention beds:	* Ds dropped demand for interior bed cap	* Trump can bust through new 45,274-bed total cap - itself a record - with $750M transfer authority. Per aide, Trump could hold as many as *58,500* - UP from 49,057 now.	https://t.co/6isW3vfcoJ

@OsitaNwanevu @billscher @TheMezcalJones @AJentleson A lot of GND items however clearly would be budget related, because you can tie them to taxes or spending items that would score and therefore be kosher under the rules without need for any extraordinary process hoop. Like I said, the bigger issue is getting 50 votes.
@OsitaNwanevu @billscher @TheMezcalJones @AJentleson There's an intermediate step shy of thermo-nuking the filibuster.

Fun fact: This was what Ted Cruz advocated for ACA repeal.

John Dingell fun fact: As a kid he shot rats in the Capitol basement
Couple of vintage John Dingell quotes:		‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt judge you whether you get a bill,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúThey judge you on what you get done.‚Äù		He told his staff: ‚ÄúYou go find the facts. We will cook the politics to suit the facts.‚Äù
Dingell came from a time when lawmakers spent a lot more time hanging out together, and across party lines. He lamented the polarized era that he told me came in with Gingrich, who he said warped the rules.
Republicans likes working with John Dingell; he once told Nancy Pelosi when they differed on energy legislation strategy that he wouldn‚Äôt deliver a Democratic bill but he would deliver a Democratic accomplishment. He was focused on getting a result.
I remember sitting down with John Dingell in his office; he told me stories about witnessing FDR‚Äôs Day of Infamy speech as a House page, of heading to WWII at age 18 a few years later, trapping bears, and his own art of the deal.	He was both larger than life and down to earth.
John Dingell kept the gavel used to preside over the Medicare debate in 1965 for decades; he spent decades after that trying to extend health coverage to everyone else. When ACA first passed House, Ds lined up with the tome so he could sign it. And he brought his gavel.

@TonyFratto Context for Graham's statement is his saying previous 3 presidents all sent troops to the border at various points...
"This is the defining moment of his presidency. It‚Äôs not just about a wall, it‚Äôs about him being treated different than every other president." - Lindsey Graham.
Graham said "not a damn thing" has changed about him, dismissing assertions he's changed now that he's golfing buddies with Trump.
Lindsey Graham doesn't see a legal problem with ordering the military to build the wall. Says the last 3 presidents sent troops to the border.		"What's the difference between barbed wire and a steel slat?" Graham asked.
"This is about more than a barrier. This is about us as a party," Lindsey Graham said. He fears there will be a war within the party over the wall if Trump as he expects declares an emergency to build it without a deal in Congress.
LINDSEY Graham has a warning for his fellow Republicans: Get behind Trump's wall emergency declaration, or else:	"To every Republican, if you don‚Äôt stand behind this president, we‚Äôre not going to stand behind you, when it comes to the wall" 	https://t.co/qS4oXxqCKx

Few ways Trump could have gotten wall by now:	1. Agree to $25B 2018 offer from Schumer for Dream Act+	2. Accept $1.6B fencing on offer from Senate Democrats last year before Pelosi got gavel	3. Border Control Reconciliation Act of 2017*	*High degree of procedural difficulty
Decent odds at the end of all of this Democrats agree to support fence $ as they have many times in the past ($1.6B in bipartisan Senate DHS approps matched Trump budget $ 100%!), Trump will say "I got my wall," Dems will be, like, "whatever," &amp; nation moves on to next episode.

There are Democrats who have said they'd still back the $25B wall/border bill tied to Dreamer path to citizenship from a year ago (Gillibrand, Coons, etc). But Trump vociferously opposed that bill because he insisted on cuts to legal immigration.
Trump has also insisted on curbs to legal immigration in any deal -- including his latest offer -- which Democrats consider to be a poison pill. 	Could there be a deal by Feb. 8 w/ border $/permanent Dreamers/TPS + other issues including caps, debt limit, etc?
CLYBURN floated a permanent DACA/TPS deal for permanent border barrier $ on Sunday, but insisted Trump reopen gov't for talks. McConnell has allowed Democrats a vote on reopening government for 2 weeks for talks on Thursday if Trump's fails to get 60.
One problem Democrats -- and Republicans -- have complained about all along: Trump's team has different camps &amp; no one knows what Trump is going to do day to day. Who do you negotiate with? Can you trust them? Ds say offers have to come from Trump &amp; they don't trust him either.
Clear WH/Rs really, really want a Dem counteroffer with wall money. But Democrats have insisted Trump reopen government before negotiating so it's not a hostage situation.

On Thursday they'll get to vote first to back Trump's (almost certainly doomed) plan to reopen government with wall, DACA relief and asylum restrictions, then vote on reopening the government for ~2 weeks. A senator could plausibly vote for both, nodding to both constituencies.
Also helps explain why McConnell didn't tee up votes on anything reopening the government until this week. Senators -- McConnell's flock -- as a rule don't like taking votes that are guaranteed to anger large numbers of their constituents.
As for getting to a veto override, I doubt these numbers are dire enough yet for a lot of Republicans to flip. You're risking a successfully primary challenge. Also helps explain why a lot of Republican senators want to be seen trying to find a solution but aren't attacking Trump

6) Comprehensive immigration overhaul. Lamar Alexander urged Trump to be "Nixon-to-China." Ds would have gone along with a lot more on legal immigration  changes -- the holdup on the DACA/wall deal -- if the 11 million had been addressed.
5) Get Mexico to pay for it. Democrats from the beginning have asked why Mexico isn't paying.
4) Nuclear option, pushed today by Trump and Steve Daines. End the filibuster. Requires 51 Republicans to back. Mitch McConnell opposes as do many other Republicans who signed a letter from Susan Collins backing the legislative filibuster.
2) Trump could have accepted other DACA-for-border offers made by Democrats.	3) Republicans could have passed a mandatory wall funding program in a reconciliation package (Cruz &amp; Co. suggestion). They didn't even try to pass a budget resolution this year, which is a pre-req.
Ways this wall shutdown fight could have been avoided in the previous 2 years:	1) Trump could have said yes to the bipartisan bill for $25B/10 for walls and such in return for DACA path to citizenship, etc. 	54 Senate votes easily would have gone much higher with Trump support
@Emma_Dumain He tweeted last night

Going to be interesting having Martha McSally and Kyrsten Sinema entering the Senate together after Sinema beat McSally.
Paul Ryan's House did pass a major attempt to cut spending: AHCA. 	But AHCA wouldn't have done much about the deficit because most of the savings went to tax cuts.	CBO scored it as a mere $119B cumulative reduction over 10 years.
So what happened to Paul Ryan's dreams of a balanced budget and paying down the debt?	Math:	CBO revenue is $278 billion less in 2020 than House GOP proposed in 2016.	(3680-3958= -278)	Spending $520 billion more than they proposed	(4163-4683= -520)
Chart #2: This is CBO's long-term adjusted baseline from April. It shows a $1.003 trillion deficit forecast for fiscal 2020.		Math: 1,003 billion - 195 billion = $808 billion in red ink. https://t.co/OAHGs5FGgn
Chart #1: This is the summary table of the fiscal 2017 budget proposed by House Republicans under Paul Ryan's leadership. It would have shrunk baseline spending by hundreds of billions a year while holding revenue stable.		I highlighted the deficit for fiscal 2020: *$195 billion* https://t.co/cH7LKDFYVO
The delta between the budget Speaker Paul Ryan's House proposed in 2016 and the reality Speaker Paul Ryan's Congress produced under Trump is about $800 billion a year in red ink.		That is not a misprint.
@RichardRubinDC Yes, although there is a salve of dramatically lower topline tax rates for those companies. You go back to the Roadmap he touts and he wanted a border-adjusted tax to replace the corporate income tax. Didn't happen because he ran into opposition from, well, certain interests.
There *are* special interests who got whacked in the tax bill. Housing interests saw the mortgage interest deduction nixed for most taxpayers because of the hike in the standard deduction; SALT cap at $10K especially hits wealthier people in higher-tax states, etc.
Paul Ryan wanted his bill to be revenue neutral, then gave up.	He said Republicans wouldn't blow up the deficit; the deficit just set a monthly record for November; corporate tax revenue has plummeted, spending soared and Ryan is touting a victory over "special interests." https://t.co/6LVyftkowb

@RichardRubinDC I misspoke and had two separate thoughts -- under existing law before this judge, individual mandate is a budget buster in future decades. Post-ruling, who knows how CBO would score a law in dispute? If you are reviving law with tiny mandate, deficit goes down? What about taxes?
@RichardRubinDC Reality is whatever John Roberts thinks about this is what will be. And maybe Kavanaugh and Gorsuch.
@RichardRubinDC Well, they'd have to waive paygo rules for that because it would score as a massive budget buster. And you can toss the CBO/JCT score of the ACA in the trash if this judge's ruling were to hold up.
@brendanmdunn Those work too.
@RichardRubinDC Unless he says it needs to be significant enough given 2010 law writers said it was essential...
@RichardRubinDC Not sure you can revive laws that way, but maybe if they had set it at some nominal amount way back when...
October 31, Trump said "Republicans will protect people with pre-existing conditions far better than the Dems!" https://t.co/2xdsUMBeQX

In October, I asked Mitch McConnell if the ACA lawsuit was a mistake: He said no, that it was no secret the GOP wanted to "start over" on health care. He'll get his chance if SCOTUS agrees with the Texas federal judge. https://t.co/UYG2lYs0P4
@McHugh The whole law. Toast.
Also gone would be Medicaid expansion money for many states, which in turn covers millions more.
@DrJoeDobrowski @BretBaier Except the law has kept working with it set at zero.
@brendanmdunn Zero-ifying. Nuking. Torpedoing. Gone.
The ruling came the evening before the final day of open enrollment for ACA plans. (Millions are eligible to sign up with large federal subsidies and no discrimination against pre-existing conditions -- which will all go to zero if the judge's interpretation of the law holds up.)

Have to read a little more about the ruling to see if this also eliminates all of the tax hikes in the ACA. Because how do you argue it is congressional intent to increase the budget deficit in such a way that would have violated the very budget rules used to pass the bill?
@nicholas_bagley Trying to wrap my head around this reasoning. They didn't do something, ergo, he gets to do it?
SCOTUS controls whether or not the ACA is eviscerated:	Roberts (Voted to save ACA last time)	Kavanaugh (Convinced Susan Collins, Manchin he wouldn't nuke ACA)	Gorsuch	Thomas (Voted to nuke ACA previously)	Alito (Ditto)	RBG, Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan have previously backed ACA.
Will Democrats agree to keep the government open without a guarantee ACA survives?
There are no senators who voted for the tax law thinking it would eliminate the ACA; it would never have passed with that understanding. Trust me, I've spoken to many, many, many senators about this. 	BUT, if this ruling stands, the ACA is gone, toast.
A Texas federal judge has ruled the ENTIRE Affordable Care Act unconstitutional because of the GOP tax law's gutting of the individual mandate.
That government shutdown fight just got a whole lot more interesting.
The Texas judge going against the will of many GOP senators who provided the key votes to zero-out the individual mandate to gut pre-ex conditions in a win for GOP senator-elect Josh Hawley. 	Expect SCOTUS fight. What will Roberts, Kavanaugh do??? https://t.co/xrWZQSovPp

Every American should know roughly how big the economy is, the budget, the deficit, total USA wealth, how much we spend on the military each year. And certainly our elected officials should know this.
So many people are so terrible at math.

@RyanRwolfe13 @benshapiro A lot of the stimulus was tax cuts. And a lot went to subsidize state governments so they wouldn't have to lay off teachers in the middle of a school year, etc. A small % of the stimulus actually went to "projects" of any kind.
@DamnedLiberal No, I read the story and the report it was based on and I read the federal budget for fun and for reporting. It does NOT say defense accounting errors cost $21T.
@see_karma @Ocasio2018 $21T was not spent. Period. Per @Brian_Riedl, the *total* spent on defense since 1789 is $18T.
@DamnedLiberal I'm anti-bad math.
@see_karma @Ocasio2018 Keep reading to the "to be sure" graf.
@Ami_Marisol It happens. But bad, magical math isn't going to fix a darn thing. There isn't a $21T tooth fairy at the end of the rainbow that will allow free lunches for everybody.
@see_karma @Ocasio2018 Yes, I did. The article makes clear they aren't contending $21T was spent (which it wasn't.)
@Ami_Marisol I get similar response from Trump fans when he flubs math.
@randomsubu @Brian_Riedl @thenation The article has a "to be sure" graf noting they aren't saying $21T was actually spent, that this was a combo of assets/liabilities over a long period of time. If you include the same large asset/liability irregularities year after year, you aren't spending new $.

@Brian_Riedl Just looked up your reports on Obama and Bush to refute!
If you wanted to find $21T since, say, 2001, you could. That's ballpark the cost of all of the debt-financed legislation in that time -- tax cuts, defense/etc buildup after 9/11, wars, Medicare Part D, stimulus package, more tax cuts + the pre-existing debt + interest.
Now, it's true that we have spent many trillions on defense, and if we hadn't spent those trillions, we'd have more money for butter (health care, etc.). 	Just not $21T.
cc: @Ocasio2018 Just because there were lots of unexplained line items on a financial report does not mean the military actually spent $21T on waste or accounting errors. (They didn't).
Like, $21T is more than the ***entire defense spending*** in that time period. And no, you can't use money we've already spent to pay for a future program because instead we are paying interest on the debt-financed spending we've already spent. Just so much bad math.
