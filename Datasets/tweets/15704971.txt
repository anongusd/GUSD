"He has no basis to do that. He‚Äôs just a political hack. He‚Äôs trying to build a name for himself... No other politician has to go through that. It‚Äôs called presidential harassment. And it‚Äôs unfortunate. And it really does hurt our country," Trump said of Schiff.

The Democratic women had a field day with this line "No one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year" congratulating each other and hugging

In the crowd tonight are several Senators and a few House members thinking about running for president themselves in 2020. Sen. @KamalaHarris and @SenWarren, who have both announced bids are sitting next to @SenSherrodBrown, who is contemplating a bid
The shushing was by other Democrats and folks watching on television tell me that it looked like Pelosi put her hand up to halt them at about the same time. (I can't see her from my seat in the press gallery)
A few Dems couldn't control a laugh or muttered boos when President Trump said "An economic miracle is taking place in the United States -- and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations," but they were shushed fairly quickly
"The state of our union is strong," Trump says.		It's fairly rare for presidents to describe it otherwise. Gerald Ford in 1975 said "the state of our union is not good," but not others
Not sure if you can tell on TV, but every time on side of the room jumps to their feet to clap, they all immediately look to the other side of the chamber to see who stood and who didn't
"We must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution -- and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good," Trump says.		Lots of whispering in ears on the Dem side of the chamber but no reaction to the resistance line
Also, interesting that Pelosi didn't introduce President Trump like the schedule‚Äîor tradition‚Äî dictates

Lots of applause as President Trump enters the chamber, though less enthusiastically from the Dem side of the room.
So far this feels like a pretty routine #SOTU. Both Democrats and Republicans clap as the first lady and the president's cabinet enter the room
And the Supreme Court arrives. Only four of nine attending the #SOTU this year: Roberts, Kagan, Kavanaugh and Gorsuch
Worth noting that most of the female Senators did not follow the House lead in wearing white
Dozens of Democratic women are wearing white tonight, a nod to the color worn by women suffragettes as they fought for the right to vote. For the first time, more than 100 women are serving in Congress. Wearing white to the #SOTU has become a bit of a trend.
.@KamalaHarris just entered the chamber and is getting a lot of love from the Congressional Black Caucus. 		I haven't seen @SenFeinstein yet, but it's a bit of a crush down there.
Members were reserving spots on the aisle hours before the speech was set to begin. Rep. Doug LaMalfa was among the handful of reps who had already staked out their seats along the main aisle by 3 p.m. today hoping for a highly televised handshake as Trump enters the chamber.
Lots of bipartisan handshaking along the aisle as the Senate moves slowly into the House chamber. California freshman @katieporteroc got a prime spot right by the door.
Here come the Vice President and the members of the U.S. Senate
As always members are flagrantly violating the no photos in the House chamber rule. So. Many. Selfies.
We're about 25 minutes out from the beginning of the #SOTU and members are already gathered in the chamber. The dozens of female representatives wearing white is STARK. If you ever needed a visual representation of how many women the Democrats elected this will drive it home
"We are ready to reject this foolish proposal in court the moment it touches the ground," @AGBecerra will say about declaring an emergency to build a wall at the southern border in his Spanish language response to the #SOTU
.@AGBecerra will say tonight "the idea of declaring a nonexistent state of emergency on the border, in order to justify robbing funds that belong to the victims of fires, floods, hurricanes, and droughts, to pay for the wall is not only immoral, it is illegal."

Because I've been using the term without explaining it, a CODEL is a trip abroad by a group of members of Congress. They are usually bipartisan and are intended to give members a first hand view of an issue or topic Congress will likely consider.
.@Noahbierman has the answer to one of my questions. A White House official says all congressional CoDels will be canceled during shutdown, not just those involving Pelosi.
RT @Noahbierman: A White House official says all congressional CoDels will be canceled during shutdown, not just those involving Pelosi.
Members also normally don't disclose foreign trips until after they have returned for safety reasons, is it still safe for Pelosi to go now that the president told  millions of people about the trip?
When was this CODEL going to take place? The House and Senate both cancelled their recess next week and will be in Washington.
Lot unclear here. Under what authority is the president cancelling a trip by the Speaker of the House? Is he canceling all CODELs during the shutdown or only Pelosi's?
President responds to Pelosi urging him not to give the State of the Union during the shutdown by saying he is canceling her trip to Brussels, Egypt and Afghanistan.

"Guided by the vision and values of our Founders, the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform and the aspirations that we have for our children, let us meet that responsibility with courage, wisdom and grace," Pelosi says
"As we take the oath of office today, we accept responsibility as daunting and demanding as any that previous generations of leadership have faced," Pelosi says

"Some have said in the last few days, 'this is an end of an era.' But it does not have to be. Perhaps it's an invitation to fill the hole that has been left behind," Rev. Russell Levenson, Jr. said at #GeorgeHWBushFuneral
"My hunch is heaven, as perfect as it must be, just got a bit kinder and gentler," Rev. Russell Levenson said at #GeorgeHWBushFuneral
‚ÄúThrough our tears, let us know the blessings of knowing and loving you,  a great and noble man. The best father a son or a daughter could have.  And in our grief, let us smile knowing dad is hugging Robin and holding  mom‚Äôs hand again,‚Äù President George W Bush said of his father
‚ÄúThe most decent and honorable person I ever met was my friend George Bush, one of nature‚Äôs noblemen. His epithet, perhaps just a single letter. The letter L for loyalty. It coursed through his blood," Sen. Al Simpson says at #GeorgeHWBushFuneral
‚ÄúHe was a man of such great humility. Those who travel the high road of humility in Washington, D.C. are not bothered by heavy traffic,‚Äù Sen. Al Simpson says at #GeorgeHWBushFuneral

Law enforcement told reporters this morning that it could take up to a week to clear the scene inside the synagogue, which the medical examiner described as "casings everywhere." Bowers had an AR-15 and three Glock .357 handguns, according to the charging document
According to the charging document, Bowers repeatedly spoke about genocide and his desire to kill Jewish people while engaging with officers, including saying "I just want to kill Jews."
In the charging document, the Department of Justice says the suspect Robert Bowers killed 11 people across three floors of the synagogue and appeared to be leaving when he first engaged police.
The names of the people killed at the Tree of Life Synagogue were released this morning. Youngest aged 54, oldest aged 97. Includes a married couple and a pair brothers

RT @_cingraham: Federal government is spending $236 million on federal civilian pay (excl. benefits) in 2018. A 2.1% pay increase works out‚Ä¶
"These alternative pay plan decisions will not materially affect our ability to attract and retain a well‚Äëqualified Federal workforce," the president says in his letter to Congress.
Federal law lets the president change federal employees' pay scale because of "national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare."		Trump said in his letter to Congress that "I view the increases that would otherwise take effect as inappropriate."
Along w/ cancelling the 2.1% pay increase for all federal employees, Trump also cancelled locality pay increases (increases based on where a federal employee lives) averaging 25.7%. Federal employee groups have been pushing for this for awhile. It was going to cost $25 billion
Most of the country's two million federal employees don't live in Washington, D.C. California alone is home to about 250,000. 	@GOVERNING has a great graphic where you can look up how many people in your state are federal employees https://t.co/sBb4rorZn0
