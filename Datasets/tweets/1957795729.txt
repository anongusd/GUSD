“Come senators, congressmen	Please heed the call	Don't stand in the doorway	Don't block up the hall	For he that gets hurt	Will be he who has stalled	There's a battle outside	And it is ragin'.	It'll soon shake your windows	And rattle your walls	For the times they are a-changin'.”

@barbara_crafts @RepDanCrenshaw Also, I do have a front door. It would be pretty cold if I didn’t.
@barbara_crafts @RepDanCrenshaw I never said the Vatican is ridiculous, and yes, I occasionally leave my house unlocked.
@barbara_crafts @RepDanCrenshaw And comparing walls around houses to walls around countries is ridiculous on so many levels. Different funding sources, size of perimeter, and source of threat for starters.		Also, the idea that Obama has a wall around his house has been debunked.
@barbara_crafts @RepDanCrenshaw The Vatican is 0.2 square miles (smallest country in the world). Despite the existence of a wall, millions of tourists per year visit St. Peter’s Square. The wall was built in the 9th century and is no longer used for national security. 		Not a good comparison.
@RepDanCrenshaw I like you as a person, but you’re very wrong on this. There’s a reason countries have moved beyond walls as a national defense strategy: they’re expensive to build and maintain, and they’re incredibly ineffective.

Oil &amp; gas companies would take a hit, power generation is a significant source of their demand. Coal would be completely done, but is headed that way anyway (not because it’s dirty, but because gas is cheaper &amp; more efficient).
Independent power producers (whose only function is power generation) could be displaced. Possible need for local, grid-stabilizing, non-renewable power source, but would likely be fulfilled by utilities themselves.
Local utilities &amp; system operators would still be needed to manage regional grid, distribution, billing, service to end customers, and could still recover costs of stranded generation assets. As those assets are decommissioned/depreciated, power prices would decline significantly
Disadvantages:	-How to fund???	-Disruption of local ecosystem &amp; population.	-How to set global transmission rates?	-Grid reliability.	-What happens during global/regional conflict?	-Grid/asset security?	-Concentration of assets, exposed to geographic/political/weather risk.
Advantages: 	-Reduce/eliminate carbon emissions resulting from energy production. 	-Lessen the global influence of OPEC.	-Eliminate need for solar/wind farms in populated areas.	-Opportunity to create peace through shared economic interests.
Next we need to build a cross-border, global power grid.
“the solar and wind farms that were simulated in this study are the size of entire countries – 38 times larger than the UK. They would be vastly bigger than any existing solar and wind farms, *and could provide up to four times as much energy as is currently consumed globally*.” https://t.co/7oCG3y57VG

@rep89 @JasonLiimatta @GovWalker @wisgop @WIAssemblyGOP My point was that it’s misleading to attribute the entire 30% drop in premiums to GOP/Walker policy when there were other more impactful factors at play. The article attributes 1/3 of the decline to policy.
@rep89 @JasonLiimatta @GovWalker @wisgop @WIAssemblyGOP “Common Ground Healthcare was new to the market and did not know what costs it would incur. It therefore was cautious in how it priced its health plans in the county.”		There is also competition this year (Molina will return to the market) which helps to drive down prices.

@gypsy_journals And having been on both sides of valuations (auditing and executing), this methodology was so obviously fraudulent it would be caught by a first year accountant at any Big 4 firm. I’m just blown away by how brazen this scheme was. Not even an attempt to adhere to the rules. Ugh.
@gypsy_journals I’m most upset by how broken the tax system has to be to allow this to happen. Every dollar spent funding the IRS generates $10-$18 of return (I’ve seen a range of estimates). If Rs were running the govt like they’d run a business, this would be a day 1 initiative.
@coreyhess10 Believe so. Any fines levied by the IRS include interest as well. 		Agree on taxes, it was the worst part of the accounting curriculum and the CPA. I bet by the time you take tax they’ll be using this as a case study since it encompasses so many different parts of the tax code.

@GovMikeHuckabee You’re holding a comedian to a higher standard of morality and decency than the President. Also, speech that promotes or exhibits bullying, vulgarity, and hate is protected under the 1st Amendment.
Postal banking would cost taxpayers nothing, give the USPS an additional source of revenue, and reduce the burden of interest/fees on low income Americans. This is truly win-win policy, and should gain bipartisan support. https://t.co/dVyA7xZaUS
