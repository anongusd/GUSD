Why is it ok now for AOC to criticize billionaires..the nazis vilified the Jews 4 owning businesses and being successful &amp; used it as an excuse to appropriate their property &amp; persecute &amp; kill them @benshapiro @scrowder Its the beginning of a dangerous road when a society starts
The leftist regressive agenda isnt the problem it is a symptom of the dire sickness infecting the nation We hve seen historically how this sickness has infected countries in the past &amp; we hve seen even recently the consequences this philosophy will reap as it seeps into a society

I guess Howard Scultz is a degenerate racist for not playing a multi enthnic music selection at Starbucks. Cause yah know that was probably one of his main job duties as the fucking CEO and everything. @benshapiro @The_DailyWire https://t.co/ZCZm9l040O
How can you pay for all of your welfare programs and universal everything while having open borders. #BuildTheDamnWallNow
Left in meltdown mode over Howard Schultz....I mean now Starbucks is racist and wants to ruin the left's chances.... But more importantly where are they going to get there 5 dollar lattes.
We will also continue to use the #aocislunacy hashtag, cause why the fuck not
Due to the constant barrage of ridiculous assertions put forth by the left as serious, this Twitter will now serve to debunk the entirety of the radical left not just AOC. The Avatar will remain.

Since when is poverty immoral. Jesus was poor. Why is the left so concerned with equality of outcome? Or yeah because conveniently they would be the logical choice to rule over such a society.

The Washington Post says that #AOCisLUNACY is "playing fast and loose with the statistics" she also would like to play fast and loose with our individual freedoms and our national sovereignty #AmericaFirst #BuildTheWall https://t.co/GOCx37ChDE
#AOCisLUNACY can't seem to come to terms with the fact that the country is basically a fair and equal place. If her dystopic fantasy of America isn't true, she is worried we wouldn't need a huge gov apparatus w/ politicisns like her in power to make decisions for the people. https://t.co/oUU62OnrCM
When even the Dems push back on you for being too extreme, do you stop and think, "Have I gone  to far? Too much too soon? Am I crazy?" Or do you, you know, keep on soldiering on w/out a clue what this country actually stands for. I think she is going for option 1. #AOCisLUNACY https://t.co/75HlvGnegq
#AOCisLUNACY #maga. This article brings up a good point, while conservatives are derided at every turn and every assertion over analyzed AOC is given full rein to make any claim she wants without a an oucne of scrutiny by the #FakeNewsMedia. #MediaBias https://t.co/ugQKdvgobj

@AOC she doesn't just want to stop the #BuildTheWalll.
