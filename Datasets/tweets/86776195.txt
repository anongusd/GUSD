Thankfully, many communities are uniting against hate. https://t.co/klxguHc8Ih
Per the Chicago PD report, “one of the offenders wrapped a rope around [Smollett’s] neck.” The use of the rope is symbolic of domestic terrorism rooted in American history: https://t.co/bLBqD1aqll
Yet, opponents of equality continue to oppose efforts to include LGBTQ people in federal laws. The Liberty Counsel claimed that including sexual orientation and gender identity in an anti-lynching bill was an attempt to “push unrelated policy agendas.”	https://t.co/E1Z3bIx3ms
LGBTQ people might not report incidents due to a lack of trust in law enforcement, and agencies may fail to record incidents as hate crimes. https://t.co/IG7TNdoQWo
These numbers do not reflect the full extent of the problem. Discrepancies between state and federal data and the exclusion of entire states highlight the need for better data collection. https://t.co/GuAJlCUBRC
Sadly, these attacks are all too common—in 2017, more than 8,000 people were targeted in hate crimes.   		Most were driven by bias against race/ethnicity (60%), predominantly anti-African American, followed by religion (21%) and sexual orientation (16%).	https://t.co/gWk8pJT2yx

The substantial lack of data on LGBTQ workers poses serious challenges. Small samples also make it hard to address disparities within the LGBTQ community by race, gender, and other intersecting identities.
The unemployment rate may be at prerecession levels, but other labor market health indicators have yet to recover fully. We must ask: are some workers--including LGBTQ workers--left out of the recovery?

ICE is ignoring its own policies around the safe placement of LGBT people and placing them in harm’s way: https://t.co/TxcDVcvlyo
Our full statement here: https://t.co/bnEvYjQ4Hi
Not only is ICE placing LGBT immigrants in harm’s way, but the agency has also reverted to its practice of detaining transgender women with men or in solitary confinement, contrary to its own rules
Although LGBT people accounted for just 0.1% of ICE’s detained population in FY 2017, they accounted for a staggering 12% of victims of sexual assaults reported in ICE detention
Disturbing new government data shows that LGBT immigrants held at federal detention centers are 97 times more likely to be sexually assaulted than other detainees, per our analysis

Conversely, the citizenship question was added out of the blue, and it hasn't been used in decades. Dr. Sean Cahill adds that it's important to consider motive: the citizenship question is designed to disenfranchise people. (2/2)

"Apart from the fact that wedding cakes are not religious icons, it is typically a wedding officiant who proclaims ‘that a marriage has occurred. … Indeed, neither Phillips nor his cake would have actually ‘participated’ in a wedding at all."

Falsehood 2: Rejected couples can get their cake down the street		Service refusals cause dignitary harm to LGBTQ people and can manifest in increased mental health disparities. It also overlooks the impracticality of assuming other businesses are available to the rejected couple.

LGBTQ patients are still protected from discrimination under the ACA, but HHS recently indicated they will re-write the rule
Health care entities were able to change policies and train staff to improve the quality of care without wasting time and money on litigation

A9. #InclusivePaidLeave policies are most effective when caregivers also have other critical supports, such as home and community-based care services and labor protections, including the ability to collectively bargain https://t.co/mx0dRXqNwj
A8. To ensure LGBTQ people have access to #InclusivePaidLeave regardless of their ZIP code:	1. Enact paid leave policies cover chosen family	2. Pass comprehensive nondiscrimination protections	3. Improve data collection and research on chosen families	https://t.co/HwjqboPxSj
A7. Our earlier report highlights many stories of chosen family relationships. For example, Terrie cares for her partner’s children to whom she has no legal ties, and for the child of a friend who lives with her: https://t.co/HwjqboPxSj #InclusivePaidLeave
A7: When holding other characteristics constant, an individual was significantly more likely to have taken time off to care for chosen family if they identified as LGBT or reported having a disability: https://t.co/mx0dRX9c7J #InclusivePaidLeave
A7. 42% of LGBT individuals report doing so, which is significantly higher than the rate for non-LGBT individuals at 31%: https://t.co/mx0dRX9c7J #InclusivePaidLeave
A7. The idea of chosen family may be more common than people think: nearly a third of respondents in our survey reported having taken time off work to care for a friend or chosen family member with a health-related need. #InclusivePaidLeave https://t.co/mx0dRXqNwj
A6. #InclusivePaidLeave is especially important for LGBTQ older adults. 42% of LGBTQ baby boomers said that they would depend on close friends in an emergency compared to 25% of the general population
A6. Even when LGBTQ workers have access to paid leave, they are vulnerable to being fired or discriminated against with impunity if they live in any of the states without employment nondiscrimination laws https://t.co/Hwjqbp78JR #InclusivePaidLeave
A4. Thousands of couples—both same-sex and different-sex—are still registered as domestic partners, and may choose not to marry for practical, philosophical, cultural, or financial reasons. They should not be left out of #InclusivePaidLeave https://t.co/Hwjqbp78JR
A4. Many LGBTQ individuals rely on friends and informal support networks, especially if they face stigma within their families and communities of origin, but policies might not recognize their chosen families #InclusivePaidLeave
