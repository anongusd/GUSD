@alexfeaker I'll need to change that information! Sorry for any confusion.
@alexfeaker From our website: DMACC allows instructors several days after a class is completed for grading. Grades are then electronically submitted to the Registrar‚Äôs Office. If it has been a week since the course ended, contact your instructor to see if grades have been submitted.
@alexfeaker Alex, final grades appear about a week after the semester end (which was December 15).
The reason why people give up so fast is because they tend to look at how far they still have to go, instead of how far they have come.
