Congrats @Scholten4Iowa!  https://t.co/Cm6L6MyqiM
And here it is https://t.co/pC5dxLbR8J
Well...  so true! We likely need another thread on media accountability! https://t.co/chptGz9C14
And we believe every community has the right and responsibility to continue to work with their elected representatives long after Election Day to ensure they remain connected and accountable.
We are working with @mallardforva and other candidates who we genuinely believe are running for office because they know their communities, care what happens in those communities, and believe they can make them better.
There are no easy answers. If someone tells you democracy is simple, they are lying. It is messy. It is uneven. It is hard. But you asked ‚Äî what‚Äôs the point? The point is self-governance is the most important tool we have against tyranny. The people must have a voice.
For example, @ColorOfChange and @BYP_100 focused on district attorney races in 2016. Helping reveal their role in the justice system. Young voters and voters of color flipped more than a dozen seats and have stayed involved daily in accountability efforts for the new DAs
And at 3P we believe deeply in the power of communities to shift incentives for their elected officials. It is hard. It takes constant vigilance, but we believe communities can help their elected officials not ‚Äúsell out‚Äù by applying counterweight of people power against money.
Another fix is to give the people back our airwaves. Buying radio and tv time is basically impossible for working class candidates. We could level the playing field a bit by insisting media play the role they are supposed to in a democracy and ensuring candidates have airtime.
Another fix is to ‚Äúget the money out of politics‚Äù. That is a tough and long road and a worthy one to pursue! Many smart people working on it. I‚Äôd be 3P would be happy to post some our favorite books and articles to our website about this issue.
One fix is to only have candidates who are independently wealthy and can pay all their own expenses. Supposedly that will make them independent. Sometimes it does. Often it also makes them utterly out of touch.
What does money buy for a first time candidate? It buys professional campaign staff to advise you. It buys mailers and advertising so voters know your message. But voters are right to worry that a candidate will get to office and have to ‚Äúrepay‚Äù by forgetting voter needs.
There is no doubt money in many different forms has an outsized impact on our elected representatives. It is basically impossible to win elections, even very local elections, without a lot of money. For Congressional elections. its money than most voters will ever earn.
Let‚Äôs reframe this a little. I don‚Äôt think everyone sells out. I do think everyone responds to incentives. So we should ask what incentives have we baked into our Democracy.
Ok listen! I consider this a fair question‚ÄîI want to respond with a few tweets rather than just one, but please don‚Äôt take this as an attack. It is a very important and complicated challenge. https://t.co/ZBaYwjFYpa
