@GOPLeader How did that work out for you?  Easiest way to get your State of the Union address would be to open the government back up.
@marcorubio @jguaido How are the hurricane victims in the panhandle?   Puerto Rico?  These are your constituents and you never tweet about them.
@charliekirk11 Did you know the House passed 10 bills that would open the government today?   @senatemajldr refuses to let the Senate vote on them fearing they may pass.  That's failing.
@MarkWarner You are asking and expecting private businesses to take the hit for the shortcomings of the government you are part of? Nice.

@realDonaldTrump Except for soybeans
@realDonaldTrump We need to build a Great Wall on China's Border with North Korea.  You can demand that Mexico will pay for it.
@krassenstein Finally, Trump properties are making a profit.
@marcorubio @NicolasMaduro What are you going to do about our dictators demands here in the USA?
@realDonaldTrump You are not King.  You can not demand anything.
@GOP What's the participation rate?   How many have just quit looking?
@JimGrayCongress Based on comments it would seem you are the one flat wrong.
@realDonaldTrump If I was in your shoes, I would want prison reform too.
@davereichert Do you guys have a form tweet you all send out in these circumstances to act like you care?  Everyone of you say the same things.  20 some odd school shootings this year and you are all still saying the same thing.
@politico That's a downgrade
@VP Do you just copy and paste, and then fill in the blanks the same thoughtless tweet for each school shooting?
@SenTedCruz You should stay off of Twitter today.   You and your NRA A+ ratings are part of the problem.
@JRubinBlogger @realDonaldTrump would have been better off using legal zoom.
@axios Did he add the part about, "and we are going do absolutely nothing to address this problem?"
@ABC Those are not words from a leader.
@realDonaldTrump You forgot thoughts and prayers.
@RandPaul You are showboating.  You bring up a bill that has zero chance of passing. You are campaigning, not legislating.
@SenTedCruz @netanyahu I'm sure it was on tax payers dime.
@DarrellIssa @realDonaldTrump When you equate people with animals it makes it easier to justify taking the children from the mothers.
@DonaldJTrumpJr So the rich boy criminal is calling others involved in criminal enterprise "animals."   Isn't that special?

@ScottforFlorida So you think you can go to Washington as a Freshman Senator and make huge changes in the system because of personal charm?  Just like your term limits thoughts, this has zero chance of passing. Who do you think you are fooling?
@RealAlexJones I think the alien gay frogs have gotten into system.  They are mad about the lack children being sent to Mars for slaves.  Bill Clinton can help you.
@realDonaldTrump Our country is under siege.  There is a massive crime problem coming out of the White House, and Congress is doing little to help.

@RandPaul You like to bark up storm acting like you care, but the bottom line is you will do whatever @realDonaldTrump tells you to do.
@RepPerlmutter I'm sure legalizing marijuana has a lot to do with that.  Free enterprise and a huge tax source.  Win win.
@realDonaldTrump You are just a big chicken if you don't use those magical presidential powers.   What are you afraid of?
