@RDH83 @THE_SC_GOAT @traderadio What they wanted is basically three picks around 20. A WCE second rounder next year will be more like 35 you‚Äôd expect. It isn‚Äôt like the Cats were chasing the number 1 pick.

@IAmJericho Hypothetically, if he shows up, unless he‚Äôs the surprise opponent for Eli Drake, where would he fit in? Jericho doesn‚Äôt seem like the guy who‚Äôll just show up for the cash and to do something random, there‚Äôd have to be a match, or a story, or something to build to.

@traderadio if the Crows was to get up the draft order, would their three first rounders be worth 2/3 from Gold Coast? Even throwing in next year‚Äôs first rounder? @sam_mcclure #NABTradeRadio
@paigecardona Hogan and Rory Lobb transforms that team. Now they might end up with none. Apeness/McCarthy is not a forward pair worth fronting up with.

@JJWilliamsWON @IAmJericho JeriGOAT
@aussiefootynet @leachitup Yeah, but if that reason is accurate, and Cats can get a better deal from Fremantle, he shouldn‚Äôt have an issue going there. Saying he doesn‚Äôt want to play for the Dockers doesn‚Äôt hold with the ‚Äúgo home‚Äù reasoning.
@traderadio Isaac Smith, Dion Prestia, Andrew Gaff, Dyson Heppell, Luke Parker, all in the conversation
@IAmJericho And just like that, when you‚Äôre done with EVIL you‚Äôve got another contender.
@thelistmanager Late first round
Geelong got to trade for a mature age SANFL player as part of the concessions to Carlton/Gold Coast. They gave up pick 42. How does a pick this late actually help Carlton? #NABTradeRadio
@traderadio The Aaron Francis that played the last couple of games was a revelation. Full year of that player, Daniher‚Äôs return, and I would expect they‚Äôll look a heck of a lot better. If they could land Shiel, but I feel they‚Äôre fourth in that race.

@adamgou87007269 @BK6785 @traderadio @DETVic @Adelaide_FC If true then why do you want him? He‚Äôs worth a first rounder. Not the #1, but. A first rounder. And the way Blues dealt with the Crows over Gibbs, they‚Äôll be difficult I‚Äôd think.
