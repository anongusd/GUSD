@markchironna @pst_cheahn @randyclarkga @georgianbanov It was so great to see you again. You are addicting.:-) love it. Love you!!
@brianjohnsonM That is so amazing!!
For us there are two realms: the natural and the supernatural. For God there's only one: the natural.
@Pst_cheahn @markchironna @randyclarkga @georgianbanov a great time was had by all - thanks Che

Why did Jesus raise the dead? Because not everyone dies in God's perfect timing.

Faith doesn't deny a problems existence. It denies it a place of influence.
@gywoon91 the Bible says His goodness leads us to Repentance. Not punishment.
No one has ever been punished into purity.
It's a great tragedy when the Bible is interpreted by those who are not in love.
@Keyso89 the greater the anointing the greater favor. The greater the favor the more opportunities for service. We can't respond to them all
@JennJohnson20 love you too!
Favor will sometimes open doors that are not to be walked through.
@Susie_Thomson a worship leader must worship when no one is watching. It is not a performance. It's an offering.
Evangelism in its purist form is an overflow of worship.
@TerlBryant no
If worship leaders only worship when they lead, they are not worshippers. They are mere musicians.
It's foolish to worship angels. It's equally foolish to ignore them.
Religion idolizes concepts and avoids personal experience.
The enemy lies to us to make problems appear bigger than the solutions we carry.
The walk of faith is to live according to the revelation we have received in the midst of the mysteries we can't explain.
The priority of His presence begins with thankfulness. Happy Thanksgiving!!

The Lord once woke me in the middle of the night with this statement, "HE watches over the watch of those who watch the LORD."
God never violates His word. But He's quite comfortable violating our understanding of His word.
The lack is never on His end of the equation.
The more the church finds out who she is the less she wants to be rescued.
Any area of our life for which we have no hope is under the influence of a lie.
We constantly stop short of a divine encounter by being satisfied with good theology.
God is as good as He is holy.
@KamilleRiaRazo  The kingdom means "kings domain." We are to see the realm of Gods dominion over over earthly realm inferior to heaven.
Most Christians repent enough to get forgiven, but not enough to see the kingdom.

The safest place for the believer is on the front lines of battle.
Jesus is returning for a bride whose body is in equal proportion to her head.
God defends us. And anything God won't defend isn't worth defending.
The more church realizes who she is, the less she wants to be rescued.

Never prophesy anything you're not willing to believe God for.
You have authority over any storm you can sleep in.

Law requires. Grace enables.
Don't let the "how to's" of worship distract you from the "Who to."
A stronghold is anything people trust in other than God.
(On my way to catch a plane to Korea.)
God is better than you think. So let's change the way we think.
I try to live in such a way that nothing gets bigger than my awareness of God presence on my life.
If we truly value His presence above all, we will recognize and celebrate His presence resting on another.
Jesus is the most normal Christian in the Bible.
If I can learn how to handle being wrong when I'm not, I'll not have to be wrong to learn how to handle being wrong.
