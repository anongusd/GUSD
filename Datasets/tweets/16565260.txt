@JustRichWebster Yes, that's correct.  Everyone involved in this tribute, pilots and crew, are female warriors.
LT Kelly “Ston’er” Harris, VFA-213, The Fighting Blacklions.  During her last deployment with VFA-213, Ston'er flew 25 combat missions in support of  Inherent Resolve in Iraq and Syria earning an Air Medal.  She has flown over 500 hours in the F/A-18F &amp; 100 carrier traps. https://t.co/nwloGc59Hn
LT Christy “Buzz” Talisse: "I chose Naval Aviation because I grew up watching F/A-18 Super Hornets launch out of NAS Lemoore, near my hometown. Between the jet noise and excitement I felt watching them take off, I knew I wanted to fly jets." https://t.co/cqNfWQjxGG
LT Amanda “Stalin” Lee: "I first served as an Enlisted Sailor. I'm humbled to have come full circle, and now fly the very aircraft I used to work on as a maintainer. It's because of women like Capt Mariner that "equal opportunity" won't be in our vocabulary in future generations" https://t.co/auz6lGU3vH
LT Emily “Gong” Rixey:  "I grew up with a love of all things aviation &amp; would ask my mom to take me to nearby Dulles Airport to watch planes take off and land.  In HS, my passion for flying only grew along with my desire to be a part of something bigger." https://t.co/NWktAET2li
LCDR Jennifer “Cujo” Hesling: "I knew I wanted to serve my country after watching the Twin Towers fall. This desire to serve steered me toward attending the Academy. As a Midshipman, I had the opportunity to fly in an F/A-18 Super Hornet, and I was immediately hooked." https://t.co/lGpoWMRdTu
LCDR Danielle “Purple” Thiriot: "I saw the Twin Towers fall on Sept 11, 2001 &amp; signed up a few months later. After seeing fighter squadrons in NROTC, I loved the camaraderie, professionalism, &amp; ethos of the fighter ready room. I knew I wanted to fly." https://t.co/2kgM8tcVIZ
LCDR Paige "PUFN" Blok, VFA-32: PUFN: "I told my parents my dreams of becoming a fighter pilot at age 8. I'm blessed to serve &amp; regard the pioneering women of Naval Aviation as foundational in making my dream possible. I met CAPT Rosemary Mariner; she's a beacon of leadership. https://t.co/lNwCm3k3Ir
CDR Leslie "Meat" Mintz, XO, VFA-213,  Meat: "I chose Naval Aviation because I wanted to serve amongst the finest women and men in the fleet.  The opportunity to fly jets was a lifelong dream and I knew that I wanted to fly in the most demanding and challenging environments." https://t.co/5He3xQuD3r
CDR Stacey "Stigs" Uttecht, CO, VFA-32.  Stigs:  "I've loved flying since my Dad, a pilot, would fly us around West TX.  I loved the freedom of being in the skies.

Unsafe actions increase the risk of miscalculation and potential for midair collisions. The U.S. aircraft was operating in accordance with international law and did not provoke this Russian activity.
We expect them to behave within international standards set to ensure safety and to prevent incidents, including the 1972 Agreement for the Prevention of Incidents On and Over the High Seas (INCSEA).
While the Russian military is within its right to exercise within international airspace, this interaction was irresponsible.
This interaction was determined to be unsafe due to the SU-27 conducting a high speed pass directly in front of the mission aircraft, putting at risk the pilots and crew.

This obviously predated the INCSEA (Incidents at Sea) Agreement.
Everyone who wears the Wings of Gold mourns his passing.  We stand on Harry's shoulders, and endeavor to embody the same professionalism and lethality that he did.  We excel in the air and make a difference in the world.  We are Naval Aviation!
One of the Navy's first jet pilots, Harry amassed 4,879 flight hours in props and jets, was a CAG and a CV commanding officer, decorated war hero and tactical genius.
Harry made multiple sonic boom passes that dislocated boiler bricks on the SVERDLOV, necessitating her being towed back to Sevastopol.
During a Mediterranean deployment as CO of VF-103, embarked on USS FORRESTAL’s 1964-65 deployment, Harry was directed by Commander SIXTHFLT to “remove a Soviet SVERDLOV Cruiser from the formation.”
Harry is also the only aviator in the U.S. Navy to have deliberately disabled a Soviet cruiser during the Cold War.
As CAG-7, Harry devised the tactics for the first successful strike against a North Vietnamese SA-2 surface-to-air missile site, numerous other tactical combat innovations, and led missions that destroyed key road and railroad bridges in North Vietnam.
He flew 110 missions over Vietnam, where he was awarded a Silver Star, two DFCs and 16 Air Medals.
The entire Naval Aviation family mourns the loss of RADM (Ret.) Harry Gerhard, who passed away over the weekend.  Today's Naval Aviators stand on the shoulders of the giants who preceded us, and by any standard, Harry was a true legend. (thread follows) https://t.co/rES6u0Ps1m
