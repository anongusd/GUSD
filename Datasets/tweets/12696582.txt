@lisalibrarian I think definitely the ones they'd pay OER fees for. Not sure about the rest but it could mean that as well, and if they're taking a stand it wouldn't make sense to publish in a journal your institution doesn't subscribe to.
@lisalibrarian I read this as UC not renegotiating their Elsevier contract being a "boycott".
@DavidLJarman Also safe to assume that states with decreasing population (like the Rust Belt) have higher percentages of native born.  I’d like to see this chart overlaid with population growth, although it has to be pretty much the same, because math.
Idea:		1)  We all stop paying Elsevier	2)  They go bankrupt	3)  An OER consortium buys up the assets (including article copyrights) at pennies on the dollar	4)  All the material is relicensed under a CC license.		I’m sure I’m missing something, right?

@Innerviews @Bandcamp PledgeMusic shouldn't have been that hard to do.  I keep thinking of Marillion--who literally invented crowdfunding--deciding to use Pledge for their latest album and having a less than  satisfying experience.
@Innerviews I think it’s fair to say that musicians/bands will benefit from service providers who help with things like websites and distribution, but like Bandcamp those entities should only take a basic fee or small cut at the most.

@mburtis @joefromkenyon @Autumm @ltaub @harmonygritz @BryanAlexander @CathyNDavidson @bergDLAs @floatingtim @JennaAzar @hrheingold Many faculty refuse to work with student techs.  Reasons I can think of:  Embarrassment, fear of disclosing confidential info, arrogance, generational learning differences . . .
@Autumm @CathyNDavidson @mburtis @joefromkenyon @ltaub @harmonygritz @BryanAlexander @bergDLAs @floatingtim @JennaAzar Intellectual honesty and rigor require we challenge all structures including the ones we ourselves create and perpetuate.  Even if we benefit from such structures—especially if we do.
@joefromkenyon @CathyNDavidson @mburtis @Autumm @ltaub @harmonygritz @BryanAlexander @bergDLAs @floatingtim @JennaAzar Many of my local campus colleagues don’t know that in some professional circles I might be considered quite special.

@CathyNDavidson @mburtis @joefromkenyon @Autumm @ltaub @harmonygritz @BryanAlexander @bergDLAs @floatingtim @JennaAzar And “famous” for faculty has at least three dimensions:  “Famous” in your field among your peers; “famous” overall in the world of higher ed; popular culture “famous”.

@Autumm @MorrisPelzel @joefromkenyon @harmonygritz @BryanAlexander @CathyNDavidson I'm now thinking of liberal arts schools now focusing on job skills and marketability, and not including info tech as part of that.

If I take the train earlier than my normal one, I can get to work as early as 7:15, good if I need to leave early for any reason.

My normal workday is 8-4 to optimize the return train home; but because of transit variability my usual inbound train can get me to work as early as 7:30.  That extra time can be nice, even if I just use it to start my coffee and eat breakfast. https://t.co/7xbDVjwl14

@accidentalcio We just upgraded our directory.  I hoped it would be harder to harvest addresses. I think in this weekend's case they meticulously went through it the faculty pages on our website, because the faculty got the message from the correct dean, and the directory doesn't tell you that.

@ErinAHennessy Everyone thinks Florida is such a big draw.  It's barely fun for actual vacation, it's incredibly annoying when you're expected to behave professionally in business attire when it's 85 degrees and 85 percent humidity.
So I gleefully ignore such invitations, but it's a weird system, and I guess it can be used by private organizations more freely, but still.
Not to mention the fact that my interaction with vendors is so heavily regulated that my interaction with a vendor at such an event may actually prevent them from participating in a procurement in the future with my instiitution.
And, it's super sleazy to advertise me as a draw for vendors who want to participate (and are clearly paying for the privilege) when I never agreed to participate.
There's the big issue that as a state employee I'd have to clear it with our local ethics officer and/or the state Joint Committee On Public Ethics (JCOPE).  I would probably be allowed but it would be documented fully that I did.
They were touting the speakers and people who would be at the conference.  My name was on their list, although I had never agreed to participate.
The mystery was solved for me when a friend who worked for a major IT integrator told me about the email he received about a great conference he should sponsor (he was doing marketing for the company)
What's the catch?  Who's paying for it?
For free?  Just because I'm clearly an awesome guy?  Thanks!  But wait.
One company invited me to speak at a conference shortly after I got my current job.  They would fly me all expenses paid to some exotic place like Florida, and I'd get a chance to "network with my peers."
And then there are the organizations that invite you free to a "conference" or a "dinner".

@AmyPearlman Fludmesh says they can leverage the existing PTC infrastructure, which I know NJ Transit has just installed, so maybe they can sneak it in somehow.

@scalzi I pay the mortgage, insurance, and credit card bill (in full every month), my wife gets the utilities and other miscellaneous expenses, and contributes to the college fund.  We both have our own joint accounts to manage.  We come together for overall strategy.

Then again maybe it shows that fewer people were falling for it.
Sad in a way--the first one of these I ever got actually had a stolen password from a credential breach (that had long since been changed) and a higher ransom.
And again noticing the ransoms have dropped from &gt; $5000 to this one being $800.
Of course they didn't, (wrong password!) and the headers confirmed that quickly.
And the sender address was mine, and it said "look, I sent the message from your account!"
Got my first "I know your password" exploitation message with a password that had nothing to do with any password I've ever used.

@AmyPearlman @georgekroner It is true that Microsoft spent a lot of time making sure the Office Online apps work well on a Chromebook.  And students probably don't care about using their personal Google account to log in to the computer.
@AmyPearlman @georgekroner I did a very anecdotal survey of laptops in our student center/cafeteria at lunch.  All Macs (MBP, MacBook, and MacBook Air) except for one ASUS laptop.  No Chromebooks (but we're not a Google Apps school.)
@trishak09 Interesting thought.  Our tech loan desk could rent Bluetooth keyboards.  Might be tricky to support pairing to different devices though.  You'd need keyboards that make it easy to clear pairing information between loans.
@jenneheise What's also true at my current institution is we need computers to support software that students can use but only on a University-owned machine.  Or for the once or twice a semester they need advanced software that might not run on their laptop or phone.
I'm now thinking of how to better support students who are writing course papers on their smartphone.  In our case at least making sure they know how to use the mobile version of Word and OneDrive to interface with O365.  Perhaps better alternative keyboards.
That program went away in part due to families who no longer percieved the value of the laptop, since they would just buy their student a better one anyway.  We didn't hear from people who actually needed the laptop.
I spent a long time supporting a ubiquitous computing program that gave every student a laptop, and one reason we did was to ensure equity of access.  Even (especially?) at an expensive private school.
Another thing to consider is if we're seeing differences in outcomes from students who have a basic smartphone versus ones with a more expensive high-end phone, or inexpensive laptop versus expensive one.  I don't know if the research has been done.
The ECAR study is a good starting point to interface technology offerings with overall college affordability.  And IT touches OER/zero cost textbooks, ability to finance college, and perhaps even food insecurity.  Lots to think about there @saragoldrickrab
I have lots of things to say about this.  In the most recent ECAR student survey, more students owned smartphones than laptops.   Both over 90%.  We still have to consider students without either (we have lots of labs as well of course.) https://t.co/TRH7C55V9L https://t.co/YKRuEkLQy5

Still working on how to get the word out about new services and continual input on new policy.  VC Cohen sent out message about Office 365 to 45,000 faculty and staff, open rate was about 20%.  Communication still hard with CUNY workforce, especially faculty. #cunyit18

Disheartened that women are questioned if they are “technical enough” just because of their gender. #edu18
#edu18 @cjomitch calling out sales team of 4 men in dark suits, blue ties.  When challenged, they said “product works just as well.”  Explained the optics, and said “Don’t assume you know what this institution is trying to accomplish”.
For @sppitt, inclusion means vendors bringing diverse teams to campus on sales calls.  Demanding that is important. #edu18

@theTinacity I was looking at Maps and it kept putting me in Chicago too.  Anyone else?
Great point by @rclemmons and the panel—don’t play the “comparison game”, comparing yourself to other CIOs at other institutions.  Every situation is different, every organization and every CIO.  #edu18

@RosemaryMcL I'm not saying the President is a racist.  I'm just saying the racists believe he's a racist.
@runforserenity @AmyPearlman It’s weird, but for a college president the spouse is often part of the package deal.
One of the things that happens before I go to EDUCAUSE is I start remembering the orientation and spaces of the convention center.  Inevitably each one has a nexus that if you are in you can pretty much see anyone you want to.
@EDUCAUSE_BEACON @sppitt @ITatUD Don’t you more just passively notice people as they walk by?
I’m just going to throw out into the ether that parody Twitter accounts are harder than you think they are.  And there’s a lot of luck involved.
@AmyPearlman @runforserenity At the same time it’s important to note what people generally say without being asked.  And how the expectations are different for senior level positions (I remember presidential candidates having spousal information on CV).
@runforserenity I wonder how well it's followed in the CUNY system ;-).  But when I received my diversity training the reasoning made perfect sense.

@doniamae @anildash You're on the right track--any of thse brick style mozzarellas are going to be better than pre-shredded low moisture stuff.  But I always come back to Polly-O brand, which is the brand of my childhood, and nothing else comes close.

@anildash Also, more liberals with guns would scare them into gun control too.
@anildash I'm sometimes dismayed when I think that the only way we'll get real gun control in this country is if more non-white Christians start arming themselves.
Probably the biggest accomplishement I will have today is finding where I had stored my slippers, and now wearing them on this cold, wet day.
@NateSilver538 It occurs to me we hit the limits of your modeling when there are races that are sporadically polled, and with smaller population sizes like a Congressional district.  But I think the fact you quote percentages still accounts for that.
@BadAstronomer Isn't talking about arming synagogues in fact talking about gun control as well?
@paulrcoen (Verifies that my current institution has such a requirement https://t.co/CujYd6ZQfP) I agree.
@paulrcoen I'll go a step farther and say they need more cultural anthropologists and other social scientists working for them.  And academic programs need to train people for doing that work in social media.
@armandodkos He's not seriously aruguing anything.  He's just saying whatever his addled brain is coming up with in the moment.  We need to start facing up to the thought that he has no idea what he's saying, or the consequences of it.
@TheresaRoweCIO That helps, actually. :-)
@paulrcoen @Twitter I think Twitter is worse, but I think it's fascinating watching how all of our Internet institutions are not nearly as progressive as everyone assumed, and have directly led to this specific rise of the political right.
@TheresaRoweCIO That's probably just under the threshold.  It's not a hard number, it would be more about the size, theme, and placement if you were to add more.
@eliza_c_k @educause Two small things, somewhat related:		1)  If you like a speaker, try and stay after to thank them, and perhaps exchange those business cards.		2)  If someone invites you out to dinner, especially with a group, say "yes".  I've made great connections that way.
@eliza_c_k @educause It's actually kind of cool how much we still perform the ritual of business cards at #edu18.  I think the physical artifact of an interaction is even more important these days.
@jfiske It's not.  It won't be again for as long as they've booked for. (~10 years).  And sorry to miss you in Denver, but hopefully will see you in Skaneateles in July.
@AmyPearlman They're the "Baby On Board" stickers of the 2010s.
@AmyPearlman Really just a few, mostly on the back.  Only one or two on a window max.
@AmyPearlman I mean, I get putting one or two stickers on your car, but to say, "I need a whole side of my vehicle covered in stickers that express how I feel about things.  This will not only let people understand exactly where I stand, but they will be swayed to my way of thinking"?
@AmyPearlman @blackfog @mzyw @educause I never even punched cards.  I have been there when they were loaded though.  And I've seen paper tape in use at my dad's work (FAA).  But never did either myself.
@blackfog @AmyPearlman @mzyw @educause Maybe not the 9 tracks but she may have been in the 8mm era.
It suddenly occurred to me that the bomber probably went to a Kinkos or Staples and had those stickers on his car printed.  Imagine being the person who had to pull them off the printer.

@blackfog Also very true.  We need to understand there are multiple factors with these sorts of things, and acknowledge them all.
@mattyglesias Certainly not as effective as fearmongering.
@blackfog That's an aspect of this, though.  Sane people don't do this stuff regardless of politics.
@mzyw @educause Although I did not own a computer with 8" floppies, I used computers with them.
@scalzi I also carry a multi-outlet tap, so if I need to plug in I can share (or ask someone to share the plug they're using.)
@AmyPearlman @mzyw @educause  Techically, yes; but I think it's important to note that it was by writing on them, not punching them.  I forget if you were there to change the 9-track tapes for backing up the VAX.
@mattyglesias A Republican presidential candidate in 2020 or 2024 will say that if we vote for a Democrat there will be falafel trucks on every corner.
Can we put aside politics and ideology for a while, and talk about the fact that people with stickers all over their cars are a bit nuts?
@BobMahar That's awesome, it's like a toddler sorting shapes toy.
@mcmansionhell At least he didn't suggest you spend half the time at straight support groups and half at lesbian support groups?
@BobMahar But seriously, what was the solution?
@BobMahar I forgot: Deflate the spool.
@BobMahar You don't look like you're definitely *not* made of spools.
@AmyPearlman I thought that—and I called them when they said they’d be “replacing the band”, saying was having other issues.  They assured me they diagnosed the problem accurately, and verified the 90-day warranty.  The band houses the radio antennae, so it may have caused other issues.
@BobMahar Or:  Get a smaller spool, wheel it through the door, and then unroll the innerduct from one spool to the other.
@BobMahar 1) Put a rod through the center of the spool.	2) Tie a reciprocating saw to a line about 6 inches shorter than the current radius of the spool.	3)  Cut 6" off the radius of the spool.
It starts up without having to be on the cradle.  It's not spontaneously dying.  I'm even leaving all day heart rate monitoring on.  The experience is basically what it's supposed to be, although @vzwsupport is still not supporting voice or messages over LTE.
PS:  So I sent in my LG watch for repair, and they charged me $50 to replace the band.  Thing it's it's like a brand new watch.  This is probably also due to the Android Wear update, but I'm getting more than full day battery life, and everything works better.

@AmyPearlman @kyleejohnson Wednesday might work.  I might have at least one other dinner to attend, but I can time that.
@kyleejohnson @AmyPearlman That sounds completely awesome.  I’m relatively open at the moment but I know I have some stuff to fill in.
@AmyPearlman You've got this.
@jacoh55 @DialecticObser1 @doctorow The only tail fins better than the 1959 Impala fins were the 1959 Cadillac fins.
@BobMahar To be fair, one of the things I like about you is that you apparently don't self-edit.  But I'm mostly talking about the things that are not mine to say.
@DrJenGunter "Winter Vagina Time" is the name of my banjo-playing L7 cover band.
@doctorow And so it was, until we got rid of the car a few months later.  (I think we gave it to a mechanic.)
@doctorow My mom looked at the mug, looked at me, and calmly said, "Alice is the name of my car."
@doctorow I, being a brash preteen, immediately pointed out to Mom that she in fact bought a mug named for someone else!
@doctorow Anyway, she had brought this mug home, and didn't look all around it.   On the other side, you could see that it was a personalized mug, and that it was personalized for "Alice".		That was not my mom's name.
@doctorow I can still smell the mix of sugary coffee, lipstick and cigarette smoke, and remember the mug with cigarette burns on it.
@doctorow One day, she went to the store, and saw a bin of plastic coffee mugs--the ones that were double-walled and had a printed insert in them, and the outside layer clear, so you could see the image.  It was a pretty, brightly colored, geometric floral pattern.
@doctorow They got it for like $300, the upholstery was ripped, it smelled musty, and the transmission sounded like it had bowling balls rattling in it.  It would stop running while it was moving, and my mom had to shift into neutral and restart it, while still in motion.
@doctorow Let me tell you a story.  When I was a kid, my family bought a 1963 Impala as a second car for my mom.  This was 1979, so it was already an old car.
@AmyPearlman @EpcotCentre @LosFelizDaycare @RikerGoogling I'll also add @USCPSC.
@AmyPearlman @EDUCAUSE_HULK All three of us?
@AmyPearlman For a serious answer @saragoldrickrab makes me feel like we can make the world a better place.
@AmyPearlman I'd have to say @EpcotCentre, @LosFelizDaycare, and @RikerGoogling .
But I assume it's like that for everyone, like how you wouldn't want to see anyone's unedited stream of their thoughts.
Sometimes I think about the Twitter that's all the things I can't put on Twitter and how amazing it would be.  I can't even do it anonymously though.  Way too easy to figure out and is get in a lot of trouble.

It may be that what we all value is pretty important to salvage, and most of what we actually argue about isn't.
Let's have real converations about real things.  Ask your friends and family what they truly value.  Ask them if the politicians they support truly represent those values.  Ask what they value in YOU if you disagree with them.
I wish I had better insight on how to deal with that.  But this ideological parroting that goes on in social media isn't helping.  Yeah, the memes I agree with are funny, but they don't change anyone's mind; or increase anyone's understanding as much as is needed.
We can talk at length about how deeply ill-informed that viewpoint actually is; fueled by Fox News et. al; but it doesn't matter--the fear is real.  If we don't address the fear we can't begin to solve the problem.
This is the key issue of our time.  Appointing Kavanaugh to the court to roll back Roe V. Wade is not just about abortion, it's about the belief that "traditional institutions" have been "undermined" by liberal philosophies.
This will require fundamentally reshaping many of our institutions; and this is exactly what Trump and the Rs who voted for him are scared about, and fighting against.  And they are being cruel and reactionary.
We've got to stop looking at people like Kavanaugh as merely individuals making decisions; and recognize our societal structures perpetuate values and ideas that we're now saying are unacceptable; and figure out how to reshape those structures to promote what we truly value.
(And yes, I realize that there's an alternate me who did both.)
Part of my relief is that if I had gone to a school with fraternities, and I had joined one, I might have become someone who present-day me wouldn't have liked very much.  Sort of like the alternate history where I read Ayn Rand in college and took it seriously.
I know, your fraternity/sorority wasn't like that; you made lifelong friends; there are good aspects to Greek life.  But there's also many, many Brett Kavanaughs.
I gotta say the whole Kavanaugh confirmation process is reminding me about how glad I am that I went to a school without a Greek system.

@10GM My personal phone is a Galaxy S9. Not interested in replacing it at the moment.  Apple is dominating the smartwatch market though, and it seems to be the better product overall.
The thing is I really like having a smartwatch for fitness, notifications, and general gadget happiness. I've been at this for 3 years though and haven't found the ideal.  It's all compromise.  Half tempted to get a Garmin Fenix instead, but it's different compromises. /end

If you ran websites that way, you probably wouldn't be doing it for the largest capitalized company in the world.
In 2018 any modern website should have full redundancy, and a dev/stage environment where all changes should be tested thoroughly and then pushed to production instantly with no downtime.
Does anyone actually believe that Apple really needs to bring down its store website for several hours to make changes to sell new devices when they come out?  If so, why are you trusting them with anything?

@TheresaRoweCIO @accidentalcio My thoughts on this issue are complex and probably internally contradictory, so I may have to do a blog post to sort them out.  I had a recent incident which suggest this transition may take longer than 10 years to affect (which is fine for me in terms of retirement horizon ;-0)
@accidentalcio @TheresaRoweCIO Another way would be specialized think tanks (Gartner-like, or other strategic higher ed consultants) that cabinets rely on for specific strategic knowledge.  I’m not nuts about that for obvious reasons (although hopefully they’d have a job for me.)
@accidentalcio @TheresaRoweCIO I don’t think that strategic IT knowledge trickles down to the average IT using students of the last 10 years.  We still need specialists who understand the technology and its impacts guiding the organization. Cabinet position is one way to do it.
@_bgardner @landryst “Hey, I hear you don’t like deez holes I’m diggin’ in your yard.  I could make sure they don’t get dug no more for a reasonable monthly retainer!"
@TheresaRoweCIO @accidentalcio I think that’s an uncommon organization (and I have opinions on a cabinet being anything other than direct reports to the President).  Either way it’s awkward (and you’ve certainly discussed the challenges it brings.)
@accidentalcio Then again, if CIO is not a cabinet level position it’s already being subsumed by the VP that it reports to (usually either academic or financial), which means it’s considered one of those functions, not a unit of its own.
@TheresaRoweCIO @accidentalcio Think about when you hear a non-CIO cabinet member talk about not understanding technology and how  technology issues are unimportant or someone else’s problem.
@accidentalcio In some ways your argument could be applied, say, to enrollment management—its functions could be split amongst the academic administration, faculty, and the financial office.  Yet nearly everyone now has enrollment management as a dedicated VP.
@accidentalcio And now I’m going to take the contrarian view that IT functions are so fundamental to the enterprise, and so orthogonal to what other senior executives do, that a cabinet-level CIO position is the only way to ensure that IT functions are adequately supported across the enterprise
This is really important.  I left a place I love after 23 years, and even though nearly everything about my new place is better for me and my career, I have sadness for what I left behind, and what is no longer there. https://t.co/ofJrR7FjF2

@paulkrugman Can we throw in plain old sexism and misogyny?
@MechanicJay @jbreams That’s what I’m trying to get at.  If a platform preference is actually a symptom of inflexibility, it may be a bad thing.  If it’s just what they’re used to; fine.  If it’s a rational decision based on evidence; great!
@jbreams ’ve approved expenses and uses of technology that my predecessors would never have permitted, largely because I could see the value proposition.  Even in a finite (and shrinking) budget the money involved is small. I do ask to do things as cost-effectively as possible though.
@jbreams The rate we paid for that hotel was closer to the latter number.
@jbreams If someone says “I’m most comfortable with a Mac and I’d prefer it” then no problem (and yes, I fully support and buy them for faculty and staff).  I’m rebelling against the idea that people can remain ignorant about IT concepts and tools and the workplace thinks it’s OK.
@jbreams Unfortunately there can be a difference between a private organization who can easily pin expenses to a return on investment, and a state organization whose expenditures are looked at as taxpayer money spent (like paying for IT executives to go to a conference ;-)
@jbreams It’s been a long time since I’ve met a FreeBSD user who couldn’t also navigate their way around Windows or MacOS well. It’s the self-identification to the point of exclusion that may show an unwillingness to adapt that is incompatible with modern enterprises.
@jbreams I don’t disagree, the amount of money to get someone their preferred technology might only be $100-200 a year. It especially works if people who don’t care are willing to accept lower cost options. But people aren’t serving themselves by celebrating their refusal to learn things.

@jbreams @paulrcoen @runstaverun Remember if 113F refers to the ambient temperature outside the switch, internal components will be hotter. CPUs will usually shut down between 70-100C.
@runstaverun @paulrcoen The new switches we're getting have 1100W power supplies--thermal dissipation is about 4300 BTU/hr (thank you for using correct units!)  But that's at max load, I'd be surprised if we hit 1/3 of that.
@paulrcoen @runstaverun Right.  I think Cisco has a similar deal nowadays (have to check) but they could choose not to honor if I deliberately go out of spec.  113 is pretty hot though.
@BobMahar Is there year-round chilled air that can be delivered to the vent?  That's a nice solution either way, and doable in several of our buildings at least.
@runstaverun @paulrcoen I guess it's a question of if you really believe a vendor certification.  The max temp should mean the same MTBF as the minimum temperature.
@paulrcoen Looks like 45 deg C.

How many years of medical data are we talking about here?  What the heck is in it?  I honestly would give a 72 year old American Male a lot of slack here.  Even the President.
I mean,  he doesn't seem like the type that listens to doctor's orders.   Why go and let him do real medical tests if you're just going to have him dictate a letter anyway?
Here's the question:  Why did Trump even bother to let his doctor have real health data about him that wasn't what he wanted to get out?
@yesthattom You're the best man!	You're the best, man!	You're the best! Maaaaan.	*You're* the best man?		#IntonationMatters
And the escalating messages are the "Can you tell me who is in charge of . . ." kind.  There's no way I'd rat the person they're looking for out, even if I didn't like them. (Besides, if it were a real person sending the message a Google search would provide the answer.)
Also, I seem to be getting an increase in LinkedIn connection requests from salespeople as cold calls. I have connected with salespeople I work with regularly, but I won’t with ones I don’t have a prior relationship with (probably can’t without disclosing it to JCOPE),
Anyone have any insight on how the idea that an escalating series of desperate emails from salespeople who you don’t reply to and don’t have easy unsubscribe links in their messages got promulgated? I feel like it must be some software or training telling people to do that.

@ScottJaschik If the school is covering costs and doing okay there's no issue.  Discounted tuition should reflect market pricing for an education.  Problem is when schools have to discount more than what they need to cover costs.  Pricing and discounts are irrelevant next to net revenue.

@sharonblanton @kaiyen @ass_deans Right now e-sports is not monitored by the NCAA so in theory an e-sports program could grant scholarships at a Division III school.  That’s actually an issue to me, because it isn’t equitable.  But e-sports scholarships are currently much smaller than NCAA ones.
@sharonblanton @kaiyen @ass_deans Personally, I think it’s an equity and access issue.  If scholar-athletes are eligible for scholarships and sports deliver revenue, e-sports athletes should be treated the same way.

@kaiyen @AmyPearlman @mzyw @rclemmons @Keith_McIntosh @kyleejohnson @sppitt @sherriyz @OUCIO @jcycio An actual sub-argument here is if the CIO is reporting to the Provost, CFO, or dual/dotted-line arrangements to both, and what that means.
@AmyPearlman @kaiyen @mzyw @rclemmons @Keith_McIntosh @kyleejohnson @sppitt @sherriyz @OUCIO @jcycio And while a non-cabinet CIO may be able to use advocate for their positions to their (presumably cabinet-level) superior, it will always be different than being in the room.  Please also note being on cabinet is not necessarily a direct report to President.
@AmyPearlman @kaiyen @mzyw @rclemmons @Keith_McIntosh @kyleejohnson @sppitt @sherriyz @OUCIO @jcycio I think @kaiyen is mostly right, except there are places where structure and hierarchy matter more than they should, and CIO reporting may be the only way to get IT at the table.

@AmyPearlman Most of my learning is those sort of encapsulated vignettes.  Usually that's great, except for information that doesn't actually work in that format.
@AmyPearlman @paulrcoen @ghelleks And I don't remember having an actual conversation about most of this with you, so surely you also picked it up with your own intution if you in fact learned it from me.
@AmyPearlman @paulrcoen @ghelleks When I actually need a salesperson they are going to work very hard for me, and I will appreciate their effort.
@AmyPearlman @paulrcoen @ghelleks It's just basic common sense to me.  If I actually spent all the time with salespeople that they wanted me to, there'd be literally no time for anything else (even working overtime) and in my new job I'd likely be violating our ethics regulations.

@AmyPearlman @saragoldrickrab I always managed to be able to buy food over the summers, but it was very lean sometimes.  Baruch students have a grab and go on campus, or NYC restaurants (some cheap options nearby, but still $5-10 minimum). There is always a line at the microwaves though.
@AmyPearlman It's good.  We had started plans for a food pantry at Baruch before this announcement.  I also knowh @saragoldrickrab is providing her perspective, which makes me think we'll do it right.  Probably less food insecurity at residential colleges (assuming meal plan mandatory.)

@BryanAlexander @AmyPearlman @blackfog @Keith_McIntosh @kyleejohnson @_bgardner @shanodine A huge advantage for cash-strapped institutions.  If the point of a conference experience is to catalyze work, I think the advantages of unconferences are obvious:  direct participation, very low cost, often local, easy to participate before and after online.
@BryanAlexander @blackfog @AmyPearlman @Keith_McIntosh @kyleejohnson @_bgardner @shanodine @cni_org We’re likely bringing back 30 minute breaks for #nyscio—the biggest feedback was that losing those breaks reduced the value of the conference.
@BryanAlexander @AmyPearlman @blackfog @Keith_McIntosh @kyleejohnson @_bgardner @shanodine I assume that corporate sponsorship of conferences only helps run the event and is not a revenue center; if so unconferences are a low or zero-cost add-on that provides benefit.
@blackfog @BryanAlexander @AmyPearlman @Keith_McIntosh @kyleejohnson @_bgardner @shanodine This is also the definition of the "unconference" movement where the sessions themselves are what is the hallway track at other conferences.
@accidentalcio Well, yeah.  I do turn off "Hey Siri" and "OK Google" detection though, but I know I could get hacked.
@AmyPearlman @BobMahar You don't, and presumably they encrypt it too.  But it would be interesting to see how much data gets transmitted, and when.  Certainly someone's done this already?
@kyleejohnson @llorenzin I think you're supposed to turn off "yak mode".
So the #CDC just needs to map the #CDC7words to the Carlin seven words and start using them instead.
@BobMahar It would be easy to add a remote to Alexa/Google Home that doesn't turn on the mic until you click it.  Of course, you're still trusting them not to leave it on anyway. I guess combine that with a firewall that only lets it send data when you've hit the button.

@AmyPearlman @accidentalcio I meant it in the narrow sense that program committee had sessions for their own use. Not that the whole process was a hack.
@AmyPearlman @accidentalcio Another hack is to get on program committee ;-).  But you probably have to present first.
@accidentalcio @AmyPearlman Exception being known speakers,  and that's one reason why you see good ones year after year.
@accidentalcio @AmyPearlman There's still not nearly enough correlation with quality of proposal vs. quality of presentation.  Committee can only judge former though.

I will staunchly defend the skills of liberal arts majors in technology; he tenets of a liberal arts education &gt;&gt; mere technical skills.
So, to summarize, well-trained students, with liberal arts sensibilities, exposed to tech at just the right time and in the right way.
And that ethos remained when @clarkesworld took over the Aide Station near the end of my student days, and into my full-time status.
That was behavior I liearned by basically having students run the Aide Station for a year without adult supervision when I was a student.
@blackfog We then gave those students a probably somewhat reckless amount of responsibility and autonomy.
@blackfog We hired not as much for technical skill (can be acquired) as much as personal skills and analytical prowess (harder to develop).
@blackfog We had a pool of people who were comfortable exploring technology, and had liberal arts critical thinking and information management skills
As @blackfog suggested, from about 1984-2004 or so the CI did its job, getting liberal arts majors using tech effectively.
A lot of factors.  Here we go: https://t.co/H0X4c4Rn4S

@_bgardner @AmyPearlman @soupkills Maybe, maybe not.  I'm confident they've run the numbers and have made it work.
@AmyPearlman @soupkills @_bgardner Maybe some students’ net cost goes up in fact, because they will be less sensitive to total cost with overall lower published tuition.
@AmyPearlman @soupkills @_bgardner It would be interesting to see the financial aid formulas, but surely I don’t have access to them.
@AmyPearlman @soupkills @_bgardner In terms of student debt, there is this: https://t.co/Ub7EFGPR59  I do know of at least one person with six figures of debt after Drew tho.

@AmyPearlman @_bgardner Much of that drop was additional endowment spend beyond the operational deficit for capital projects like the Commons renovation.

@AmyPearlman @_bgardner The endowment can fund operational deficits for at least another decade.
@AmyPearlman @_bgardner I just had the thought that if it does work they can probably raise tuition aggressively to bring the list price back to market.
@AmyPearlman @_bgardner I think there's still a few more levers to pull if it doesn't work.
@AmyPearlman @_bgardner The situation is not yet dire but it is worth that kind of risk, in that doing nothing has a higher risk of failure.
@_bgardner @AmyPearlman I don't think any other small liberal arts schools that are threatened are responding as comprehensively, and positively.
@AmyPearlman @_bgardner Still better than sticking their head in the sand.  The new administration is not shying away from the threat.
@_bgardner @AmyPearlman Mostly that.  And a publicity boost along with the US News rankings (they did well in the "Best Value Schools" list, with old tuition)
@AmyPearlman @_bgardner Short take: a more realistic assessment of the market value of Drew at the moment.  Won't affect net tuition per student, but more students?

@BobMahar If I had that power if be using it differently.
@BobMahar So you’re saying you didn’t have a flag at all before this one showed up on the floor?
@BobMahar It was not me.  And you know what to do.
@BobMahar Indeed. Here's a good article about the ambiguity of the Flag Code: https://t.co/j8RY6Ktaue. Ultimately there's no enforcement anyway.
Threw caution to the wind and bought my September train pass to NY Penn.  I figure at this point they’ll have to honor it irregardless.
@BobMahar It's 176 (j) that I believe is relevant here.
@BobMahar I don't think I've seen a campaign use the flag this way before, but I can't be sure.
@BobMahar Pins are ok, lapel over the heart.
@BobMahar There are restrictions on who gets to use a patch on clothing.  Military, law enforcement, and "patriotic organizations".  Not campaigns.
@kyleejohnson In a way, all of them.
@JohnStevenSaul We're not the UK where you can do whatever you want with the Union Jack.  We have rules, imposed by conservatives who then ignore them.
@JohnStevenSaul Yes, if it contains actual, full flags. Most are careful not to.
And don't stick one on the fender of your car, and never drape it on ANYTHING other than the casket of a soldier or leader.
Still, no one should be surprised that the President doesn't know or care to follow the simple rules of the Flag Code.
He has not yet done so.  I suppose the way things are now, a Tweet would count.
Of course, the President can modify the Flag Code at any time, but he must do so by "proclamation". https://t.co/6h2HbwMHyz
And, don't fly it at night unless it's lighted, and don't fly it in inclement weather.

@kayakpete @yesofficial I mean I have my issues with the Hall, but Yes meets their criteria, Jann Wenner's disdain for prog rock notwithstanding.
It's worth mentioning that I'm very happy that @yesofficial is going to be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  They deserve it.
@saragoldrickrab The socioeconomic themes in @MarillionOnline's "F*** Everyone and Run" are congruent with your interests.  (Warning: obsessive fan of band.)

If we build a wall instead of infrastructure we're a dumb country and deserve the economic collapse paralleling our infrastructure collapse.
All it takes in infrastructure spending, putting people to work, raising property values, improving businesses.  Money well spent.
Lots of tunnels, lots of tracks, more stairways and escalators, redundant failsafes, redundant systems.
I mean, we could be in sleek, fast trains with regenerative braking, and my commute could be well under 30 minutes.
It occurs to me that I probably have lowered my expectations too much on the commuter experience. #njtransit

@tomtomorrow Let's just say I'm glad they let you stay in the country.
@ttamaton That's fine, and not unfair.  There's a lot of work to do, and it needs to be done better than it has been.

@ttamaton Well, no.  Just to act like they give a crap, a lot, all the time.  So run a better campaign, perhaps.
I want every Democrat in Congress to act like they're running for president in 2020.
