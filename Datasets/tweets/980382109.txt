Happiness consists of three things: someone to love, work to do, and a clear conscience.
Only the calm, outside downtown will not distort and impetuous, to listen to the inner voice.
Remember that life is full of ups and downs, and without the downs, the ups would mean nothing
More easy to get less attention, cherish. This is life.
The purpose of life is to enjoy every moment
Never frown，even when you are sad，because you never know who is falling in love with your smile
Make up your mind to act decidedly and take the consequences. No good is ever done in this world by hesitation.
Keep smiling, because life is a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about.
The greatest gift you can give someone is your time, your attention, your love, your concern.
Life without love like a tree without blossom or fruit
