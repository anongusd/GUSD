My office has now helped more than 10,000 people right here in Sacramento County – including nearly 2,500 veterans and servicemembers. 9/
As a doctor who has helped care for veterans, I know how much our vets sacrifice for our country – it’s so important to support these heroes. 8/
It turned out that while Sal was approved for his back pay, the VA had never actually sent his benefits. 		My office contacted the VA to expedite Sal’s benefits and the situation was resolved within a month. 7/
As the bills mounted, Sal contacted my office to help with his VA disability claim – we got right to work. 6/
During his second treatment period, the VA had not yet provided Sal with his back-pay benefits, adding to his stress. 5/
Unfortunately, Sal later received tests that his cancer had returned. It was a very stressful time for Sal and his finances. 4/
He decided to use his Department of Veterans Affairs benefits to pay for his medicine and started responding positively to treatment. 3/
Sal was diagnosed with prostate cancer related to his exposure to Agent Orange. 2/

That’s when he contacted my office for help.  4/

Rob asked my office that when we shared his story, that we share his advice: “Don’t be afraid to call your representative for help – Stick to the facts and they will do everything they can.” 9/
Within a few weeks, we were able to help Rob and his wife get a Medicare exemption so their policy could be reinstated. 8/
Then Rob called my office, and my staff got to work. 7/
They worried that they’d have to pay for their medications with credit cards, piling up debts that’d place their whole retirement in jeopardy. 6/
They were told their insurance policy could not be reinstated, and that they’d have to wait several months to get their coverage back. 5/
But then Rob and his wife received a cancellation notice. It turned out his insurance company was checking the wrong account all along, and his automatic payments had been turned off. 4/
He called his insurance agent repeatedly, and was assured he’d paid in full. 3/
They paid for a private insurance plan to supplement their Medicare coverage. But Rob began to receive notices from his insurance company claiming that he owed them money, even though he had set up automatic payments. 2/

Women seeking answers about their health should be able to receive accurate, unbiased medical information and counseling. I am very disappointed with the Supreme Court decision today blocking the California law that requires pregnancy centers to more fully disclose what they are.

It’s wrong to deny hardworking women the chance to earn a decent living for their families. That’s why I’m supporting the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act to stamp out gender discrimination in the workplace. https://t.co/bx3opVxhaZ
It’s outrageous the Trump Administration is trying to gut protections for preexisting conditions. Instead of sabotaging health care, we need to work with both parties to fix what isn’t working – not kick millions off their health insurance. https://t.co/QhxoRKjeaT
DACA has helped hundreds of thousands of young immigrants since it was announced six years ago today. It’s time for President Trump to stop playing politics with their lives. We must pass the DREAM Act to protect hardworking young people who call the United States home. https://t.co/UowXKDpeme

It turned out that while Sal was approved for his back-pay, the VA had never actually sent his benefits. My office contacted the VA to expedite Sal’s benefits and the situation was resolved within a month. 5/
As the bills mounted, Sal contacted my office to help with his VA disability claim – we got right to work. 4/
Unfortunately, Sal later received tests that his cancer had returned. It was a very stressful time for Sal and his finances. During his second treatment period, the VA had not yet provided Sal with his back-pay benefits, adding to his stress. 3/
Sal was diagnosed with prostate cancer related to his exposure to Agent Orange. He decided to use his Department of Veterans Affairs benefits to pay for his medicine and started responding positively to treatment. 2/

Proud to push for real improvements to the #ACA to make it work for American families #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/sgKF0yGZEo
These are common sense ideas to make the Affordable Care Act work better for American families – ideas that both parties should support.
Health care is about putting the patient’s health first. We must reduce costs &amp; increase those insured - that's exactly what these plans do
Make smart changes: align open enrollment w/ tax season. Draw bidding areas to help rural America #ProtectOurCare
Create affordable options: provide premium support by age &amp; geography. Create more options for older Americans #ProtectOurCare
Promote enrollment: In #CA, markets are stable b/c more folks are enrolled. This expands the pool &amp; reduces costs #ProtectOurCare
Keep costs down for lower income families: guarantee cost sharing reduction payments. These reduce copays &amp; deductibles #ProtectOurCare
Protect people with pre-existing conditions: create dedicated reinsurance fund to control premiums #ProtectOurCare
Here are FIVE ideas to improve the #ACA that stabilize and improve the marketplace #ProtectOurCare
It’s time we put people before politics and improve the #ACA. We must work across party lines to support working families #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/uxRPFcgZnn

I want to extend my sincere thanks to Ranking Member @RepEliotEngel for his leadership on this issue as well all @HFACDemocrats. 11/ END
We must stay true to that tradition. Abandoning U.S. leadership threatens our own security. 10/
For nearly 70 years, Republican and Democratic Presidents have understood importance of diplomacy and development to our security. 9/
That’s why I’m leading an effort along with all of my Democratic colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee to push back. 8/ https://t.co/jVtWz72VSh
Experts warn at such low funding levels, instead of leading, the US will fail to meet the great international challenges of our time. 7/
That includes programs that limit the spread of terrorism and deadly diseases. 6/
The President’s budget plan for the State Department calls for an UNPRECEDENTED 32% cut to the international affairs budget. 5/
But President Trump’s budget plan threatens America’s leadership on these issues – and would end up making us less safe. 4/
Even as we recognize that we cannot, and should not, address those challenges alone. 3/
Dealing with these challenges requires active American leadership and involvement in world affairs. 2/
