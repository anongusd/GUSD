@TheDemocrats I tried to do a positive spin for your tweet, @TheDemocrats, but what is #ABetterDeal than @realDonaldTrump's. Where’s your plan?
Americans want change. @TheDemocrats ran on a platform to maintain the status quo. We don't just want #ABetterDeal. We want the best deal.
An effective way for @TheDemocrats to obstruct @realDonaldTrump: propose policy after policy that is better than anything @GOP has to offer.
RT @david_tanenhaus: My favorite Civil War era monuments are the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments.
No, @realDonaldTrump, the statues are not ripping us apart. Nazis and your words are. Stand strongly &amp; firmly against them. #Charlottesville https://t.co/6OCDWKLtad
Why is @LindseyGrahamSC giving @realDonaldTrump a pat on the back for being 3 days late &amp; only after he got criticism? #Charlotesville https://t.co/Od8jdLUXn8
“I have decided to love.” – Martin Luther King Jr., 1967. #Charlottesville https://t.co/sYgErSTTQN
RT @JoeBiden: There is only one side. #charlottesville
THIS is how you do positive messaging. @TheDemocrats - take notes. Excellent ad, @AmyMcGrathKY. #Kentucky deserves a Rep like you! https://t.co/YHmgymE0Mj
Sen @JeffFlake, yes, @GOP has a @realDonaldTrump problem. If "someone should do something" &amp; that someone is you, what are you going to do? https://t.co/BTohuj71aA
We don't want to destroy the people of #NorthKorea. Just the Kim regime &amp; WMDs. The rest are innocent. @LindseyGrahamSC needs to reevaluate. https://t.co/Z3NfGWbKMF
Too many Americans had no access to insurance before #ACA. 6.5M may not want it, but millions more didn't want it taken away. 17% approval. https://t.co/JnIm59CNtt
Corporations pay too little tax $. REAL #TaxReform = cuts for middle class &amp; no loopholes for corps and wealthy, @TheDemocrats @GOP.
Wow, @JeffFlake stood up &amp; put #countrybeforeparty. Now what policy will you put forth? @TheDemocrats are ready for #checksandbalances. https://t.co/p4vpM1hRHt
If taxpayers are funding the research, we should get the benefits. @TheDemocrats @GOP should vote w/ @SenSanders against #CronyCapitalism. https://t.co/DZx767mgG7
Hey @GOP, how about you investigate people who are currently in government?Better yet, put our tax $ in things like #infrastructure instead. https://t.co/o4DdqMYGRv
Not only must we fight to protect these programs, but we must fight to expand them. We need #MedicareForAll. @GOP @TheDemocrats https://t.co/P9vLUmM2Gu
Here’s my #PositiveProofreading spin of @Lawrence’s tweet: https://t.co/uZnhGvM9ge
Glad we get to keep this legislation that helped millions of Americans! Next step: #MedicareForAll @TheDemocrats @GOP @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/14JvDJFEbX
@SenFranken @maddow As much as I like @maddow, we're in dire need of reaching conservatives. You're preaching to the choir. Go on @FoxNews to #SaveACA.
Americans deserve far better than all of the @GOP plans, @SenateMajLdr. #ACA is a start to #MedicareForAll, which is what we truly need. https://t.co/8gt9piiyta
RT @SenFranken: It’s National Housing Week of Action, and we should be making affordable housing more accessible for everyone. #OurHomesOur…
This decision is the disruption we did not need. #TransBan does not make us safer, @realDonaldTrump. We are grateful for all who serve. https://t.co/BiMaF04nRQ
Who is this "we" worshiping God? Americans don't have to worship anything. We have freedom from gov establishing religion. @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/quySrOEW4r
Hey @ChrisMurphyCT @SenFranken @SenWarren. Stop going on @MSNBC to talk #ACArepeal and go on @FoxNews where they need to hear your message.
Hey @TheDemocrats, why am I seeing you all on @MSNBC talking #ACArepeal? You're preaching to the choir. Go on @FoxNews!
We deserve a new direction, but it is the opposite direction from which @GOP wishes to proceed. #SaveACA, then we want #MedicareForAll. https://t.co/X0sMbWajZY
Listen, @GOP: Insurance exists to protect the sick, &amp; #PreexistingCondition costs in #AHCA #BCRA are unquestionably more harmful than #ACA.
Today, @GOP must answer to voters: will they listen to the vast majority of us who say #AHCA #BCRA are not the "relief" we want? #FixACA https://t.co/fBkv7MaSSO
Don't #RepealAndReplace #ACA. @GOP needs to put sick people above insurance &amp; pharma profits and make fixes to lower costs &amp; premiums.
Sens and Reps from @GOP aren't elected to protect you, @realDonaldTrump. Strong, ethical leaders wouldn't need their protection anyways. https://t.co/mYs28BD9bX
We will not stand for #Repeal17. We want direct election of senators. Why promote #StatesRights over #FreeElections? https://t.co/XYAbgZzY4Y
They're making long-term investments that will lower devastating costs of #GlobalWarming in the future. #ParisAccord was a smart investment. https://t.co/mjrUse7zId
Here’s my #PositiveProofreading spin of @TheDemocrats’s tweet: https://t.co/NwFHJFySjQ
Thank you, @RepAdamSchiff, for committing to #CampaignFinanceReform. All @TheDemocrats &amp; @GOP should join you to overturn #CitizensUnited. https://t.co/gtYhtGdtyN
Here’s my #PositiveProofreading spin of @RepLloydDoggett’s tweet: https://t.co/t3JUkglypz
Poll shows midterm preference for @TheDemocrats, but without anti-Trump motivation. #Positive #Policy talk wins. https://t.co/XN7Z5VHfES
Here’s my #PositiveProofreading spin of @JoyAnnReid’s tweet: https://t.co/MT0XXjOLww
Thank you, @SenCapito, for sticking up for West Virginians and the country. We want legislators who are there to help, not hurt. #Healthcare https://t.co/c6F4aaHKTd
If it's 'perfectly normal,' why didn't @WhiteHouse announce it? @realDonaldTrump should refrain from meeting with #Kremlin officials. https://t.co/rgDWv6lbva
#ACA is not a mistake, but it does need fixing. Congress was elected to represent Americans. We need a #PublicOption, not #AHCA or #BCRA. https://t.co/CAgydiWSJ6
Thank you, @SenJeffMerkley, for highlighting stories of your constituents &amp; working to protect their #Healthcare coverage. #SaveMedicaid https://t.co/QP88ZEGn98
Thank you, @TomOHalleran, for putting forth legislation to increase accountability in #Congress. Americans appreciate Reps who work for us! https://t.co/kpVhnBv6pk
Politicians will do anything to win. Patriots will do anything to serve their country. Which are you, @realDonaldTrump &amp; @DonaldJTrumpJr? https://t.co/PoqCKpGick
Thank you, @SenatorHeitkamp, for meeting with psychology professionals @APA to work on quality #MentalHealth solutions. https://t.co/OOBfy8E2zf
"It's the right thing to do." Thank you, @SenFranken, for taking tribal communities into account in the #healthcare debate. #ACA #AHCA #BCRA https://t.co/kL7mJoGnP2
I wish @realDonaldTrump would contribute constructive fixes rather than letting US #healthcare fail. One #ACA fix: add a #PublicOption. https://t.co/AC5mWOvOKP
Thank you, @SenatorCollins, for your vote for #PeopleOverParty and #PeopleOverProfits. Let’s make #bipartisan fixes to #ACA &amp; #healthcare. https://t.co/hbYXr5C5jX
Here’s my #PositiveProofreading spin of @MaxineWaters’s messaging: https://t.co/7Qo5eCDT3R
I wish @SenateGOP would give more $$ for #opioidcrisis. It's more important than the $54B increase @realDonaldTrump wants for military. https://t.co/l5ftyShB9W
I wish you held yourself to the same standards you want @TheDemocrats to adhere to, @SenateMajLdr. @POTUS44's #SCOTUS seat deserved a vote. https://t.co/nEeQTTnChf
This is the right way to frame @TheDemocrats #Healthcare message. Highlight the people who inspire your work. Nice job, @SenKamalaHarris! https://t.co/fxx4HY8NeS
We need an #EverySeatStrategy down the whole ballot. @TheDemocrats should not leave anyone out in the fray. #PartyOfThePeople https://t.co/U2ybSlSv5G
It's great that @SenWarren thanks her constituents for sharing their concerns @ her #TownHall. This is what patriots do and partisans avoid. https://t.co/unSLoSX3DK
Great to see support for job training programs for the new economy. @TheDemocrats: continue encouraging businesses that take these steps. https://t.co/2JsmAfbvHa
This is a positive plan. @TheDemocrats as a party should promote legislation that protects the vulnerable and cuts costs. #ACA #AHCA #BCRA https://t.co/yY3JHQHnOm
The people have spoken, and #ACA is preferred. Calling all @GOP and @TheDemocrats to find fixes rather than #RepealAndReplace. #AHCA #BCRA https://t.co/NbKI0gEazx
If it's meaner, give the people an #ACA fix that is kinder, @SenSchumer. #BCRA #AHCA #universalhealthcare https://t.co/uxBXHK6a0n
