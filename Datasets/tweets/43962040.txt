PORTRAITS http://t.co/uehQfpAxZ9
There is a new world of social awareness  which poses a radical challenge to artists
Art can lead people into the future through beauty. Great art illuminates us; it shows us the best of what we are.
People need to care more about the Arts and about artists. They are not going to do that unless artists care more about people.
When modern art was born artists broke free of their historical limitations and in the process, lost sight of their social contract.

Petroleum based paints are out.  Plant based, bio-based paints are in.
@evetheatheist got it
Why use hazardous paints and coatings if you don't have to?
Eco Safety Products, the only sustainable, plant-based scenic paints made from soy, 65% bio mass, made from readily renewable resources!
There is a natural solvent, a soy ester, that is extracted from the pre-consumer post industrial soy material
We use pre-consumer post-industrial waste from the production of vitamin E
Eco Safety Products is currently the only plant based industrial scenic coatings . Super tough clear coats fir stage and screen
Petroleum based scenic coatings are bad.  High performance plant based industrial scenic coatings are good.
Do you really want to use petroleum based paints?
Eco Safety Products makes the only industrial non-petroleum based commercial coatings

Most artists still use petroleum based paints, scenic artists included Don't really want to use petroleum based paints do we? Is it just me?
sustainable bio-based industrial scenic paints and specialty coatings made from recycled soy material, a readily renewable resource.
Sustainable industrial scenic products
Sustainable scenic production needs to be more common. Support the new companies that sell sustainable scenic products!

beware of zero VOC paints that may contain unregulated petroleum based solvents
zero VOC's is not enough. Eco Safety Products is the only truly sustainable scenic coatings, made from readily renewable resources.
If Rosebrand had a Green Section in their catalog would you buy price- neutral, sustainable scenic products from there?
Propylene Glycol, do you know what it is?  It's present in almost every water based commercial paint.
We need allies to make this work.  Don't be uninformed.  Low VOC's seemed enough a few years ago, not anymore. Not with what we know now
We really don't want to use petroleum based paints, do we?
low VOC's is not enough, acrylic and latex paints are still all petroleum based, will people stop using petroleum based paints?

dangerous political toys
We use a soy ester derived from recycled soy, pre-consumer post industrial waste from vitamin E production, replacing petrochemical content.
Propylene glycol is present in water based commercial paints, but NOT in ESP products
We manufacture the ONLY non petroleum based, truly sustainable, plant based scenic industrial coatings in the business.
