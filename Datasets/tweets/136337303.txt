The concerted attacks on No Labels will not scare us away. Our resolve is strong, our team is energized, and citizens across the country support us. We believe this country desperately needs leaders willing to unite us. And we will not be cowed by those who seek to divide us.
The "Hastert Rule" is blatantly undemocratic and it‚Äôs how an immigration bill with 60+ votes in the Senate in 2006 and 2013 could not even get a vote in the House. The Problem Solvers‚Äô rules reforms help ensure this won't happen again.
FACT: For years, Democrats have rightfully been decrying the awful ‚ÄúHastert Rule,‚Äù an informal practice by which a speaker will only bring a bill to the floor if it is supported by a majority of the majority.
FACT: The charge that No Labels only started calling for rule reforms when Democrats assumed power is wrong. In 2011, when Republicans controlled Congress, No Labels released a policy booklet called "Make Congress Work!" which included several policy and rules reform proposals.
FACT: No Labels **never** tried to take down Nancy Pelosi or prevent her from becoming speaker. We wanted rules reforms to fix our broken Congress.
FACT: Many of those lawmakers also led the charge to implement the #BreaktheGridlock rules reforms so essential to fixing our broken Congress that incoming Speaker Nancy Pelosi agreed to last week.
FACT: Throughout 2018 election cycle, No Labels &amp; its allies worked tirelessly &amp; independently to elect Problem Solvers of both parties. This entailed raising &amp; spending $8+ million to support 17 Democratic House candidates &amp; $7+ million to support an equal number of Republicans.
FACT: The first significant political race funded by allies of No Labels was in 2016 and it was a successful effort to defeat Republican Freedom Caucus agitator Tim Huelskamp.
To counter these divisive forces tearing America apart, No Labels has stepped up to provide unprecedented organizational, financial, and electoral support to leaders and candidates committed to working across the aisle to solve our problems.
No Labels‚Äô singular mission is to unite our divided country. For years, the extremes have yanked our leaders to the right and to the left, making compromise and commonsense governance impossible.
In the last week, there has been so much misinformation and slander about the #NoLabels mission and how we carry it out. People have lied about our goals, our leadership, and our strategy. Time to set the record straight. (cc @repmarkpocan)
No Labels respects the right of @repmarkpocan and others to disagree with our approach, but many Americans share our commitment to finding bipartisan solutions to our country‚Äôs toughest problems

@3DCNETWORK We are for bipartisan problem solving. The Problem Solvers Caucus is fighting for a simple and urgent idea. Bills with majority--and even super majority--support across party lines deserve a hearing and a vote.
@Jamesmiltonray Pelosi said Nov 7: "We believe that we have a responsibility to seek common ground where we can. Bipartisanship [is] a very important part of how we will go forward." Problem Solvers are asking for reforms that would enable Pelosi to deliver on the promise she made after midterms

@paulkrugman
Break the Gridlock offers the best, and perhaps only chance, to prevent two more years of inaction on infrastructure, immigration, health care and the other critical problems the American people want solved.
Come January, the House will be controlled by Democrats and the Senate and White House will be controlled by Republicans. This means bipartisan legislation is the ONLY kind of legislation that will become law until at least 2021.
In other words, the Problem Solvers made a PROMISE to voters. And now, they are keeping it.
The Problem Solvers Caucus first released #BreaktheGridlock rules reforms in July. Many of its members, both Democrats &amp; Republicans, publicly committed in September‚Äîmonths before the election‚Äîthat their speaker vote would be contingent on a nominee supporting these rule reforms.
No Labels would enthusiastically support Nancy Pelosi as speaker if she supports these rule changes. The Problem Solvers Caucus has said the same thing.
No Labels is not against Nancy Pelosi or any other speaker candidate. We are FOR rules changes that empower members in both parties who want to work across the aisle to find solutions and prevent the fringes ‚Äì in both parties ‚Äì from perpetuating endless gridlock.
But there is so much misinformation about the goals of this courageous effort. The facts:
No Labels is so proud of the Problem Solvers Caucus, and the commitment of many of its members to vote only for a House speaker who supports rule changes that will give bipartisan ideas a fighting chance in the next Congress.

(2/3) and we are proud that our public support helped get this bill across the finish line. While we recognize that it's not a total solution to reforming our criminal justice system, the FIRST STEP Act is a step in the right direction...

Paul Ryan‚Äôs Retirement Says Something About Congress		https://t.co/ODYc7comoz
One thing that polls well? Bipartisanship. By breaking and changing the rules of the House after this election, bipartisanship might actually have a fighting chance.
With Paul Ryan retiring, it is more important than ever to ensure the next Speaker of the House is willing to work with both parties. #NewHouseNewRules
Congressional disapproval is 81%. Maybe it‚Äôs time to try a new way. Maybe it‚Äôs time to break some rules. By changing the rules, we're hoping to substantially decrease that number. #NewHouseNewRules
@jonfavs @ryangrim @GovHowardDean @ilyseh None. What does this have to do with Dan Lipinski again? He was one of 24Ds who worked day and night to try to get a healthcare deal that would actually pass. For that, he gets nothing but scorn. Way to build a big tent party.
@jonfavs @ryangrim @GovHowardDean @ilyseh We'll take the point head on. Their was no planet on which Republicans would agree to straight CSR fix for nothing in return. Caucus plan gave more flexibility to states in plan design (as did Murray-Alexander)
@ryangrim @jonfavs @GovHowardDean @ilyseh Alexander-Murray is the same basic framework the Caucus proposed. It never happens without Caucus releasing similar plan first over summer		https://t.co/o9mkzgVN20
@jonfavs @ryangrim @GovHowardDean @ilyseh Sounds like your shtick is demanding Dems only support ideas that have no chance of passage for next 3 years. PS Caucus and Lipinski released the ONLY bipartisan healthcare plan in this Congress. Realized both Ds and Rs had to give up something up. It's called legislating.

Each party is guilty of using the Hastert Rule to freeze the other out of the process. This is a systemic issue, and we have a solution. #NewHouseNewRules
The extremes of both parties use the low threshold of 25% to kill a bill to bully leadership and hijack their party's agenda. We need a House that represents all of us, not just a narrow fringe. #NewHouseNewRules
Because of the Hastert rule, little more than 25% of the House can keep a bill from getting a vote that would pass if it made it to the floor. #NewHouseNewRules

@ilyseh In a democracy, people are allowed to have different ideas. Dan Lipinski isn‚Äôt morally deficient because he doesn‚Äôt share all of yours. In fact, that attitude is what‚Äôs destroying this country and making it impossible for us to talk to one another.
@ilyseh Talk to the people around Midway airport‚Äîand we did‚Äîwho voted for him. Many were pro-choice and they voted for him anyway because he fights for working people, because he‚Äôs helped build great schools and because know who to call when there is a problem with their SS checks.
@ilyseh Are you saying all the IL-3 citizens who voted for Dan Lipinski are bigots? I doubt it. Maybe they decided Lipinski‚Äîwho votes with Dems 88% of the time‚Äîactually represents them and what matters most to them and their families.
@ilyseh It means his overall record in Congress and his willingness to do what‚Äôs necessary to govern‚Äîwhich in a divided country means actually working with the other party sometimes‚Äîis more important than his occasional deviation from Democratic party orthodoxy.
@ilyseh Ilyse--you are maliciously ascribing beliefs to No Labels that we simply don't hold. We don't "stand for" a single thing you just accused us of standing for. Supporting Dan Lipinski over Marie Newman does not therefore mean we endorse every one of his positions.
@AriRabinHavt @jonfavs Hey once the left is done excommunicating Lipinski and all other apostates from the party, I guess you'll have to drive out Leader Pelosi too, because she endorsed him. 		https://t.co/nMjtYl0kti
@jonfavs ...especially on issues of manufacturing and trade, that Dems often don't bother talking to anymore.
@jonfavs ...and you'll find lots of true blue Dems who still supported Lipinski thanks to the schools, roads and ballfields he got built. Thanks to his strong position on guns, the environment on education. And thanks, above all, to him looking out for working class people...
@jonfavs Supporting choice, ACA and marriage doesn't make candidate left. Most Dem members of PS Caucus do. What makes candidate left is believing being a Democrats means you must follow the one true path on every issue. Talk to the voters around Midway airport...like we did...
@jonfavs Lipinski is first of dozens of races where No Labels or allies will engage, many of which will be taking on far right obstructionists. Look forward to your thumbs up when we defeat a Freedom Caucus member, or prevent another from getting elected
@jonfavs No Labels endorsing Lipinski doesn't mean we endorse everything he stands for. It means we endorse someone who is one of the few remaining people in Congress--on either side--who recognizes governing in a divided country actually means working with the other party.
@jonfavs You are right: Dan Lipinski is out of step with most Dems on abortion and same sex marriage, including most of his Dem colleagues in the PS Caucus. In 2008 presidential campaign, a certain senator from Illinois didn't support same sex marriage either...
@jonfavs You served in Obama admin and saw every day the pernicious influence of a Freedom Caucus that felt no responsibility to govern or do anything other than obstruct...that said Democrats weren't just wrong, but evil. And now the same thing is happening on the left. How is that OK?
America is divided. And neither party gets to be king or queen for a day and get everything they want. So the one and only way out of this mess is for Democrats and Republicans to seek find common ground. Sometimes seems the Problem Solvers Caucus members are only ones trying.
...So we get members of Congress so dug in, so blinded by partisanship that they won't even talk to people in the other party. They'll attack the other side for saying the sky is blue if they think it will win them a slice of partisan advantage.
People losing picture of what is at stake in wake of Lipinski race. Every election, right and left gets more determined to destroy diversity of opinion within each party. The message: Be with us on everything or leave the party...
@Taniel Trump was one of several presidential candidates who made a Problem Solver Promise; to bring together congressional leaders on both sides after the election to rally around some big goals. He didn't keep the promise.
@AriRabinHavt Murray-Alexander Senate bill was based largely off of Problem Solvers Caucus proposal. Caucus doesn't control what does and doesn't get a vote on floor. But if any major HC legislation passes this Congress, will look a lot like what Caucus proposed
@AriRabinHavt It's a good bill and congrats. But big picture, as Politico says is Sen. Sanders has "big ideas but little impact on Capitol Hill."		https://t.co/97wP3wdz2C
@leedrutman Actually happy to explain. Trump was one of several presidential candidates who made Problem Solver Promise in 2016; agreeing to bring leaders from both parties together around some big goals if elected. He didn't keep the promise. End of story
@GovHowardDean We took on the far left this time. Elsewhere in 2018 we will go after the far right. Enough of the purity and litmus tests. Being a governing party means accommodating diverse views, and Lipinski is with Dems on many more issues than not
@GovHowardDean Gov. Dean-How do you feel about the Freedom Caucus? Do you think they are irresponsible obstructionists? So do we. That's why No Labels ally led effort to take out Kansas Rep. Tim Huelskamp in 2016. We fight the extremism on both sides. 		https://t.co/Xry4QLpbkB
@leedrutman Yes you are actually. Lipinski's opponent was supported by $2M from activist groups across the country. Endorsed by Sen. Sanders and Gellibrand. Whole left rose up to try to get rid of "apostate" Lipinski, just like tea party did on right. They failed, fortunately
Because it needs to be said: No Labels doesn't endorse every position of every candidate we support. What we do endorse are leaders willing to govern. That's Dan Lipinski and the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus. In a divided country, this is only way forward
@AriRabinHavt governing would be introducing a single payer health care plan--and then actually saying how you will pay for it. Something Senator Sanders didn't do		https://t.co/GrDhkUJQhe
@AriRabinHavt Republican in the White House and running Congress. Chance of single payer next 3 years: Zero. So in meantime, why doesn't Bernie actually try to make the system better like Lipinski does? Instead of holding out for perfect
@TVietor08 Left may not like it because we beat one of their faves this time in Lipinski race. Right won't like it when we take out one of their radicals next time. This is the first of many more to come in 2018
@TVietor08 Tommy-What do you think of the Freedom Caucus? Do you think they are out of control obstructionists ruining the country? So do we. That's why we helped take Tim Huelskamp, one of their leaders, in 2016		https://t.co/Xry4QLpbkB
@matthewjdowd This is first race of many where NL and allies will engage in 2018. In this case, we took on far left. Next time may be far right. In fact, NL allies led effort to beat Tea Party bomb thrower Tim Huelskamp in 2016		https://t.co/Xry4QLpbkB
@matthewjdowd Matt--No Labels does not endorse every position of Dan Lipinski. We don't endorse every position of others in Problem Solvers Caucus. We do endorse people who actually do what it takes to govern...and that means working with the other side. No evidence Newman was willing to do it
@DanteAtkins Not at all. We don't endorse everything Lipinski says or does. Same goes for others in the PS Caucus. What we do endorse is people actually willing to do what it takes to govern. And in a divided country that requires something the extremes can't tolerate: working with other side
@AriRabinHavt PS--the story accusing No Labels of supporting McConnel to be speaker. 100% unverified garbage
@AriRabinHavt ...it wasn't perfect. But it responded to a real crisis. Meanwhile, Bernie was holding press conference touting single payer healthcare. Lipinski was governing. Bernie was posing for the cameras and positioning for 2020
@AriRabinHavt This schism isn't about policy and ideology as much as it is about what it takes to govern. Example: Last summer Lipinski, and the Problem Solvers Caucus released the first and ONLY bipartisan health care agreement to prevent insurance premiums from spiking....
@AriRabinHavt Trump and several other candidates made a Problem Solvers Promise at our convention--to bring both leaders together after the election begin some big goals. It's obviously a promise he didn't keep
@jonfavs In this race, we protected the center left from the far left. But in other 2018 races, we'll take on the far right. In fact, we helped take out Tea Party nut job Tim Huelskamp in 2016		https://t.co/Xry4QLpbkB
@jonfavs No Labels has never, not once, not anywhere said we oppose same sex marriage. We oppose the endless litmus tests of the far right and the far left. And we support people who actually want to govern.
@AriRabinHavt We stand against far left and far right. In fact, we led effort to take out out Freedom Caucus whack job Tim Huelskamp in 2016, https://t.co/XoecgwPFtu
@AriRabinHavt Bernie isn't a Democrat yet somehow he decides who gets to be in the party?! Let's make this real clear: No Labels doesn't endorse everything Lipinski stands for. What we do endorse is people who actually legislate and govern as opposed to ranting to make base happy
"Too often in America, mainstream ideas are sidelined by those on the far left and far right who have their own axes to grind. Dan Lipinski showed that shrill demands need not drown out mainstream voices."		-Margaret White, writing in @thehill 	https://t.co/F1ICm9tqwD
But the far left failed, and the country is a lot better off for it. #IL03 /5
This was a targeted mission by the far left to mandate that every candidate fall into lockstep with the Bernie Sanders wing of the party. /4

Ever wonder how 70-80% of the country can support immigration reform and sensible solutions to gun violence, while Congress does nothing? It‚Äôs the Hastert rule. #NewHouseNewRules
For the record, the Hastert rule isn't even a rule. It's just what Speakers of the House do to make sure they don't lose the support of their own party. We can do better. #NewHouseNewRules
Current House rules lock the minority party out of the process entirely. There is a better way. #NewHouseNewRules

Lesson from today: both Ds &amp; Rs must be invited to table. Problem solvers want to work together to get things done for Americans.
Congrats to the many Democrats and Republicans who sat down today together at the Problem Solvers Caucus -- they are finding common ground.

The freedom caucus may overplay its hand and wind up empty handed. Perhaps their intransigence will force a more bipartisan approach.
Let the investigations take their course but let's press forward with the business of the people -- healthcare reform, tax reform and more.
.@MikeBloomberg urges Democrats not to adopt the very tactics they had long opposed. https://t.co/vm1WU8B2He via @bv 	A courageous sentiment
Healthcare bill needs fixes. Places too high a burden on seniors, reduces healthcare for the poor. People want to move forward not backward
North Korea is the most dangerous rogue nation today and Tillerson is right to push China to clip the wings of its mad man leader.
Healthcare is the new third rail of politics. The public wants lower costs but not by covering fewer people. Cries out for real leadership.
We should be debating the cbo report on whether 24m people could lose healthcare under Ryan's bill -- not wall-to-wall on old tax returns.
Perhaps Washington needed a good snow storm to cool off and start negotiating better, more affordable health.
These Democrats are committed to working in a bi-partisan fashion to fix healthcare! 	https://t.co/0zCM11MjC0
Enough of Russia. Time to focus on America. Dems need to engage on healthcare to save Medicaid expansion or risk a deal with the right.
Let's all say congrats to No Labels Co-Chair @JonHuntsman on agreeing to serve as Ambassador to Russia. We know we can count on him.
It's time for Democrats and Republicans to negotiate healthcare and not leave it to Republicans to negotiate with conservative Republicans
‚ÄúThe pragmatic approach taken by No Labels is needed now more than ever.‚Äù - @SenatorCollins https://t.co/EBz6CxH47E
Everyone is calling for more investigations. But perhaps we need fewer accusatory tweets and fewer investigations and get down to business.

We are a deeply divided country but unless we reduce partisanship on all sides we will tear our country apart rather than bring it together.
President was right to say "you're fired" to Flynn. Now it's time to get out of campaign mode and reboot the White House
No question that you can't stay as national security adviser if you were not 100 per cent accurate in reporting to VP Pence

NYTimes:U.S. Commando Killed in Yemen in Trump‚Äôs First Counterterror Operation. Seriously "Trump's"? We are the USA and the US military.
You don't need to be a rocket scientist to have honored all granted visas in transit rather than create a mess.
America will be torn apart unless all parties sit down and craft true comprehensive immigration reform.
This week we saw the good bad and ugly. Government freezes to immigration freezes to pipeline unfreezes. America First but not One America.
Meetings with allies like Mexico should be "no conditions" meetings because the countries are best of friends even if some differences.
Walls won't keep the world out and kids brought here deserve a fair chance but you also can't leave real felons here. That's common sense.

@wkpixley1 Our unique strategic focus is getting leaders to solve problems in the political environment that exists - not the ideal one.
@wkpixley1 But that effort could take many years of state-by-state slogs to see real change. America needs solutions in the mean time.
