We can’t let this happen again in Iraq. It’s time the Iraqi government recognize its inability to prosecute ISIL and allow for an impartial international investigation, thus giving these crimes against the Assyrians and Yazidis the attention and reconciliation they deserve.
An Iraqi process is oversentencing, no reconciliation, and the Yazidis and Assyrians will be right back where they started. Remember what created ISIL, the US policy of de-Ba’athification which summarily dismissed the entire Ba’ath party, from the leadership to the foot soldiers.
We need a tribunal, established like the ICC or ad-hoc via a UNSC resolution, that has the capacity, neutrality, and fair understanding of the laws of war to try these cases. Lebanon enlisted the international community to investigate Hariri’s murder, Iraq should do the same.
Iraqi Justice Ministry is definitely eager to prosecute. So eager that it sentences cooks with the same terms as they do combatants. This is a colossal miscarriage of justice. As an Assyrian, I want justice for my people. But this isn’t what we’ll get through an Iraqi process.
And mind you, this is by no means some “Iraq expert” drivel, I’ve actually spoken with diplomats at varying levels of the Iraqi Foreign Ministry who have said, in no fewer words, that Iraq would not allow this happen. As if their judiciary system is so reliable...
I find it so interesting that so many Iraqis will support Yazidis and Assyrians by admitting that ISIL’s crimes do indeed constitute genocide, and yet the Iraqi government will not grant the ICC temporary jurisdiction over the three years that ISIL occupied territory in Iraq. https://t.co/eBUOJhQ2Qk
