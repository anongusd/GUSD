@sdut He’s a waste of time! Old socialist talking points. I noticed the tv cameras concentrating on the tight crowd, when just a few feet away, the auditorium was empty. #walkaway
@HillaryClinton https://t.co/Hlw8itdVF5
@RobertWasinger https://t.co/5uqgcWsSvX
@newsbusters Why is he wearing lipstick? Halloween isn’t here yet.
@10News Who cares what Bruce has to say? The guy is mentally ill. Sad!
@KUSINews There are other dispensary’s in Fallbrook. Why was this the only one closed? You’re article states there’s only two allowed in the unincorporated areas of San Diego County. Did I miss something?
@MichaelAvenatti This story has already been debunked. Stop spreading bullshit.
@JohnBrennan You lie every time your lips move.
@10News “We’re from the government and we’re here to help” What a joke!
@sdut Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
@DailyCaller Ivanka would tear her up on Election Day!
@TheRealJohnHCox @GavinNewsom Fact!
@realDonaldTrump Democrats can’t help being ignorant. They don’t like facts. They claim to be the party of inclusion and tolerance...laughable!
@KayaJones @realDonaldTrump This is all a democrat setup!
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends While the liberal spell-police are making fun of you, Mr. President, there are more people that support you and your efforts to keep our country safe!
@RealOmarNavarro You have a point, but she’ll be gone from power soon when you take her spot.
@SDSheriff @SDSONorthCoast @CityDelMar When are you going to start issuing CCW permits to us average citizens so we are able to protect ourselves?
@DLoesch That idiot is in Canada. Tough guy... @V_of_tReason
@KyleWOrton Hillary needs to stand trial. She already has the jumpsuit.
@pozmagazine @Aspield Big assumption that democrats are the way to go. The woman running for Governor of Georgia once burned the American flag, the guy running for Governor of Florida was caught red-handed accepting bribes from the FBI, the guy running for senator in Texas got drunk and fled the scene
@RealOmarNavarro I’m not in your district, but I really hope you kick @RepMaxineWaters’s ass on Election Day!
@YossiGestetner @brianstelter @Cernovich @NolteNC @HillaryClinton @HillaryClinton wouldn’t know her ass from a hole in the ground. We’re talking Grand Canyon sized hole...
@brianstelter You must be embarrassed to be you! You lie like a rug.
@secupp The press isn’t the enemy of the people, but @CNN sure is!
@fox5sandiego Wonder if @keithellison will ever come clean about his abuse of women?
@nbcsandiego The Brooklyn Bums...
@VAKruta Wonder if @amyschumer will give the child up for adoption so he/she can have a better life? Even babies laugh at liberal tears!
@V_of_tReason @DLoesch Liberals like sniffing dog farts. It’s like a breath of fresh air to them.
@DailyCaller @CNN reports fake news all the time! One just has to look up old clips from CNN on YouTube about the first gulf war and how CNN faked a missile attack on Kuwait.
@eviefordham @DailyCaller Both cuomo’s lie like rugs! @NYGovCuomo @CNN @ChrisCCuomo
@ChrisCuomo @Scaramucci Hey, cuomo! You’re the only one on the planet that has hemorrhoids in his mouth.
@eswanson76 @kyle_ricci @traderkishore @charliekirk11 I wonder what you’d say if that was acid or some other chemical. Typical liberal idiot.
@charliekirk11 Just another soy-boy...
@WCCO @Cernovich I bet she has an uncle daddy.
@WSJ In a second study, it was discovered that the other 50% were men.
@NYTScience Well, we did have our first (and last) tranny First Lady a couple of years ago.
@Ocasio2018 @MMFlint Communist!
@JackPosobiec We have better free stuff...
@nbcsandiego I wish they’d ban those things. Ride a bike!
@RealSaavedra @maziehirono, I see you’re hitting the bottle again. Sober up lady!
@yellowredsparks @Cernovich I first saw Night of the Living Dead when it first came out in theaters back in ‘68. Watched it a million times over the decades since.

@TheRealJohnHCox @EVCMedia @GavinNewsom is a soy-boy.
@ASavageNation Absolutely!
@nbcsandiego Isn’t @nikimanaj14 guilty of cultural appropriation?
@OANN @YouTube The only thing @BarackObama isn’t lying about is his love of Chicago bathhouses.
@DailyCaller @amyschumer wants everyone to stay away from the big Bowl because she wants to devour everything in it.
@cspan @BarackObama The only thing @BarackObama can really relate to is a bathhouse in Chicago.
@ArtFruh @KyleKashuv @NRA Why do you hate the United States of America and our Constitution, @artfruh? You and your fellow communist soy-boys are the crazy ones!
@JudicialWatch Oh, @HillaryClinton! You and your silly rapist husband, @BillClinton, will rot in hell!
@Acosta @acosta had his widdle feewings hurt again! Everyone is so mean to @CNN!
@nbcsandiego I laugh at liberal tears!
@MelissaTweets Don’t tell @CNN!
@MarcACaputo @KyleKashuv @FBI @AndrewGillum, got any extra tickets?
@SanDiegoCounty The Fallbrook sheriffs substation has a drug drop box that’s available year round. Help save some lives!
@ianbremmer @RoughnReady48 Liberals don’t believe in using dictionaries.
@bigleaguepol @facebook sucks!
@KirstenPowers Who the hell do you think you are? Boss of Halloween? By the way, your breath is horrendous!
@JudicialWatch I hope @HillaryClinton rots in prison when she’s finally convicted!
@newsbusters @JohnKingCNN, all of America thinks you’re stupid.
@Kasparov63 @BruceBartlett You obviously never opened up a dictionary.
@BruceBartlett You’re the Nazi!
@ConanOBrien @Cernovich You going to take a few families into your home, Conan? I’ll wait...
@nbcsandiego It won’t last...
@andylassner It’s hilarious that you actually believe propaganda. You’ll be needing a box of tissues on election night like you needed in 2016. @TheEllenShow is losing viewers because of you.
@KayaJones @WWERomanReigns Cancer sucks!
@tedlieu @RepJerryNadler @realDonaldTrump You such a communist, Ted Lieu!
@RealSaavedra You suck @BarackObama, that’s a FACT!
@Millie__Weaver I’d say is was @BarackObama but he wouldn’t approve of women participating on account of he only thinks of men.
@SkyNews We can trust Turkey. LOL Not!
@nbcsandiego If I win, I’ll share it with my fellow conservatives in California.
@Cernovich You only say this because it’s your film. Ok, I’ll take a look.
@SkyNews @realDonaldTrump More concern over a non-citizen than was shown over the murder of our ambassador in Benghazi. All aimed at our president. Liberal hypocrisy!
@SelfEnhancement glad you canned the ass-wipe!
@nbcsandiego It’s not rhetoric, but then that wouldn’t fit your liberal narrative.
@JacobAWohl @MichaelAvenatti has an intimate relationship with Soros.
@PhilipRucker @maggieNYT @katierogers This is exactly why I don’t watch fake MSNBC.
@SkyNews Didn’t hear the same outrage about Ambassador Stephens in Benghazi. Doesn’t fit the liberal narrative.
@DailyCaller Democrats are happy.
@10News God bless you, Bob!
@SkyNews @amyschumer Not even born yet and I feel sorry for him/her.
@Ocasio2018 Understand this language...fuck you and your communist ways.
@ElizLanders @davidgshortell Awe, c’mon... he dindu nuffin!
@SaraCarterDC @JudicialWatch Don’t let these bastards in!
@IvankaTrump Jared’s a lucky man to have such a smart and beautiful wife.
@VOANews Deport!
@DailyCaller This is beyond stupid. Where was the outrage over our Ambassador Stephens being murdered? Doesn’t fit the liberal narrative.
@MichaelAvenatti used to get mad over having to ride the short bus to school.
@NTKNet @SenWarren, you suck as a human being. How dare you call yourself an American.
@DailyCaller He’s a fool.
@fox5sandiego All written by @BarackObama.
@JackPosobiec @cenkuygur is a communist.
@RandPaul Our ambassador was murdered in Benghazi and all you care about is Hashoggi?
@JackPosobiec I’d say fuck Obama, but he’d like that. @BarackObama  Bathhouse Barry
Poor Bill Clinton has to sleep with Killary. Well, maybe they deserve each other.
@IngrahamAngle @CNNPolitics You suck Acosta, you communist.
@KayaJones Vote @TheRealJohnHCox!
@newtgingrich They want free stuff. Welfare, healthcare, education to name a few. Protect our borders!
@joshdcaplan Awe, c’mon! He dindu nuffin.
@DailyCaller Why is that dude wearing lipstick?
@sdut The Affordable Care Act isn’t affordable at all! We don’t qualify for subsidies and bare minimum insurance is nothing but a ripoff!
@Acosta @Acosta, you lying sack of dog turds!
@mxacdumlao You have serious mental issues.
@WayneDupreeShow Invasion set up by the left.

@realDonaldTrump Cut these countries off from ALL aid, period!
@BenSasse You care more about a Saudi citizen than you did for Ambassador Stevens in Benghazi.
@Ahmadinejad1956 You’re so full of shit. How many political prisoners are there in Iranian prisons?
@fox5sandiego Kill a cop, get the death penalty. Period!
@mend_yu Guess!

@kathygriffin Diarrhea is funnier than you are!
@peta So, little kids in school, drinking their milk, attend KKK rallies now? You’re nuts!
@foxandfriends Run? He’ll, @HillaryClinton can’t even walk!
@AndrewGillum @NRA Gillum, the communist, wants your guns!
@JacobAWohl No one watches @CNN anymore and @MaxBoot is an ass anyway so who cares?
@NBCNews These aren’t migrants! They’re invaders! Stop being so stupid NBC!
@kimguilfoyle Why doesn’t @realDonaldTrump come to California to show support for @TheRealJohnHCox? We need California to survive the barrage of liberal lunacy!
@DailyCaller Run? Hell, she can’t even walk!
@DailyCaller Collateral damage...
@IngrahamAngle @NBCNews NBC = Never Been Correct
@Acosta Acosta, the loser clown, thinks old ladies want to start a civil war. What a jackass!
@DailyCaller She looks like a man with a bad wig.
@rachelvmckinnon You have some nerve calling yourself a doctor of philosophy when you judge everyone that doesn’t agree with you a homophobes and transphobes. Not everyone hates because you choose to hate. Go compete in trans sports, I think all issues would be solved.
@rachelvmckinnon You’re not a woman.
@JacobAWohl I thought Mexico had a freakin wall on their southern border.
@BretBaier Bret, if you don’t get Trump’s sense of humor by now you never will.
@AP @ACUConservative Don’t let these people into our country! They need to fix their own country’s problems! They don’t want anything but ‘free’ stuff from us. Build the wall! @realDonaldTrump will stop this nonsense!
@sdut The apple didn’t fall far from the tree. This is yet another reason why we need to keep @Rep_Hunter in Congress!
@AnaCabrera CNN SUCKS!
@TomiLahren This is yet another reason why California needs @TheRealJohnHCox for our next governor!
@TheRealJohnHCox @carldemaio My wife and I voted yesterday! Go John!
@townhallcom @morningmika I think you’re misspelling whoresface.          @RealDonad_Trump @azdesertjewel @AnnCoulter @Cernovich @IngrahamAngle @SarahPalinUSA
@Cernovich The media is spending more time on this story than they did for our American Ambassador and other citizens that were murdered in Benghazi. Typical liberal crap!
@TexasTribune @BetoORourke is a socialist hack politician! Go @tedcruz!
@StormyDaniels Who cares what you have to say? Boring...
@bigleaguepol No! She’d get us in a war!
@MichaelAvenatti You’re a joke, Avenatti!
@KUSINews Good! It’s not so much the bikes, but the scooters.
@MichaelAvenatti @secupp Avenatti as president? LOL Too funny! What a joke! You’re not even a good creepy porn lawyer!
@RBReich Robert Reich... what a joke! Don’t preach! Remember you worked for Rapist Bill Clinton!
@w_terrence This is another reason why @CNN sucks!
@RootedMil @andrewklavan @realDailyWire @yaf @PJMedia_com You’re such a soy-boy.
@Acosta Would somebody please buy Jim @Acosta a new pussy hat? The one he’s wearing has faded, just like his career.
@thehill What was the question again? @donnabrazile do you have the question?
@Cernovich Portland is the home of the stinky man-bun. Bunch of unemployed bums!
Grand-slam! https://t.co/v57YdvVkU5
@SenJohnKennedy Thanks, buddy! I’m going to follow you on your progress. I’m a disabled man on SSDI. My wife stays at home as my caretaker. Insurance for her is so expensive! It’s almost as much as our mortgage! Please help!
@Acosta @JackPosobiec He was referring to democrats.
@MichaelAvenatti @BetoORourke Avenatti, you don’t have a brain. People without brains always vote for democrats.
@Alyssa_Milano Hypocrite! You always look the other way when it comes to Bill Clinton and his rapey ways...
@RealOmarNavarro @foxandfriends I’m not in your district, but I certainly would vote for you to replace Mad Maxine! @RepMaxineWaters
@davidcushmanCA Happy Birth Anniversary! A yard sign would look really cool in my front yard. Thanks buddy!
@Alyssa_Milano Milano, you’re delusional.
@KyleKashuv These are the same socialist idiots that don’t even know how to use a can opener.
@RealOmarNavarro @foxandfriends @RepMaxineWaters is nuts! She’s full of hate and disdain towards @realDonaldTrump because of his success as president. Omar Navarro will represent his district well! Go away, Maxine!
@GavinNewsom We don’t want socialized medical care in California! Socialists like you ruin everything that’s touched! We need @TheRealJohnHCox for Governor!
@USATODAY @realDonaldTrump @usatodayopinion Go Trump!
@BridgetPhetasy @Cernovich Nice language. You kiss your mother with that mouth?
@TomiLahren Tomi, I like you a lot, but you’re fibbing right now! Bad girl!
@jerryspringer Jerry, you misspelt ‘Big’.
@LAPDHQ @Cernovich Hope they gave you a special treat tonight, Molly!
@MichaelAvenatti Avenatti, you don’t have a chance in hell in becoming president. Great $ scam though with the donations thing.
@BrettKavanaugh God bless you, Justice Kavanaugh!
@Ocasio2018 Stupid words fell out of your mouth, again! You know nothing about our Constitution! Idiot...
@RedDeplorable @FBI You guys see this?
@TheRealJohnHCox If Newsom wins, we all lose!
@kaitlancollins @Cernovich @alweaver22 And having ebola is funny? You have a sick mind...
@gatewaypundit @JacobAWohl @Cernovich @JackPosobiec @CassandraRules Looks like she ate a few too many cheeseburgers.
@marina282828 @SmittyWrite @RealDeanCain @SenFeinstein No one wants to sleep with a feminist.
@pozmagazine @AIDS_United Having HIV doesn’t automatically make one a liberal. What the democrats did to Kavanaugh is disgraceful!
@kaitlancollins CNN... from hero to zero once they were exposed for all their propaganda!
@kaitlancollins @Cernovich You lie like a rug!
@ziadtheactivist When you’re 25, you’ll look back and understand how stupid your tweet was.
@davidhogg111 Your stupidity is the biggest danger...
@SenBlumenthal Da Nang Dick, senator from CT. The only thing missing is UN.
@SenBlumenthal I’m glad you’re angry and sad. That means the country is doing well! #DaNangDick
@GovMikeHuckabee @lisamurkowski Her daddy appointed her to the senate when he was the governor of Alaska. She doesn’t know what winning truly looks like.
@Alyssa_Milano @MeetThePress Alyssa who?
@mschlapp Don’t forget the guys wearing pussy hats!
@ValerieJarrett BILL CLINTON IS A RAPIST AND HILLARY HELPED IN THE SMEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE VICTIMS! You’re such a fool!
@Ocasio2018 What an idiot! LOL
@ValerieJarrett Bill Clinton is an actual rapist. The hypocrisy of the left is astounding.
@ChuckGrassley Thank you!
@theblaze Then they shouldn’t divide it. Got to laugh at liberals.
@realDonaldTrump Way to go!
@CaliforniaLabor Union hacks!
@SenWarren @Indivisible_F Fake Indian!
@TheRealJohnHCox John, please visit and speak to the folks in Fallbrook!
@Cernovich What’s the difference between a duck?
@iVoteFund The liberals are bitching about the right to kill babies.
@FBI All the naysayers are just armchair quarterbacks...	FBI, you folks do an awesome job every single day!
@HillaryClinton Did you fall down again and go boom? Grow up!
@LadyThriller69 Cute kid... I bet he likes playing with LEGO’s!
@RobHerring @OANN @realDonaldTrump @TheRealJohnHCox I’m a conservative that happens to live in a small town in California. There are a lot of conservatives here, but the liberal, highly populated areas of Los Angeles and San Francisco ruin it for everyone. We need John Cox as governor over Gavin Newsom!
@politico Go Kavanaugh! Our next Supreme Court Justice!
@realDonaldTrump Thank you, Mr. President! No president, since I’ve been alive for over 5 decades, has truly cared for the average citizen of this country until you came along!
@FAIRImmigration Correct me if I’m wrong, but didn’t a judge recently strike down California’s sanctuary state law?
@GOPChairwoman Liberals are so full of hate for their fellow Americans just because they don’t follow the liberal group-thinking.
@RealOmarNavarro @Alyssa_Milano I laugh at liberal tears!
@deborahDrBSmith @WeSupport45 @ralph56299728 @realDonaldTrump @SenFeinstein @RepAnnaEshoo Why is Hillary wearing a shower curtain?

@JohnBrennan John O. Brennan, communist.

@KamalaHarris @JeffreyGuterman Harris the Hack!
@DailyCaller They need to raise the voting age to 21 seeing that Gov. Browndoggle thinks anyone under 21 is too immature. #2A
@AdeleScalia The left has nothing but hate for their fellow Americans that they disagree with.
@TomArnold @ChrisA_8816 Tom Arnold, I think you may have accidentally flushed your little brain down the toilet again. Maybe you do that on purpose because you enjoy visiting your mom.
@ScottAdamsSays @Cernovich Ageist fool!
@JillFilipovic LOL
@SidrahMay @JillFilipovic Why do you hate men? It’s not healthy to have hate in your heart. You’ll die young from stress. Most men are decent, loving and hard working. I feel the same way towards women. Ease up on the hatred. Peace to you.
@kathygriffin Hag!
@foxandfriends Hopefully, this will be ruled as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.
