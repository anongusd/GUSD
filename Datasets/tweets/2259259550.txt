"The time for trivial fights is behind us" - Donald Trump...less than a week ago
‚ÄúPOTUS put his reputation..his predecessor's..&amp; the nation at risk to get at least a draw out of the next 24 hrs of news.‚Äù-@GenMhayden on MJ
Why does Trump want an investigation by CONGRESS for information from the EXECUTIVE BRANCH on wire tapping?
The finale: "That's it. I'm hanging up. We're over, have a good life" says girl what will definitely not be their last convo #AmtrakBreakup
Seems to have entered the part of a breakup convo when you say the same thing over and over. Lots of synonyms for "done" #AmtrakBreakup
"You're not changing. I've waited too long for you to change" says girl (for the third time" #AmtrakBreakup
If this ride couldn't be more stressful, the man behind me just started to dig in to what smells like a tuna sandwich #AmtrakBreakup
"Is this what you wanted?!" says girl to guy that clearly did not want this #AmtrakBreakup
I'd like to take this time to hype El Chucho's street corn again because it really is incredible #AmtrakBreakup
This, she says, is the "straw that broke the camel's back." She hopes beers at "fucking El Chucho" was worth it #OrderTheCorn #AmtrakBreakup
"Yes, I'm serious. I couldn't be more serious" says girl #AmtrakBreakup
Girl breaks long time period of sighing with a poetic line: "then I guess we can't be a we" #AmtrakBreakup
Now she's in the classic eyes-closed-hand-on-forehead-rubbing-temples pose. The optics are looking pretty bad for this dude #AmtrakBreakup
@BenBrodyDC I have hope
More head shaking, eye rolling, as poor (possibly drunk) boyfriend (who wasn't at work!) apparently tries to explain himself #AmtrakBreakup
"I have a lot of thinking to do" says girl. Follows one minute later (after much thought) with "I'm just done. I'm over it." #AmtrakBreakup
@BenBrodyDC this girl is speaking for all straight women in America
Now a lot of listening, eye rolling &amp; head shaking, mentions she has PLENTY of men in NYC, "I'm not some wall flower" #AmtrakBreakup
Girl is "sick of always doing what [boyfriend] wants to do" follows his retort with "that's absolutely false" #AmtrakBreakup
From what I gather, the issue at hand involves the boyfriend saying he was at work, but, alas, he was drinking with friends #AmtrakBreakup
