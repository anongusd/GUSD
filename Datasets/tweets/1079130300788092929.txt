@SenGillibrand The climate according to Scientists and the graphs showing ice pack and temperatures, are perfectly normal if not colder. This is bullshit. Free medical is bull. Years on waitlist , and control from government . Stop spending our hard earned tax dollars for free rides-earn it!
Instead of expecting free Education, Healthcare, child care, etc etc , reduce the over inflated prices and we could afford. Government just wants their hands in every pot, to insure dependency, then the control is born! Stop with the free ride , earn it
@SenWarren The Government can not pay for free everything!!! God says a man works for what he gets, if not, no better than jnfidel . The money you all want to use to pay for free rides, comes from us, we the people! Stop this free crap. Reduce the costs to normal and we can

@SenGillibrand The federal Government shouldn’t be involved in 80% of what it involves itself in! Also, college should be for those jobs that truly require extended knowledge! Eg: Doctor , Lawyer, etc. Most degrees you can get on computer college courses. Which by the way, most colleges use.

@flywithkamala @senatemajldr Voting should not be easy just fair and legal! What is wrong with you all? They should not! Be able to vote when they broke the main law of the land! Illegal entry does not equal voting rights! We need to care for our own homeless, needy and hungry here! Everything isn’t free
@stutteringjohnm @senatemajldr Also, we can’t afford to support millions with a free ride and give them privileges if they are breaking our laws. My tax dollars should be helping homeless and hungry children already here. The wall is cheaper than all this support of millions!
@stutteringjohnm @senatemajldr They are not at all time low! Lol they are in fact at the highest. The wall keeps illegals out - ILLEGALS, not immigrants. Immigrants follow the laws of the land. When all of you who are so against it lose a child or family , or they are raped or trafficked you will feel the need

@Education4Libs I agree! The media is so far gone! So many people who were at that rally posted their Full length videos of the event on FB,Instagram, Twitter! Yes, i said full length. Do they really think in today’s world, we will believe the context of media?
