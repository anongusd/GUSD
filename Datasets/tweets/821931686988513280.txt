@ValentinGosu If you're afraid that you could emotionally hurt someone with your "truth" then by all means, keep it concealed. Doesn't mean that you have to lie out of guilt. Just shut up and avoid discourse or engage and comfort them with your words.
@washingtonpost I can't speak for most Americans, but growing up in the "hood" and later moving to a middle-class subdivision, you learn to appreciate certain amenities. You don't need much to survive, but to thrive, it takes a functioning community that cares about you and your wellbeing.

@006Semajbond @AnikaBlasian Twerk videos make the same amount of sense. Childish.
@msttrader facks.
@angieeex0 @AnikaBlasian You're still ugly though.

@Tatev__A @latimes Not a bad way to spend movie profits at all. Much better than sending $20 mil USD to Armenia... That's 9,688,795,876.45 Dram for education.
@EconomyWrld Do you actually play, or is this a commercial?
@swetrader I'd agree if someone else said it, but yeah... You're right.

@CPBlr In America YOU'D be treated as a criminal irrespective of cast, creed, color, or NATIONALITY. Think about that.
@Alisa_Melekhina, how many FM's or GM's have you created, trained, or coached? Your lectures on YouTube are too informative to be free. ü§ù
