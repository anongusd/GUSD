🚨OH boy. The government has notified Judge Amy Berman Jackson of Roger Stone's Instagram story from yesterday, where he shared an image that claimed he was framed. https://t.co/gg7OwhQEpA
In terms of reading into the actual documents requests, that may not be very useful—some questions to certain people are speculative, 2 committee sources told me, including this one to Rhona Graff for info about Trump's conversations with Putin. https://t.co/HFq36I66wq https://t.co/9wkwfYSTfi
None of the witnesses contacted by House Judiciary today were hit with brand new document requests that haven’t been asked of them before, by either the special counsel, SDNY, or Congress. Mueller and SDNY were aware these requests were going out. https://t.co/HFq36I66wq

I’m not sure whether this is the photo Senate investigators showed Liebman, but here’s Trump in Russia in ‘96 with Calamari in the background. https://t.co/BoXOKaYGPG
Investigators also brought with them a photo of Matthew Calamari with Trump in Russia in 1996, I’m told, and asked Liebman about him. Cohen named Calamari earlier this week as someone who might know about the Trump Org’s alleged tax and insurance fraud.
Senate investigators have been particularly interested in David Geovanis, an American businessman who helped organize the 1996 Russia trip and used to work for Deripaska. Investigators asked Liebman about the parties Geovanis threw, and whether G was Trump’s “fixer” in Russia.
New: It’s not just Dems interested in Trump’s business dealings. Senate Intel has homed in on Trump’s 1996 visit to Russia, &amp; just over a week ago interviewed architect Ted Liebman who designed one of the buildings Trump proposed to Moscow city officials. https://t.co/RTFN33yvtb

@SimonMaloy Nooo she’s so young and innocent

McCabe, in his book, on the Gang of 8 briefing: "Rosenstein went to talk to Nunes, came back, told me, Nunes is staying, he says he’s not recused from this, he refuses to leave...At the end of the day it’s his recusal, I can’t enforce it. We can’t kick him out of the room." https://t.co/8mZjMZwapz
Per McCabe, Chris Wray asked him to step down in Jan 2018, after conferring w/the IG &amp; shortly after Trump tweeted that McCabe was "racing the clock to retire." Wray "wanted me to represent that as a voluntary move. I would not do that," McCabe told me. So he took leave instead.

Oh boy. Judge Amy Berman Jackson doesn't seem happy with Roger Stone. https://t.co/jCS7QJ2X2T
And here is what McCabe says about this in the book: "Now that the Gang of Eight was a crowd of two dozen in the room, I thought, the chance of this not getting back to the president was basically zero. Then Devin Nunes walked in, and the chance was less than zero."
We had to cut this for length, but McCabe told me that his guess is that the White House "immediately knew the steps I took after Jim got fired, and the cases I opened" because of Nunes. "When I was surprised to see Nunes at the briefing, I knew it would happen very quickly." https://t.co/SnxcSxWLAL
McCabe says everyone was in shock over Trump's "I believe Putin" remark. "How do you effectively convey intelligence to the American president who chooses to believe the Russians over his own intelligence services? And then tells them that to their faces?" https://t.co/0hAhjc86Zs

Q: Was FBI's judgment too clouded by Comey's firing to credibly open this investigation?	McCabe: "I could see how that would fit if we'd initiated this concern in the wake of Jim’s firing. The fact is, we were building to this point for months before." https://t.co/0hAhjc86Zs

Just published: My interview with McCabe, who told me concerns about whether Trump "posed a national-security threat that we should be investigating had been building for some time" before Comey's firing—&amp; that not opening a case wasn't a credible option. https://t.co/0hAhjc86Zs

JUST IN: Mueller has requested another delay in Rick Gates' sentencing. "Defendant Gates continues to cooperate with respect to several ongoing investigations, and accordingly the parties do not believe it is appropriate to commence the sentencing process at this time." https://t.co/zVWeTws6Zn
This is the Whitaker precedent--he sought ethics officials' advice but ultimately didn't follow it. (they advised him to recuse.) And it's what Senate Dems were afraid of. https://t.co/JEuf0VMx0z
Barr on recusal: "I will seek the advice [of ethics officials], but under the regulations, I make the decision as head of the agency as to my own recusal...At the end of the day, I would make a decision in good faith based on the laws and the facts that are evident at that time."

@EliLake @joeiavovella @Susan_Hennessey ? The FBI investigation was launched after Trump fired Comey, according to the Times. If that is accurate then he wasn’t lying.
@packerpoppa oh yeah! that too.
@AltNatSecAgency yes but that was after the FBI opened its investigation.  I'm just talking about before.
Barr shared his memo w/White House special counsel Emmet Flood, WH counsel Pat Cipollone, Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow, &amp; Kushner attorney Abbe Lowell. Sen. Coons believes Barr essentially "tried out" for the AG job. Sens. Hirono and Leahy want him to recuse. https://t.co/JEuf0VMx0z
This has become Trump allies’ main talking point. It ignores that: Obama didn’t fire the FBI director investigating him, share classified information with the Russians, or call on Russia to hack his political opponent. (And that’s only before the FBI opened the investigation.) https://t.co/6xKz5g1TWt
The FBI viewed Trump’s attempt to obstruct the Russia probe as a serious national security issue. But Barr believes that inquiry is “fatally misconceived”—&amp; shared that opinion with Trump’s AND Kushner’s lawyers, per a letter he sent to Graham last night. https://t.co/JEuf0VMx0z

Compromised *
@8bit_bb I use “was” loosely
The NYT report highlights the fact that many assume Trump has only ever been officially under investigation for obstruction of justice. The new takeaway (though probably already assumed by most) is that Trump himself was also an individual subject of a counterintel investigation.
Stepping back for a minute: If no other reporting existed on Trump/Russia, the fact that the FBI started a CI investigation to determine whether or not the sitting president of the US was either comprised by or an agent of Russia, it would be the biggest political story...ever. https://t.co/RRenfxbgmH

@nycsouthpaw Hmm..not sure I understand this story. I was under the impression that determining whether or not Trump was compromised by Russia and therefore acting in Putin’s interests was the entire point of the Russia investigation, which began as a counterintelligence investigation.

@Zigmanfreud @Isikoff I mean, if Trump tasked Cohen with paying off Russians in Prague then Cohen is not the big fish here that Mueller would want.

@Zigmanfreud @Isikoff He only got 3 years. And is still cooperating with Mueller...
@Zigmanfreud @Isikoff Why would Mueller show all his cards this early on? It’s primarily a counterintelligence investigation. And there’s a long way to go.

It actually worked against Flynn. Judge Sullivan asked Flynn's lawyers how implying that he was entrapped was consistent with Flynn's accepting responsibility for his crime.

Flynn sentencing has again been delayed. Sullivan has set a status hearing for March 13.
Wow. Flynn's lawyer said he is prepared to take Judge Sullivan up on his offer to delay the sentencing until after Flynn's cooperation with the government, particularly in the EDVA case, is fully over.
@lexikav He was hesitant to respond because it is such a weighty question but he indicated that the question of treason had entered prosecutors' minds, even if they never considered charging Flynn with it.
Judge Sullivan also asked prosecutor Brandon Van Grack whether Flynn's conduct (promising to revisit/undo the sanctions that had just been imposed by the US in response to Russia's attack on the election) rised to the level of treason. So, there's that.
Flynn had seemed confident up until this point, refusing the judge's many offers to allow him to consult with his lawyers. After these harsh words, though, Flynn surprised the room and said "yes" when asked again if he wanted a recess. Court returns at 12:30 https://t.co/QgMqeTLOIp

Flynn’s lawyer Robert Kelner made it pretty clear in 2017 that Flynn wasn't going to take a bullet for Trump. “General Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it," Kelner said, while trying unsuccessfully to negotiate immunity deals with Congress.
Flynn's substantial cooperation with Mueller supports the theory that he lied to the FBI to begin with not out of loyalty to Trump but for self-preservation—by the time the bureau came knocking, he was engaged in clandestine dealings w/ Turkey, Russia, KSA https://t.co/Wf9bCAjyA9 https://t.co/SerKx28bIh
Trump has been urging his associates to have "guts" and not cooperate in the Russia probe. But Mueller sent a clear message tonight to current/future witnesses: testify honestly and completely, and you could be spared prison time. https://t.co/Wf9bCAjyA9
Mueller on Flynn: "Given the defendant’s substantial assistance and other considerations set	forth below, a sentence at the low end of the guideline range—including a sentence that does not impose a term of incarceration—is appropriate and warranted."

@markyzaguirre Definitely. But on top of all the rhetoric, replacing a recused loyalist with a not-recused one who’s shown so much obvious bias was arguably Trump’s most brazen act of interference yet—saying he’s been hands-off in the more literal sense is more impossible now than ever.
Federalist Society’s Leonard Leo tells Axios that Trump hasn’t “acted” on his criticisms of FBI/DOJ even though he effectively forced Sessions out, bypassed Rosenstein, and installed a not-recused loyalist who’s criticized Mueller and was the White House’s “eyes and ears” at DOJ. https://t.co/HRPetYjMDr

Coats says the INF (Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces) treaty "was discussed" in the private Trump-Putin meeting. But says he doesn't know what came of it, or any of the details.
.@mitchellreports: "We have some breaking news. Vladimir Putin is coming to the White House in the fall."	Dan Coats: "Say again?"
Russia waged a chemical weapons attack that killed a person on the soil of our closest ally. DNI Coats just warned that “there’s a risk” the same thing could happen here. And Putin gets an invitation to Washington. https://t.co/aOCUqpxhW1
Coats says “that’s a place I don’t generally go to publicly” when asked whether he’s ever thought about resigning. But, like Wray yesterday, he doesn’t say “no.”
Coats says “it’s a risk” that Russia could wage a similar attack against defectors, critics in the US as it did in Britain with novichok.
clarifying — Coats says he did not know beforehand that Sergei Kislyak and Sergei Lavrov would go into the Oval Office with Trump last May, where Trump reportedly said that firing Comey had taken “great pressure” off of him.

More Coats: "The very pillar of democracy is the ability to have confidence that your leaders were elected legitimately." #AspenSecurity

Unreal. Asked whether he would hold Russia accountable for literally anything, Trump DOES NOT MENTION GEORGIA, MH-17, CRIMEA, UKRAINE, OR ELECTION INTERFERENCE. Says the US and Russia have "both" been "foolish," we've "both made mistakes." Then discusses his election victory.
Trump corrects journalist, says he called Putin a “competitor”—which he considers a “compliment”—not an “adversary.”
Trump says he and Putin "spent a great deal of time talking about" Russia's election interference. "Putin feels very strongly about it and he has an interesting idea." ...what?
Hmm. Trump just now on the US and Russia: "Our nations fought alongside one another in the second World War." https://t.co/ON93XRrsCU

@jedshug Thanks Jed!
To sum up: Vekselberg was allegedly bankrolling the promotion of a plan that involved lifting RU sanctions. Michael Cohen met w/Vekselberg, delivered the plan to Flynn (though he now denies it), started getting paid by Vekselberg’s US fund soon thereafter. https://t.co/1UC08lljVU
Recall that Vekselberg’s US fund, Columbus Nova, began paying Michael Cohen shortly after the “peace plan” meeting. Cohen &amp; his attorney didn’t respond when asked whether the $$ was connected to Cohen promoting the plan, which involved lifting Russia sanctions. https://t.co/ofWXRJRfng
Weldon has known Artemenko for over a decade &amp; was furious that NYT exposed the "peace plan."  “We were so close,” Weldon complained, per source. "We had already secured funding for the promotion of the plan from Viktor Vekselberg’s fund in New York City.” https://t.co/1UC08lljVU
