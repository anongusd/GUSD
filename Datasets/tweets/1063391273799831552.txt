@fattoquotidiano Salvini razzista? Quando l’Europa antisemita finanzia i terroristi palestinesi di Hamas?! Ci si dovrebbe decidere una volta per tutte sul razzismo. Perché mi pare di capire ,che per la sinistra il razzismo viaggia in un unica direzione. Quando poi la sinistra é antisemita.
From Discover on Google https://t.co/3A7C4olzfG is not said is that Salvini is not the only one who governs Italy,but there is also the 5-star party. How do you write similar things? Then Salvini Do Racist?!When antisemitic Europe finances the Palestinian terrorists of Hamas
@matteosalvinimi Quello se lo vai a far guadagnare bene, vedi come corre sul carro della lega. Tutta questa gente di sinistra,cosi salottiera,che sembrano schifare il denaro. Questa gente di sinistra sono i piu attaccati al denaro,ma solo per loro. É da tanti anni che prendono in giro la gente.

@Crunk5454 @heavyduti 👍👍👍👍All the criminal ideologies derive from Socialism. Nazism,fascism,communism ,are branches of Socialism. And all have Supergovernment in their program. Because in all dictatorship ,so many officials are needed ,to be able to control society.
@matteosalvinimi Per i trafficanti di esseri umani sarà una debacle. Chissa cos’altro andranno a trovare,questi individui, per fare soldi.
@matteosalvinimi @_Carabinieri_ E c’é gente che poi li difende. Una persona onesta,  non puo approvare che gente simile possano far parte della società civile. C’é una sorta di compassione socialista per i criminali, che certo non puo essere priva di certi interessi.

@JackPosobiec This is why we, liberals of the right,on so many things,are close to the conservatives. The only thing is, that we are not believers. But we respect each other’s beliefs , because we are for self-determination of each one.
@JackPosobiec In fact I am right-wing liberal,100% for capitalism,for a free society with few rules and a very limited government. The liberals are not all leftists. Be very careful because there are different schools. In Europe the liberals are more to the right,as well as in Brasil.

@sara80elmi @fattoquotidiano Parliamoci chiaro,voi pensate al bene dei Rom o di altri,io penso al bene dei cittadini italiani onesti. Dopo di che potete trarre le vostre conclusioni.
@sara80elmi @fattoquotidiano Non capisco perché il cittadino, in ogni caso, debba sacrificarsi per i vostri problemi di coscienza. Libertà vuol dire anche ,poter uscire tranquillamente ,senza il pericolo ,di essere aggrediti, non tutti possono permettersi una guardia del corpo. Credo che siamo in disaccordo.
@sara80elmi @fattoquotidiano A questo punto se serve piu vigilanza, e mettere ad ogni angolo di strada un poliziotto, mi chiedo solo in che paese lei vorrebbe vivere. Non sarebbe meglio piuttosto prevenire queste situazioni, integrando con le buone o con le cattive i Rom?
@matteosalvinimi Noo, scherzi!! Sono antifascisti!! Quelli che ammazzerebbero tutti i presunti fascisti, cioé tutti quelli che non la pensano come loro. Fascisti=Antifascisti, stessi dittatori di merda, stessi criminali.
@matteosalvinimi Certo, é questo a cui pensano. Ai soldi!! Se qualche sprovveduto non avesse capito. Tutta la questione si fonda sul denaro, e di come ,per questo,approntare una commedia umanitaristica, per poi nascondere i veri fini.
@fattoquotidiano Certo che,senza atteggiamenti ipocriti,questi rom non sono certo degli angioletti. Tutti vedono e sanno,alcuni fingono di non vedere,per motivi politici. Certo che i bambini dei Rom vengono formati per compiere anche dei furtarelli. Dopo di che possiamo fingere che non sia cosi.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @suzydymna Do not you realize that something bad is coming in the United States? Dostoyevsky,in his book, the Demons,he had foreseen something similar for Russia.

@matteosalvinimi Quando un politico viene eletto, e porta avanti un abuso di potere nei confronti dei propri cittadini, incarcerando gli oppositori e assassinandoli, quando un simile dittatore si appropria di tutti i beni dello stato e dei cittadini. I cittadini hanno il diritto alla ribellione.

@matteosalvinimi Questi di sinistra sono dentro affari sporchi. Mi fanno ridere quando attaccano quelli che sono nel mondo degli affari , e che amano farsi i soldi in modo pulito. Quando loro sono i peggiori affaristi,ipocriti, che fanno affari si, ma in modo sporco, e dietro le quinte.
@SecPompeo @PDVSA Prohibit all kinds of Socialism in the United States. Enough with these harmful and criminal regimes. We have already had significant evidence from history,these people are a gang of criminals.

@matteosalvinimi La conoscete la storia dei fascisti che caduto il fascismo,poi, sono diventati comunisti? 😂Gli stessi che poi vedevano la libertà dove non c’era,cioé al di là del muro di Berlino. E che vedevano la dittatura nei paesi dove, loro, comunisti, potevano dire di essere comunisti.😂

@DFBHarvard Now even the New York Jews will have their anti-Semitic ,so they will get bored less.
@realDonaldTrump The media are the servants of the big companies,who would like to return,as in days of Obama,to manage the United States,and to do against the Middle Class and medium and small businesses. The big companies want the whole market just for them and so they buy State Officials.

@patriot_loves @SaveOur1st The Democratic Party has become an Anti-Semitic Party. He has nothing liberal,these people who play Kennedians,they are just Socialists.
@houstonusa6 @ShirleyRinguet5 @LaylaAlisha11 Exactly. Democrats are becoming a Nazi Party. We remember that Hitler was Socialist.

You who call yourself a democratic party,how can you not understand this? Freedom of thought and speech is an important foundation of constitutional law.  Or you call yourself a Democratic Party,when you should call yourself a Socialist party?
In dictatorships there is no freedom of thought and speech. In the dictatorships, whose dissent ,to you of the democratic party, are killed or they are persecuted.
Freedom of thought and speech is an important foundation of a civil  and democratic society. Criticism and dissent help humanity to progress. It is shame that one who directs a university does not understand it. Unusual books are forbidden in dictatorship.
And finally,if some students believe more in arguments based on ideologies,and who do not respect the freedom of thought and speech. What will they serve in the future? They will be bad teachers ,useless to society.

@RudyGiuliani @frodo3245 Now then that the party of investigations has the congress, they will still produce a lot of useless paper,for the joy of their voters.
@InGodIDoTrust @CavalerieJohn I have never seen a socialist who does not impose rules on society. Many of them live in luxury and aspire to keep the others in misery. Moreover , to be socialist nowadays we must have a lot of bad faith. With all the horrible things they’ve done in the past.
@QTAnon1 @quippingalong At least it’s one that life enjoys, Hawaii!! And in the meantime I think of those who voted democratic!!!😂😂😂
@awlatlanta Great Tucker!!!❤️❤️❤️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
The end of the party of chemotherapy, stupid and disastrous care!!! https://t.co/pbwTUgNj1q
@PDChina The party ended for the big companies. That make money on people’s skin,together with the bureaucrats corrupt. The body must be strengthened not weakened with chemotherapy. I’m happy for that!! I’ve been supporting this for many years. It’s only the beginning!!
@Education4Libs Will she always be so beautiful?😂😂😂
Happy New Year United States🇺🇸🇺🇸🎉🎊🎉🎊⚡️❤️ https://t.co/VATcio7jjV
Happy new year, all the best United States. And many positive thoughts for our beloved President Trump❤️❤️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 https://t.co/4MZjn7Cvof
Mussolini before founding fascism was a socialist as well as Hitler,remember this!!
@realDonaldTrump Yes,they go to Hawaii, who knows if they also bring there the illegal immigrants?
As my beloved John Adams said.
My friends ,if I have an idea,I carry it forward,because I believe in what I write. Because that’s how we have to be,sincere and loyal ,not hiding trying to make the fakes, I’m a right-wing liberal,for Trump at 100%,capitalism,free society with a few rules#MAGAROLLERCOASTER
@SebGorka They do not know what to say anymore. The next will be the poor vampires,then the werewolfes and so on. Will they also do séances?
@realDonaldTrump @BeachCity55 Wow!!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🎉🎉🎊🎊
@Jenn198523 Socialists,national-socialists,real socialism(communism),international socialists. Have you ever heard that one of these shits worked in history? Yeah! They are liberals with the sickle and hammer in the soul. They no longer knew where to go and go into liberalism,ruining!!

@bschwarz48 @Lmchristi1 Nobody has the right to violate the laws. Otherwise it would become the Banana Republic. The responsability of foreign children is not the responsability of the United States. But of those parents who obliged these children to violate the laws of a State.
@fattoquotidiano E’ quello che stava accadendo in Stati Uniti con la Clinton. Queste big Company hanno assunto delle misure gigantesche , che oramai possono mettersi in tasca gli stati.

@realDonaldTrump @rghollandsworth We also extend a merciful veil over the Republicans.
@phillyeaglesfa1 @Barnett20Todd @BreitbartNews But how cute! And I bet the Pelosi ,she will use her money,not that of American taxpayers. And will she take them all to her house over her Wall?
Fortunately there is Trump,otherwise what would have been the political program of the Republicans? It would have been a weak program linked to the Status Quo.
@ABC7News An impressive stupidity!
The social state of Hitler. In practice,an organized robbery against of Jews,homosexuals and etnics minorities present in Germany. After,each invading country would steal all its wealth to finance its state,of which the Germans enjoyed the benefits. Socialism,a gang of thieves. https://t.co/bATlWdlePn

@GOP Or the democrats are obliged for other reasons unknown to us💰💰💰💰💰. Impossible that they are only ideological reasons. Schumer and Pelosi ideological? Those think more about money than many others. Who does not want Trump at the White House?

@TomFitton @JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump Exactly! Someone would not want you to go and see inside the Clinton business. Probably you would find out many other interesting things!

@matteosalvinimi Ma chi se ne frega cosa sono!!! Che popolo di gente pesante siete!! Io invece chiederei a Matteo di preparare un bel programma ultra-liberale per le prossime elezioni. Perche’ in Italia c’e’ troppa gente che si fa’ mantenere. Vedi di smantellare tutto quello stato parassitario.
@unscriptedmike @grege1953 Besides being very beautiful she is also smart. This democrats do not forgive her.
@thehill Who knows how the pharmaceutical companies pay him. One have to be fools for not understanding what’s underneath...💰💰💰💰
@Varneyco @HeyTammyBruce @cvpayne When I hear the democrats say that the wall does not work! Do they believe that immigrants will pass through? And when they say it’s not moral. Because it’s moral to use taxpayers’  money to care for those people who violate the law? Do not lie democrats,you want open borders!!
@DianeLong22 @CandysOpinions @gatewaypundit I don’t know!If you know Plato, you know that those people in the cave only see shadow,and they believes that the truth is all there.

@LionelMedia @danaswenson007 Strange,and according you what could be?
@DianeLong22 @CandysOpinions @gatewaypundit Because the democrats make fun of the American people.

@jnottah @truckershdetree That the citizens of the New York State are seeing it now with their increase taxes. Good luck!!😂😂😂
@SealeyGerald @silver_fox9 👍👍👍🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
@commonsenseQano @ctzen66 Some politicians are unworthy, and not a good example to follow. In Schumer , hatred prevails over Trump rather than duty towards his country. Trump takes him away from the scene and he can not stand it. Schumer has already lost?
@donaldtrumpforc @grh4345 What else would be remarkable!
Go back to the basics! Small government ,few rules and small taxes.The first I would eliminate,the subsidies!! They only serve to keep cronyism(clientelism) ,corruption and immigration! https://t.co/Bmheig3fkI

@DLP0205 @jase_1972 @SebGorka @mannreagan @CNN @MSNBC But my friends ,what do you think of the cartel that supported the Clinton to the presidential elections? Can someone explain me shortly?
@jase_1972 @DLP0205 @SebGorka @mannreagan @CNN @MSNBC 👍👍👍that is true. Otherwise he would make at the White House,the dick?
@DLP0205 @SebGorka @mannreagan @CNN @MSNBC So does it mean to you that she must go unpunished?Strange way to see yours? This means that the democrats have the right not to respect the law.. Terrible!!
@TWIGGY4065 @molly649 Deep state,it is completely corrupt and colluding.
@SebGorka @mannreagan @CNN @MSNBC They speak badly of Trump to protect the crime has committed the Clinton.
@DeplrbleRzistr @BreitbartNews That they start looking at their home,for example the Clinton criminal. That the Nazi left them in their own home!!
If the things that turn on the Clinton were true,deserves to be hanged. And also for the democratic party it would be the end. Maybe one understand why they (democratic party)would like to get rid of Trump.
@Alyssa_Milano Incredible lies that are told. People in bad faith!!

Justice is a difficult thing to manage,not everyone can judge in a balanced way. In history politicians,in most cases,have been deprived of it.
@DICS131294 @amuses Think a little bit about how democrats are more interested in strangers that to people of their country. There ,It’s in Denmark, but the left makes the same policy everywhere. These strangers come to our country and allow themselves to everything

Read this book and you will understand why the democrats want immigrants https://t.co/DRONhAezAJ
@netwrkguy They do not want (big companies)to pay the Americans well. And all the disadvantages of immigration,with their costs,they want to charge you Americans. You pay for this while the big companies take advantages. It is a connected speech!
@netwrkguy They want immigrants to pay them less. Then we can discuss the fact that this big government is a big disaster. But if you Americans do not understand that big companies they want a cheap job....Behind the democrats there are those interests..

@realDonaldTrump @Barnett20Todd And they ,fake news,do not say about Obama’s disastrous in foreign policy? What Obama did against the ISIS?Obama has thrown away US taxpayers’ money, and then sow the mess in North Africa and the Middle East

@PoliticalIslam And to think those on the left would kiss their ass too. These leftists who go to these islamists to talk about human rights!!
@DianeYociss It seems that it is a tradition of the left to betray
@DianeYociss This is why the democrats do not want the wall!!
@DianeYociss In Europe it is the same thing that immigrants take and then pay less
The previous admistrations have thrown away the money of American taxpayers to put mess in the middle east. How much money did you want for all this? And now you do not have any money for the wall? If even Israel has built the wall,it means that the wall serves.
Trump appears and there are fewer taxes( not enough, but is good start),fewer rules, less illegal immigrations. This is reality are not ideological bales.
Appears Obama and I wonder what he did for the middle class,he has increased taxes,rules,obamacare which is a total disaster

@Saminsunderland @cujo1000 That guy is the typical sold
Schumer go to defend the interests of big companies,big companies are on your side, side of democrats. + immigrants it is equal to low-cost work. Why do not you go on saying this too? https://t.co/dwhAgPjQEg
Not interested in fanatics of any color, please stay away from me.  As I am anti-communist I am also anti-Nazi. I’m here for Trump,I believe in Him and I support Him. Extremists away!
Good Schumer!They will all be grateful to you these big companies. Europe we have the european commission that takes care of it. In the United States , you are the one who makes their interests of the big companies. Dear Schumer you are against the interests of American citizens
@RepMattGaetz @MsAlachuaCounty They will all be grateful to Schumer these big companies.
@CNNSotu @4ourCountry @RandPaul Just one reason, democrats want open borders. Socialists in Europe do the same. Now we know the arguments of the left. They are always the same arguments. How to pay less workers? Let the immigrants enter so we will pay them less. People like Soros will be grateful to Schumer!!
@RealTT2020 He seems like one who has taken Soros lessons
@Tweets4DJT @patriot_mrs Exactly. Thank you for says that!! Otherwise it is not right for others who have to submit to rules rather rigid to enter the United States..
@VoteMarsha @hank_pannell And above all the wall would cost less than keeping all these caravans
I am european but a good friend of the United States
@SteveScalise @tedeschi_ann Yes,a physical barrier is necessary. It costs less the wall than keeping all these caravans.
In Europe to take charge of these immigrants we spend a lot more than 5 billion dollars a year and we do not have walls to protect us.  How many walls can you build instead of keeping immigrants?
@GOP @cujo1000 The subjects of Schumer are not standing. Where would this technology be to stop the caravans? Without the wall the expenses would be unsustainable.
@AnnCoulter @vadum Because are for open borders
If even Israel has built the wall it means that something is needed. I do not see the Israelis throwing the money away.
@DoingRight1 @17Thanq The subjects of Schumer are not standing. Where would this technology be to stop the caravans? Democrats want open borders,do not tell bullshit.
@DeplrbleRzistr @Jenn198523 It also requires understanding. Trump is alone there and many pretend to be friends. But we can see that he is beating like a lion
@codeofvets @GregorySherry5 @BrianKolfage And instead think that there are people who try not to be free😂😂. Someone study ,that ,in Soviet Union others in Germany. They are a little confused people.

@DLMinTX It’s just people looking for a well-paid job. I love the United States, for me they represent the dream of freedom. And of capitalism of optimism. I will not let any opportunist sold, be able to destroy my dream!
@DLMinTX Uour liberals today are left, totally different from those of classical liberalism. These leftist found a shelter,failed communism and socialism,these has now become liberals. Apparently they are not even so original. Who knows, maybe tomorrow they will be socialist conservatives
@DLMinTX Because with us liberalism is right,capitalist and with few rules.  The founding father of the United States,they were part of this current, on expulsion from the 13 colonies of the English monarchy. If you go read John Adams you will be easy to understand.

@NevadaJack2 @FantWest 😂😂😂funny👍
@matteosalvinimi Credo che tu abbia ragione. I giornali devono essere capaci ,da soli, di stare sul mercato. Nessun organismo sovranazionale puo decidere a casa d’altri, non sono eletti da nessuno e che se ne vadano al diavolo. Il concetto di federalismo e’ qualcosa di attualissimo,applichiamolo!

@Varneyco With the mass of incoming migrants, ones should have thought time ago on the wall. If all the Republicans had been like the President,100 of similar walls would have been build. Without losing all this time.
@IngrahamAngle The United States risk becoming that mess that is Europe
@senorrinhatch I have doubts! He could have more. For example, the wall! That moment has passed. And now the congress is in the hands of the Democrats!

@thehill How similar they are!! True?
@DFBHarvard @KimberlyBlunk That is the problem! Politicians spend always to much,for things that citizens do not agree with. But when there is to spend on true security borders!! Then there all the preaches are weeping up!! From that moment since it is something that serves citizens,they are wasted money!
@SebGorka Democrats hide the fact of being racist,but at the right time their nature jumps out. They are racists alternating time,based on their convenience.💰💰💰!!And their impartiality!!! An operetta scene.
@PressSec That the Republicans do their duty. That they stays with their President and his agenda
@matteosalvinimi L’italiano é il popolo della mutua. Vi é un retaggio burino trasmesso dal fascismo e da cui ,non credano,anche quelli di sinistra ne portano un bel bagaglio.
@matteosalvinimi Spero che pero’ sia una materia determinante nel calcolo complessivo dell’anno scolastico. Io amo Cavour ad esempio, ed il suo modo, il suo stile, la sua visione . Purtroppo Cavour mori troppo presto! E l’Italia si compi molto male. É cosi che poi arrivo’ quello della mutua.
@V_of_Europe This is true!
@matteosalvinimi Chissa’ cosa devono dimostrare!
@LadyPatriot81 @dhd68 They are all excuses,the democrats are sold to the multinationals. They want a low labor cost. They are slaveholders
@Fedele233Fedele @BollaPatrizia1 Troppe regole, fatte per proteggere le multinazionali, le quali si mettono in tasca i funzionari .L’europa e’ un sistema contro le piccole e medie imprese, e quindi contro la classe media. Non ci sono complotti nascosti, ma tutto é sotto i nostri occhi. É un disastro!!
@TheHillOpinion I would not ask these questions. In a society with few rules and therefore little government the best wins. Society is much better than what is believed. Those 4 idiots who run around,in a wealthy society would be isolated
@JasparCJ @PaulBurd They all suck. I would add Farage
@americanzionism Most plots are created to spread hatred towards peoples ,because feared. Or of which one is jealous of its ancestral origin. For example,the Germans who had civilization? They tried to copy the Roman Empire😂 disaster . One fear what one does not know and does not understand.
@GOPChairwoman The left is always anti-semitic. Those on the left see the Jews as the quintessence of capitalism. Therefore,for them it is the absolute evil.
@thehill I find him a fantastic President. Unfortunately, people from too much right to the media. But I guess,Trump will regain Presidency
@matteosalvinimi Quelli hanno distrutto l’Italia, se la sono mangiata viva. Ogni tanto cambiavano tutti di nome al partito,ma erano sempre gli stessi. Hanno costruito uno stato gigantesco, che poi ,i soliti loro amici ,dei salotti di sinistra, se lo sono messo in tasca.
@matteosalvinimi In quei luoghi l’ambiente é marcio. Dev’essere il popolo ad iniziare realmente a prendere le distanze da certa gentaglia, e da certe abitudini storiche! Che in molti casi fanno parte del costume nazionale. C’é molta connivenza in certe regioni.
Only one ideal must unite the right today,that of freedom in all its forms🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸.
@slacker_ga01 @ArchKennedy @POTUS It is time for these guys to be followed by minimum and effective antitrust rules. We can not longer leave this power in the hands of a few people. Internet must remain completely free, with more agents on the market.
@matteosalvinimi Nessun ha il diritto di andare a casa d’altri con simili pretese. Il soggiorno e la casa se la devono conquistare con il lavoro ed il sacrificio, come fanno tutti gli italiani. Nessuno ce l’ha con loro, ma ovviamente non possono essere mantenuti dai contribuenti italiani.
We must defend democracy,freedom of thought and speech. Without freedom there is no progress. Without freedom mens are simply a rams than following orders.
@Sweet_PeaBelle @2nd_amndlady The investigations party(the democrats)
@DineshDSouza @GaetaSusan This speaks along about the independence of the media
@chachmalone I think more of a conspiracy
@CesareSacchetti @BollaPatrizia1 Si, loro firmano tutto cio’ che é contro gl’interessi dei cittadini europei. Tra l’altro ,diciamocelo chiaro, non mi sembra molto costituzionale l’affare dell’Onu. A partire dal momento che viola la liberta di pensiero e di parola. Come puo un’accordo simile essere integrato
@americanzionism Because these media are just anti semitic!
@gadlernertweet @lauraboldrini Certa gente dovrebbe scendere dall’alto del suo podio e farsi un’esame di coscienza,se ce l’ha. Non si puo pretendere che ciascun cittadino si esprima in modo appropriato, ciascuno lo fa con i suoi propri mezzi. Voi fate l’aristocratico con il vostro bel tenore di vita!
@LeaveEUOfficial @WestmonsterUK These politicians who fakes.!!They only think about their own interests.
@RudyGiuliani @KimberlyBlunk This is the real conspiracy. Muller should no longer have any credibility. The democrats have organized this whole story very well
@DFBHarvard And then they say the wall cost😂😂😂.They take around the people these democrats
@AlessandroCere7 @tergv2001 É un Europa proprio amata. Con i suoi funzionari corrotti a Brussels!! E che non rispettano i cittadini europei. Questa Europa deve fallire,sarà un bene per tutti noi
@DavidDavisMP @Paul_Waller_62 It’s bullshit! People did not want that mess. Especially dealing with people which has no democratic sensibility to Brussels. This Europe is better than fail,it will be good for everyone.
@thehill Who cares!! The polls do not guess one
@ASimplePatriot That’s right!👍 he is a sold!!
@greggutfeld Really funny😂😂😂
@ChuckCallesto 😂😂😂well! If he will make people laugh like that, it’s worth it to be candid. At least we will have fun listening to his crap😂😂
@matteosalvinimi Fantastico. Anche nessuna necessita’ di compilare moduli complicati che servono a nulla
@EuroGuido @Leavers_Britain Not in the region of Ticino (Italian Part)in South Switzerland,where the authorities are homophobic and anti-semitic.
@GerardBattenMEP @dregredsociety They signed a document that is then unconstitutional, because it does not respect freedom of speech and thought
@Jenn198523 @ArchKennedy I like him. He is trying to remove Italy from the swamp. After so many years of bad and too much government and corruption of the left
@PrisonPlanet It has great merit,it is making Europe Union fail. Continues so!
@andersonDrLJA @hrh2011mo I know that the list of disasters he has done will not end here😂😂😂😂

@realDonaldTrump @RyanZinke The important thing is that we always have you Donald🇺🇸✨and that you can continue in your great work
That priest should be ashamed.  If this boy commited suicide, he certainly did it for reasons, that we can not and can not judge https://t.co/MaFSjs7x5A
@PDeplorablegirl @LOZ41666248 @GOP The thing that most I hate is those who betray. Those who do not have a word.  Unreliable!!This guy
@thehill They are all criminal except them. These people are completely out of mind
@matteosalvinimi Speriamo sia tanto intelligente e pazzescamente coraggiosa come il padre.
@V_of_Europe That asks nothing for its citizens, because he believes he is the owner of France. That shit!!
@matteosalvinimi Questo prova che la sinistra é intollerante. Loro categorizzano, devi stare dentro certi schemi altrimenti sei morto, io li chiamo sempre i fascisti rossi. Mussolini ed Hitler prima di diventare dei dittatori sono stati dei socialisti. Il socialismo é un cancro che si evolve.
@Jim_Jordan @KimberlyBlunk Democrats are simply untrustworthy fakes
@AMErikaNGIRL07 @dregredsociety @USANEWS007 They are simply untrustworthy fakes. When one is tolerant it is always , not in alternate phases. Democrats do not respect freedom of thought
@LeaveEUOfficial Yes ,because European Union is a dictatorship
@trumpovic02 @KatTheHammer1 @MazurikL @skb_sara @LeahR77 @jojoh888 @StacyLStiles @Barnett20Todd @baalter @John_KissMyBot @MissILmom 😂😂😂😂you’re so funny my friend👍👍👍
@realDonaldTrump @peterboykin Those of the left have the right to be homophobic. They have the right to everything, even to investigate bullshit,it’s their political program
@thehill They are comunists,always inside the investigations. Why should the President’s power be limited? He was elected,the citizens will decide, not this « democrats » with their friends of the multinationals
@LeaveEUOfficial Better that you send them to that country, close with Europe and do business with the United States. Europe is a mess,full of rules and without democracy.
@SKYRIDER4538 @trumpovic02 @LeoDiCaprio @algore @SenSanders @TomSteyer @SenWhitehouse @DonnaWR8 @LeahR77 @RealJamesWoods According to the democrats,ecology is equivalent to paying more taxes. A similar program it would require superhuman mental effort
@LaylaAlisha11 @_realBlackTrump From all this it can be deduced what people are.  Send the bill to be paid to the democrats. You will see that they will be happy to pay with their own money
@trumpovic02 @KatTheHammer1 @MazurikL @skb_sara @grizzlemeister @SiddonsDan @ROHLL5 @LeahR77 @jojoh888 @StacyLStiles @MissILmom 😜🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸😂😂😂👍👍👍👍
@YellowRose1776 @_realBlackTrump @NancyPelosi These democrats are talkative. They were elected only to investigate
@matteosalvinimi @jairbolsonaro Non facciamolo per vendetta ma facciamolo per giustizia , anche nei confronti di coloro che hanno subito una perdita cara.
@matteosalvinimi Esatto👍
She is pervaded just only by hatred https://t.co/bJ8CJ3tABX
@seanhannity What a bore!! Has nothing else to say?
@matteosalvinimi Eh si perché questi usano categorie per definire un individuo. Se non la si pensa come loro si e’ razzisti e fascisti. In tal caso si potrebbe dire di loro ,che certamente hanno poco da insegnare in fatto di democrazia.
@KimberlyBlunk @EinsteinMaga @lorrainekaack @POTUS @GenFlynn @WhiteHouse @SebGorka @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump They cry in rage
@WhiteHouse He’s making bad fools. But it must respect the commitments it has made with the multinationals,otherwise those no longer finance the democratic party
@dbongino He’s right,they’re going to hell
@guypbenson This socialists want to find an argument, to imprison those who have been elected by the people. This extremism is new to the United States,they will never accept that the people can decide who to elect. In truth this new class on the left is much more dangerous of what you think
@usminority According to the democrats gays should be on the left. As well as blacks,yellows,reds...  In short ,they want to cage everyone
@GOP @LindseyGrahamSC But what did these democrats have smoked?
@guypbenson @michaeljknowles 👏👏👏👏👍👌
@V_of_Europe That’s the voice of the multinationals. It would be these people now to throw it out of the buttom rooms. They are slaveholders!!
@realDonaldTrump Once President Clinton said that democrats are stupid people..That is!!
@realDonaldTrump The bosses of the democratic party: Besoz,Bloomberg and Soros...That is,those who want immigrants as a low-cost workforce
@realDonaldTrump This guy has a lot to hide,he’s a man from Obama. That guy knows a lot of things
@matteosalvinimi Esatto,e’ l’unico paese democratico dell’area,mentre quelli della sinistra ,antisemiti,sostengono quelli della sharia.
@CoachBeth47 This Schiff is a falsehood
@darrengrimes_ @nissych5 In fact what can Brussels do,bomb England? Then i do not understand ,but it is not better to do business with the United States instead of those peasant of europeans,all on the verge of bankruptcy?
@realDonaldTrump Many like to imagine ,when it is convenient for them,stories of plots that do not exist. Then the real scandals remain hidden. For example the Clinton Foundation

The truth does not need to be complicated until the paradox, it’s all a set of lies
@GOPChairwoman @SebGorka @realDonaldTrump People paid by the big companies hide this,the media bought. Russia’s case has become something disproportionate. It would be funny to hear the news about the investigations around the russia case. Every season the history change, which evolves like a cancer.😂😂😂
@matteosalvinimi Complimenti per la manifestazione di ieri, non avrei mai pensato che gli italiani potessero aver capito le questioni sul tappeto. Ed inoltre credo che tu abbia meritato questo grande successo,e quindi cio’ dimostra che sei un grande leader.
@leonesl @realDonaldTrump Yes,with a completely corrupt state apparatus. Where the people of Obama wallowed in it
@trustrestored @Barnett20Todd Maybe they are not democratic
@realDonaldTrump Mister President respond to stupid people is wasted energy and time. Many people carry only smoky prejudicial arguments against you. True dictators put the rules and expand the control of the state on citizens. On the contrary you have removed the rules and made the citizens free
Respond to stupid is wasted energy and time. To those one who create niche or they ghetto! Is it looking for freedom this? Or is it an alibi? Trump signed the order n 7,period!
@Nigel_Farage @jakelew75666768 Europe Peoples rebel against European Tyranny🇬🇧🇮🇹🇫🇷
Peoples rebel against European tyranny
@JacobAWohl Exactly!!
@PatriotDarkSoul Unfortunately in Europe in many events, there are fanatics they insert, the media highlight these incidents to discredit the protest. But the malaise among European citizens is general
@MarkACollett Yes, Europeans no longer have any rights. European politicians tell their citizens “ pay taxes and close your mouth,breed of donkeys”. While the Brussels man guy drunkard suffers from commercial contamination💰💰💰
@festus66 This woman of a falsehood? i do not understand how so many people could believe she
@Spuds71339062 @stephphilip8 They want to silence the opposition,removing the freedom of speech and thought, that of the UN is just the beginning towards the world dictatorship

@GaetaSusan @EinsteinMaga @realDonaldTrump @geohays They thought of winning them but then they lost. They lost even with the votes of the illegal aliens. This democrats have never accepted it,together the big companies that hold the media. They could no longer do business behind the americans citizens
There is no history that holds,a dictatorship that is either right or left it’s always a tragedy. Less government possible!!
@ernie_plumley @Skinnym16826163 She is learning by heart the Soros lesson that he gave she
@ChuckCallesto For this bureaucracy woman with oligarchical aspirations ,it is only allowed to speak well of her and her socialism
@NancyJKoch @ArchKennedy An illiterate in addition to the congress
@SecPompeo We Europeans should be grateful to you Americans. You have freed us from dictatorships. Unfortunately there is no gratitude!!
This video sums up the real world problem https://t.co/6lieIVCNKg
@The_Trump_Train @CoachBeth47 Exactly. Which them welcome these immigrants in their sumptuous villas. Why the americans people should pay for the whims of these bored rich?
@SebGorka Intelligent people understood. Then,they turn a little naive ,who believe that donkeys fly. But Muller on the contrary has his feet on the ground and he knows very well that he is pursuing a political action
@realDonaldTrump Incredible!! Perhaps because they can not wait for the americans  to leave.  So they return to make their crap
@jujube23 @stephphilip8 The best wins,this is right. Competition advances the human being. But the state must  light,with few rules,few tasex. And a greater guaranteeism that not allow him (the State)to enter in citizens businesses. Antitrust for big company
@realDonaldTrump @trish_regan That’s why i think it must be fired. It is a danger to democracy

@matteosalvinimi E meno male!! Poveri francesi che se lo devono sorbire
@matteosalvinimi Sono sempre del parere che lo stato deve stare assolutamente dalla parte del cittadino onesto. Non ci sono ideologie che tengono a giustificare simili storie. E non e’ colpa della societa se girano individui simili,ciascuno e’ responsabile delle proprie azioni
@stephphilip8 The family of socialism includes:socialists,communists,national-socialists and fascists. Afterwards they make smoky speeches about their differences,non-existent. In the history their all appear as a gang of criminals
@PradRachael @DoingRight1 Fantastic!!
@AccuracyInMedia What can you say? It’s better if she go back to study!!
@JacobAWohl The typical socialist voted to become an oligarch
@politicalHEDGE Their fraud(of the democrats)should be investigated
@RealBasedMAGA The difference between the family Trump and the others is obvious.
@JacobAWohl They were Europeans, the democrats would have done everything to close the borders
@JeffFlake Why? To go on doing politics? Why the Americans should continue to spend money to hide the trash of Clinton and Obama? Muller is there for this
@americanzionism UN it is an anti-semitic institution
@AmyMek @jakelew75666768 Afterwardswe have tha comunists and the socialists. That would like to teach us this kind of tolerance,with smoky topics
@matteosalvinimi Lo stato deve essere laico ed occuparsi del benessere dei cittadini e cosi della loro sicurezza. Cosa della quale i catto-comunisti se ne sono sempre fregati
@matteosalvinimi Ma che vada al diavolo questo tirapiedi
@RealBasedMAGA I love Trump,really is the best!!!👍👍👍🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
@Nigel_Farage If I had been English I would have certainly signed🇬🇧
@americanzionism @TimesofIsrael Finally socialism turns into nazism.
@LJC2114 The best thing is to leave the freedom of choice to the public. No censorship, because when it starts then it becomes terrible.
@LJC2114 Otherwise what kind of artists would they be. At this point it would be better for priests or politicians to go
@LJC2114 It seems to me that it is exaggerating. Artistic phenomena can not be censored just only for ideological reasons or common morality.
@realDonaldTrump The chinese people have much more to lose. But close the American Universities to them🇺🇸🇺🇸
@matteosalvinimi Mi raccomando, non farti comprare. Quelli ci staranno provando. Quello che stai facendo e’ fantastico!!!
@RealJamesWoods Ridiculous! The wisest thing would be to leave, without useless gestures
@Nigel_Farage @stephphilip8 Nothing new in Europe. It is a continent that always tend towards dictatorships. Perhaps it would be better not to join it, too dangerous
@RepJoeKennedy To many rules are leading to the end of capitalism. The money spent by the citizens is better spent. States can be bought by big companies,therefore unreliable.
@PatriotDarkSoul That false person!!Obama has destroyed the United States
@seanhannity When I think of the mess made by the democrats on the fake case of Trump-Russia,this they did to cover the real scandal,that of Clinton
@DineshDSouza Yes,this is the point about freedom
@V_of_Europe @stephphilip8 It must be the union of civil and democratic countries,not the mix of civil countries with backward countries. Certain retrograd mentalities can not be accepted
@AmyMek The vision of freedom on the part of the democrats!! I say then the democratic and modern tecnological society can not accept to return to the middle ages
@hredriders @stephphilip8 The most amazing thing is that the church considers its affiliates ,people without sex. Is this possible for human nature? It does not lead all this to deviant behavior like pedophilia?
@eu_anti_corrupt More rules and more laws we will have and more corruption will be manifest.  The economic powers can buy the states. States can not be trusted
@CampusHateWatch When will we free ourselves from these remnants of the ninenteenth century?
@Nigel_Farage Macron is so loved by his people,that maybe one day they will do a dedication to Luis XVI.
@matteosalvinimi Che stanno in ufficio, o controllano chi non devono. Non stimo le forze dell’ordine italiane. Li ho sempre visti passare davanti ad ogni tipo di mercato illegale,dove si vendono copie,senza che prestino attenzione. Sono solerti a far rispettare il punto e la virgola agli italiani
@matteosalvinimi Hanno bisogno di mano d’opera a basso costo,insomma schiavi, per la raccolta dei pomodori. Chissa questo qui da chi é stato pagato e quanto l’hanno pagato!
@Don_Vito_08 @EinsteinMaga By dint of swing she has entered  a confusing state. That why she loves big companies ,because there she can keep his eyes on the cash
@IvankaTrump The problem today is the UN. This wants to appropriate the world migration policy,this could have disastrous consequences on the political and social level. It is not possible for an authority of unelected people to decide for such important things
@Jenn198523 @PaulBurd It is a real misfortune.
@Justsaytruthnow @fortressfin @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Maybe these are friends of Google,Facebook,Amazon...In short,the other rich, the only ones who have the right to be so
@AmyMek German is the people of moral falsity. No people in Europe can lie better than the German people
@PatriotDarkSoul I love the United States and the people of the United States because they are optimistic. The worst enemy of a country and a people is its pessimism. This last is the beginning of the end
@americanzionism @benshapiro The liberals?😂 these socialists no longer know how to be called. But they are always the same anti-semitic communists,nazis and fascists.
@DineshDSouza @GIJoeOPS @realDonaldTrump But the Republicans sleep, and they get fucked continuously.
@PatriotDarkSoul The President Trump is very smart,don’t worry👍🇺🇸
@BathNESUKIP Finally a politician with bales in Europe
@PatriotDarkSoul I would like too, but I understand is more easy to says that to do
@matteosalvinimi Gl’italiani decidono da chi essere governati,non una minoranza di fanatici ideologizzati
@DFBHarvard I hope the Republicans follow the Trump program,and that there are no traitors sold,to the Senate of the United States
@matteosalvinimi Perché tra i fascisti ed i comunisti , chi ha fatto piu morti ? Io sono per il liberalismo e secondo me ogni dittatura e’ una tragedia , é regresso della società. Ma le società progredite hanno delle leggi,dei modi di vivere,e non possono essere sovvertiti per motivi ideologici
@realDonaldTrump So much argentineans people are masters in making copies
RT @TizianiMauro: How can Europe be a democracy with history of a country like Germany? Who commands Europe? But Germany obviously. When I…
@AmyMek They are showing their true face. It always starts with limiting freedom of speech and thought. Later they will pass to the most violent acts,which we already see in France
@matteosalvinimi Mi sembrano affermazioni patetiche,non contribuiscono alla promozione delle liberta’ individuali
How can Europe be a democracy with history of a country like Germany? Who commands Europe? But Germany obviously. When I think of the ruling classes of whole Europe countries are sold to German politics! Dictatorship is inevitable,and is a characteristic typical of German people
@KayaJones @SebGorka Is one dictatorship,normal
@francescatotolo @tergv2001 Dov’era Mattarella,quando la classe politica e dirigente si mangiava l’Italia. La situazione d’oggi é figlia degli errori del passato. Uno stato gigante come questo, non solo impedisce di manovrare liberamente il sistema,ma lo mette in serio pericolo fallimentare
@Nigel_Farage Fantastic! I hope it’s someone like you to drive great britain
@ernie_plumley @fortressfin Are criminals. It is no longer a democratic party. They who talk about constitution are coming out of this
@DineshDSouza @jack Trump was elected by the American people.
@bbcquestiontime @BathNESUKIP It depends on whether money or freedom is more important for the British
@benshapiro I’m reading Tucker Carlson’s book,and i find it balanced,absolutely not extremist
@matteosalvinimi Esatto,la democrazia e’ questa, sono i cittadini italiani che decidono chi possono far entrare nel loro paese. L’Italia e’ degli italiani
@matteosalvinimi Non riuscirai,impossibile,troppi interessi,quelli non molleranno
@matteosalvinimi Io penso meno stato possibile,meno tasse,meno funzionari , e di conseguenza meno corruzione e meno mafia. Societa’ libera con poche regole . Ma questo non sara’ mai nella mentalita’ degli italiani
@PatriotDarkSoul And they leave scary buildings where people live there like ants https://t.co/T90kb9cSdj
The right must wake up,you can not leave all culture on the left
@PatriotDarkSoul While the right thinks about business,the left thinks of occupying the culture. They are called the intellectuals of the left. But have you ever seen a socialist regime creating culture?
@ChuckCallesto This woman does not think that statement could it be interpreted in the sense of racism?
@EinsteinMaga @BreitbartNews They believes in the recommended and the guys with square asses,meritocracy is a crime for them. They prefer feudalism
@GOP @realDonaldTrump The free world must be grateful to the President Trump. Because if the United States were to become like Europe, it would be a tragedy for the progress of mankind.

@matteosalvinimi Che vadano al diavolo tutte queste organizzazioni social comuniste ed antisemite
@MarkACollett Macron france today is a shameful thing. And after all that he is doing he allows himself to give lessons
@GOP Now,however,we hope they to carry on the Trump program. Less government,less taxes and less rules. All this means less corruption
@Bud_Doggin @leftovergravy Obama has ruined the United States. He left a country full of corrupt in the administrations
@mike_pence @cindyhydesmith @realDonaldTrump I am very happy, she is a strong supporter of President Trump👍👍👍🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
@GOPChairwoman @DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump Better always republican than democratic
That you only trust the President Trump from now on,the others seem politicians attached only to power
@seanhannity @Kintu3 What did you do when you had the congress?
There is still a lot to do. Trump for the second term🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸. Renewing the republican party
Too much bureaucracy ,too many taxes,little economic freedom in the United States.
@chowdallas @EinsteinMaga These democrats are led to defenders of legality when they agreed. In the constitution it is written that who has children can violate the laws?
@DFBHarvard It’s true. The United States no longer takes the brains
I understood that the Americans love Trump a lot. But they do not trust the Republicans,and i think  the American people are right👍
@proffitt_judy @EinsteinMaga I have not yet seen a socialist who is not also anti-semitic. Tell me who of these socialists really is for Israel
@rebecca70369731 The problem with Republicans is that they do not really follow the President Trump. It’ a disgrace
@RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump That’s great. People says that are not democratics. 👍❤️🇺🇸

@GOP @LindseyGrahamSC @cindyhydesmith Do not be fooled by the elections. Beware of fraud!!
Than on the contrary,to come to the United States we must undergo to a series of bureaucratic regulations. Why are we Europeans more stupid?
Frankly i did not understand these democrats. What should these caravan peoples get in? I do not know,they have special qualifications, they are intellectually gifted.What do they have more than us Europeans?
@AlanDersh I value your great legal culture,and your intellectual honesty.
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch I keep saying this🇺🇸
@HLAurora63 @Kintu3 Very well!👍
@_Trumpster @Kintu3 Let’s hope,we Europeans have already had the Soviet Union to the east. And at least the democrats do not return to being a moderate party,i hope that in the future there will not be another Soviet Union,but to the West
All the peoples of Europe united against the dictatorship of Brussels https://t.co/F62NFymTJD

@Nigel_Farage We hope that this dictatorship of Brussels will fail. The Germans pocketed Europe,with that Macron waiter
@TrueLiberal5 You will see that the right man will come at the right time. Surprises are never lacking in history. Sit with a pipe and under the bombs reflect. Then was in this way, today the situations are not so different since then.
@TrueLiberal5 Sometimes difficult decisions are needed. Never give up,Churchill teaches👍
@SebGorka Yeah,true👍
@GOPChairwoman @NBCNews It is time for you to wake up a little you Republicans,and check well if there are electoral frauds.
@marklutchman And this are not liberals.A true liberal respects the ideas of others.
@marklutchman It is nazis reasoning. But between national-socialism and international-socialism lies in the fact ,that one had the gulags and the other one the concentration camps. But the criminal idea does not change.
@Education4Libs @SebGorka In short, the single party. That’s how the democrats see democracy,seasoned with a good dose of socialism,like Venezuela😱
@dbongino Hillary,she is now older and even more acidic😂
@SebGorka @foxandfriends @RCamposDuffy @PeteHegseth @GriffJenkins @FoxNews @FoxNewsInsider @foxnewsalert @foxnewsvideo @foxnewspolitics @FoxNewsResearch That you look at her at her country. Germany today has destroyed Europe.👎

@newtgingrich If we are to live in a world of naive then the first thing is to give up the tax cut and later have a lot of rules. That is the democrats constitution!!😪
@newtgingrich Why do democrats respect the constitution?😂😂😂😂
@seanhannity @dbongino Behind there are criminal organizations and also in the United States ,someone needs labor a low cost. In Europe is the same shit😒
@trish_regan @SebGorka Who knows how much money they have received,from the corporations,this peoples of the left .You should ask them if they are paid to an immigrant?💰
@realDonaldTrump The rascals hate the great ones,it has always been this way since the time of the ancients,it will always be so. But the great remain in the memory of the peoples. You are a great🇺🇸❤️
@SebGorka Will they be more feminist or socialist?
