RT @VP: Thank you @CPAC! Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. Freedom always wins. #CPAC2019 https://t.co/8MKfFzmE0e
RT @jessicadean: Biggest cheers for VP MIke Pence at CPAC came after this line: "America will never be a socialist country."
“Freedom is more generous, more helpful, &amp; more humane than any other social or economic model ever attempted because it is the only philosophy that respects the dignity &amp; worth of every single life &amp; sees every man, woman, and child as made in the image of God.” -@VP https://t.co/g6O8G8pAdt
“The struggle in Venezuela is between dictatorship and democracy, between socialism and freedom.” -@VP #VenezuelaLibre
.@VP: “And the only thing green about the so-called Green New Deal is how much green it’s going to cost taxpayers if we do it: $90 trillion.” 💰 💰 💰
.@VP: “It was freedom, not socialism, that ended slavery, won two world wars, and stands today as a beacon of hope for all the world.”
.@VP: “It was freedom, not socialism, that gave us the most prosperous economy in the history of the world.”

.@VP: “Anti-Semitism is not just wrong; it’s evil. Anti-Semitism must be confronted wherever and whenever it arises, and it must be universally condemned”
“In Iraq &amp; Syria, thanks to the courage of our armed forces &amp; our coalition partners, the ISIS caliphate has been decimated, &amp;our troops have liberated 5 million men, women, &amp; children. The Armed Forces of the U.S. are the greatest force for good in the history of the world” -@VP
Discussing how freedom of religion is under attack, @VP promises: “We will always stand with people of faith &amp; we will always defend the freedom of religion of every American of every faith.”
“@POTUS has appointed more men &amp; women to our federal courts in the last 2 years than any administration in American history – &amp; they are all conservatives, like Justice Neil Gorsuch and Justice Brett Kavanaugh!” -@VP at #CPAC2019
“Democrats say [the crisis on the border] is a manufactured crisis – but the only thing that’s manufactured is their outrage.” -@VP at #CPAC2019
“We’ve already started to build that Wall. And I’ll make you a promise: Before we’re done, we’re going to build it all.” -@VP at #CPAC2019
