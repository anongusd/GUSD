@mrs_smoke @NaomiVolain @Melissamorr1 @CoalitionSafe @drjrocks76 @GabbyGiffords Hi! Hope this is helpful! SHP offers 4 free violence prevention programs to schools and youth orgs. You can see what we offer and the ways here: https://t.co/T15iKTUubP
Thanks to everyone who watched the #BackgroundChecksNow Town Hall on Facebook Live! Let's get these bills passed! #hr8
.@ChrisMurphyCT: "The next 48 hours are crucial, but that's just the beginning. We have to get this bill through the US Senate and that's going to be a heavy lift." #BackgroundChecksNow
.@RepLucyMcBath "Use your voice. If we don't hear from you, we can't advocate for you."
2. Engage with those who don't agree with you, let them know how much you're depending on them to keep you safe		3. Don't just make calls, send postcards, &amp; send tweets and Facebook messages
Tips from @RepLucyMcBath: Here's what you can do to help #HR8 pass this week...		1. Call every representative in your delegation and tell them how much you support #HR8 and gun laws that keep our communities safe
.@JaclynCorin: "The gun violence prevention movement has been propelled forward in the last year and that's because of young people. We know we don't want to have our children grow up in this America with this gun violence epidemic." #BackgroundChecksNow
.@ChrisMurphyCT "In 2017, more people were killed by guns than by cars in this country." #BackgroundChecksNow
.@RepLucyMcBath: "People have begun to really pay attention. As more of these tragedies have happened over the years, you have all the organizations doing statistical research to come up with data that shows our laws are weak and have loopholes in them." #BackgroundChecksNow
"They're just asking for the liberty to grow up." #BackgroundChecksNow
Brenda Mitchell: "I think we're not talking enough about #trauma. When we have communities that are totally traumatized by gun violence, we have traumatized children, that when they go to school, they're praying that they can make it home from school."
.@markbardenSHP "I'd like to see more people talking about the prevention piece of #gunviolence." #BackgroundChecksNow
"Imagine if 97% of people reached out to their legislators and asked them to vote to pass this? There's a real chance to find a holistic solution to this."
.@markbardenSHP "It's a universal problem, it's a public health issue. It effects my family in a rural town's elementary school, and it happened to Brenda's family. And it's going to take all of us to pass this legislation."
"You have to reach out in your communities and find groups, you might not know they exist but they're there and you can get with the people who care about these issues." #BackgroundChecksNow
"Bring this conversation out of the computer screens and talk to people about this, about background checks. And then, organize, mobilize and activate. Create events like these, town halls, contact your elected officials and make sure they know your names."
.@JaclynCorin talking through the best ways to get involve in advocacy: "The first step to getting involved is to do the bare minimum, register to vote and vote if you can. To defeat the gun violence epidemic we need to do way more than just that, and we need to educate others."
RT @sandyhook: WATCH LIVE: #BackgroundChecksNow Town Hall with @ChrisMurphyCT, @markbardenSHP, Brenda Mitchell, David Chipman from @Gifford‚Ä¶
.@ChrisMurphyCT giving the data of what changed after CT instituted universal background checks, and MO repealed theirs. Data here: https://t.co/1SNIx9FcBP
"The single most important law that we can pass that can potentially prevent acts of gun violence is requiring a background check on gun sales." #BackgroundChecksNow
"It is clear to me that our laws are based on punishing people for bad things after they've already occurred, not about preventing them from happening in the first place."
David Chipman from @GiffordsCourage: "It was my job to prevent the things described from happening. I'm here today because that work isn't done."
RT @annieoxidant021: Students are doing their part this week, and every day. Everyone has a job to do to #protectourkids from preventable g‚Ä¶
"We've been supporting this because it makes good sense, now more than 90% of people support this, 97% of people support this. We have the numbers, now we need the action." #BackgroundChecksNow
.@markbardenSHP: "When we first started this, I just assumed, of course everyone has to pass a background check to buy a firearm. If you can go buy a gun out of someone's trunk without even giving your name, what's the point of having a law with a loophole like that?"
.@markbardenSHP: "I keep going back to what the Senator said, these deaths are preventable. Kenneth's death was preventable, Daniel's death was preventable."
.@markbardenSHP: "There is no way to explain the pain of losing a child. There's no way to articulate it. It is a pain that is indescribable, and its forever, permanent." #BackgroundChecksNow
"The crime is on humanity when we have to bury our children. Not our grandparents who live to a nice old age, we're burying children." #BackgroundChecksNow
Brenda Mitchell: "We need to know that #universalbackgroundchecks are necessary."
Brenda Mitchell, who lost her son Kenneth in Chicago: "To lose Kenneth to gun violence, impacts so many things. Kenneth was the center of our family, the oldest grandchild on both sides." #BackgroundChecksNow
.@JaclynCorin: "We activated communities all over the country with over 800 sibling marches around something at common-sense as #gunreform. We've been on this journey over a year now, and we'll continue to build this network of young people." #BackgroundChecksNow
.@JaclynCorin: "I'm here to tell all of you today, if you haven't experienced the pain of #gunviolence, you should do something before you do." #BackgroundChecksNow
.@ChrisMurphyCT: "I would dare to say that we are at the tipping point, this week we will see the real test when the House votes on Universal Background Checks."

can to keep yourself from having to experience it. To make a Promise to hold them in your hearts &amp; take action to stop gun violence today. We have made so much progress together, but there is much to be done. We owe nothing less to those we've lost, &amp; to those we can still save.
For the 17 at MSD, for Dylan, Daniel, and Mary, and for the almost 40,000 other Americans killed by gun violence each year in America. We hope you will find a way to honor them today, to really put yourselves in a survivors shoes. To imagine this day, and then work to do all you
ways, are truly something to behold. With every tear we shed with them, their perseverance and quest for change, for a better life for our children, for a safer future for our families, inspires us to keep pushing forward.
Some tinged with anger, some with sadness, small glimmers of joy and hope some days, others overflowing with determination powered by grief. Our hearts ache today for the parents, siblings, families, friends, and activists in Parkland, but the changes they've inspired, in so many

For too many families in Parkland, today will be about unrelenting loss, endless heartache, and unending love for the people that were stolen from them. It's been one year since their loved ones were shot and killed in their school, what should be a place of learning, friendship,

These are simple acts I can do today for a better tomorrow. This year #IVoted through an absentee ballot because I am traveling to share our Know the Signs programs with new schools and communities.
I #vote for candidates who support Extreme Risk Protection Orders, also called Red Flag Laws, which empower family &amp; law enforcement who recognize at-risk signs in an individual to temporarily separate them from firearms until they are no longer in crisis.
I #vote for candidates that support sensible gun violence prevention efforts, such as funding for schools to implement violence prevention programs (not arming teachers).
My priority issue is #gunviolence prevention, focusing on the human side of gun violence ‚Äì what are we doing to help at-risk individuals get help before they make a tragic choice and how do we ensure safe and appropriate access to firearms.
I #vote for the future Dylan deserved to have.  I vote to ensure a future where other families won‚Äôt experience this senseless, preventable loss. I am not a single-issue voter, nor do I just vote along party lines.
I #vote for candidates that I believe will best serve their constituents and keep our future safe and healthy.  I vote to protect the future of my surviving son who is now 14 years old, and I vote on behalf of my dead son, forever 6 years old.
#WhyIVote from @NicoleHockley: "There are actions each of us can take every day to make this country a better place, and to keep our communities and schools safe.  This is why I have hope ‚Äì and why I #vote.
