Several sources told me Cohen either directly told them he expected a WH job or they heard second-hand he was "begging" for one. They did not provide evidence ‚Äî texts or emails ‚Äî to back up the claim. https://t.co/knWPnkOXBs
Cohen today said he did not want a WH job. Prosecutors said in a sentencing memo: ‚Äú...Cohen privately told friends and colleagues, including in seized text messages, that he expected to be given a prominent role and title in the new administration."	https://t.co/knWPnkOXBs
We have already seen Trump allies focus on one part of Cohen's testimony ‚Äî that he did not want a White House job ‚Äî and we'll likely see more of it, as they continue to portray Cohen broadly as a "convicted liar." My story: https://t.co/knWPnkOXBs
Meadows brought her today to push back on Cohen's testimony calling Trump a racist. In 2016, she talked about her experience as a black, female executive at Trump Org during the campaign and showed a video at the RNC in Cleveland to also push back on racism and sexism charges.
Lynne Patton, a longtime Trump family associate who now has an admin job, was invited to the hearing by Rep. Mark Meadows. She previously served as vice president for the Eric Trump Foundation and also helped plan his wedding.
Rhona Graff, Trump's longtime assistant, has also come up. She was known widely as Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúgatekeeper.‚Äù Here's a 2017 Politico profile on Graff https://t.co/9YakFuUnmc
Also, this 2016 WSJ profile on Weisselberg includes this quote on the Trump-Weisselberg relationship: ‚ÄúIf Donald had a cold, he [Allen] would sneeze.‚Äù https://t.co/VLOZCezmWj
Allen Weisselberg, who has come up a lot today, used to work for Trump‚Äôs father Fred Trump. He‚Äôs held several different positions, including serving as VP of Trump‚Äôs Atlantic City casino, board member of the Miss Universe pageant, and treasurer of the Trump Foundation.
According to a 1993 biography of Trump, Calamari repeatedly responded ‚ÄúYes, sir‚Äù when Trump asked him,‚ÄúWould you kill for me, Matty?‚Äù
Some background on these Trump Org execs that have been coming up: 		Calamari has been one of Trump's most loyal aides. He first got Trump‚Äôs attention while working security at the 1981 U.S. Open, where he ejected hecklers seated near Trump. Trump first hired him as a bodyguard.
New statement from Trump 2020 campaign on Cohen testimony: https://t.co/Z3W08CXMA3
So far, R's main ways to defend Trump w/ their line of q's:	- Cohen wanted a WH job, turned when he didn't get it	- He's to get book/movie deals that will lead to $$	- He's trying to get a reduced sentence	- He's going to prison for lying to Congress, meaning he's not credible
RT @LissandraVilla: Gaetz took some questions, and I asked why he thought twice about the tweet: ‚ÄúI certainly wouldn‚Äôt want anyone to view‚Ä¶
If it wasn't clear already, Republicans will use their time to keep portraying Cohen as a witness who isn't credible and can't be trusted. Rep. Mark Green just called him a "fake witness." "How on earth is this witness credible?"

For Republicans on the judiciary committee, two of Ford's requests ‚Äî the Judge subpoena and her going first at the hearing ‚Äî are non starters, senior GOP staffer tells me. They don't want a witness recommending subpoenas and want Ford to go first so Kavanaugh can respond
Trump also started to say "to take a man like this and besmirch..." about the Kavanaugh allegations before stopping himself and saying "with that being said let her have her say"
Trump agrees with Hannity that he has been "accommodating" of Ford's allegations, but adds: "they've delayed it a week, and they have to get on with it."

Trump asked during hurricane briefing if he believes Cohn and Porter's statements today re: Woodward book. He responds: "You shouldn't be talking about that right now because it doesn't matter." But then he goes on to say that he appreciated the statements.
Trump again calls the Puerto Rico response an "unsung success."
Trump during hurricane briefing is asked about lessons learned from Puerto Rico. He says the response was "incredibly successful."
Sen. Graham, who is basically in every chapter of the book, talked about finding a replacement for McConnell with Bannon, according to Woodward. Graham denied wanting the job for himself.

Also, per Woodward book, Cohn was talking to Trump about the increasing U.S. deficit. "What do you mean? Trump asked. Just run the presses ‚Äî print money."
Per Woodward's book, Trump mangles the name of the movement that helped him win the presidency. "I'm a popularist," he reportedly told Bossie and Bannon, who tried to correct him. "Yeah, yeah. A popularist," Trump said again.

Most red-state Senate races that Republicans view as top pickups are clearly currently missing from this list. For now, it seems the Koch network is willing to act on what it's been saying about its shift in strategy this weekend https://t.co/MyBOp3xKEK
Koch network groups are currently involved in the following seven races in 2018:	Wisconsin Senate	Missouri Senate	Tenn. Senate	Michigan gov	Nevada Gov	Florida (Gov and Senate)	There's been a lot of talk from them about being more selective: https://t.co/MyBOp3xKEK
I just got a clarification on the previous spending Koch network has done against Sen. Heitkamp. "We were pushing Heitkamp to vote for tax reform. With no champion, we will not engage in the election."
In contrast to the ND race, they pointed to Rep. Marsha Blackburn in the Tenn. Senate race as a "policy champion" and said they will continue to be heavily involved there.
After two days of expressing their frustration against GOP, Koch network officials now announcing in the North Dakota Senate race that they "can't support at this time" Rep. Kevin Cramer. (Although they have spent about $500k against Heitkamp). More here: https://t.co/MyBOp3xKEK

Good morning! Here's my wrap from a weekend at the Koch network gathering in Colorado Springs -- A Major Network Of Conservative Donors Is Distancing Itself From The Republican Party https://t.co/MyBOp3Pm3k
On whether Trump bears responsibility for divisiveness in the country, Koch says: ‚ÄúI think we all do...I‚Äôm into hating the sin, not the sinner.‚Äù
Asked if Trump's tariffs/trade war could lead to a recession, Charles Koch tells reporters: "If it's severe enough, it could."
This was the first time Charles Koch has taken questions on-the-record from reporters at a Koch network event, which were opened up to media in 2014
I asked Charles Koch about the GOP supporting a protectionist agenda that goes against what he's advocated for and any regrets in which candidates/party they've backed. He said the Koch network will be "much stricter" in who they back and will "hold people responsible."
Asked if he would be ok with a Democratic-controlled House, Charles Koch tells reporters: "I don't care what initials are in front of or after somebody's name."
Sen. Tim Scott tells donors at Koch network gathering on the challenges of passing legislation: "There are 49 Democrats and about 47 think they're going to be president in 2020."
One example of how Koch network officials have called out Trump today at their gathering of donors in Colorado: https://t.co/U9YDw4No0o
Others Koch network officials today have called out the president for being ‚Äúdivisive‚Äù and doing ‚Äúlong-term damage‚Äù on issue like trade, but Charles Koch mostly stayed away from politics/Trump in his quick remarks
Koch pointed to progress on criminal justice reform and ‚Äúuniting people who had previously been divided‚Äù as examples of the vision that is succeeding

Trump "So how do you like the fact that they had people infiltrating our campaign? Can you imagine that?"

Trump says things changed with North Korea after Kim Jong Un met with Chinese leaders, but he wants to give them the "benefit of the doubt." "Either way, we will be in great shape." "Our people are literally dealing with them right now."
But OGE said in a letter yesterday that it did need to be included as a liability, and while accepting the note for this year's disclosure, passed along the reports to DOJ as it handles complaints about why it wasn't included in last year's report.
Sanders says the reason the Cohen repayment wasn't included in Trump's 2017 financial disclosures is explained in this year's doc. This year's disclosure says that the payment doesn't need to be included as a liability but it was acknowledged in a note for "transparency."
Sanders says Trump was referring to MS13 gang members in his "animal" comment yesterday. "Frankly, I think the term 'animal' doesn't go far enough."

Trump's campaign has paid at least 8 different firms and Trump Corp for legal consulting. This includes firms involved in the Stormy Daniels case.
Trump's 2020 campaign also shelled out about 22 percent of it's total spending so far this year on legal consulting https://t.co/CRxttc4f1V

After being delayed twice, WH press briefing canceled today. WH says its in light of Florida school shooting. "We will inform you as more information is available."
Reporters have been shouting q's about domestic abuse at Trump for days, but this is the first time he has gone beyond praising Porter's work/wishing him well.
Trump, responding to a q at tax cuts event, says he's opposed to domestic violence, adds, "Everyone knows that and it almost wouldn't even have to be said."
Over a week since abuse allegations against Porter were first reported, Trump talks about domestic violence: "I'm totally opposed to domestic violence of any kind."
Trump is currently in a bipartisan meeting on infrastructure because it's infrastructure week, remember?

Another WH briefing focused on Porter questions, another round of non-answers.
On FBI director Wray saying Porter's case was closed in January, Sanders says: "The FBI portion was closed. The White House personnel security office had not finished their process."

Sanders says it's not accurate that WH counsel Don McGahn knew of allegations against Porter last year.
Sanders: "I think the president -- like i said -- supports the victims of any type of domestic violence, but the president also supports due process."
Asked why Trump has not addressed victims, Sanders said: "That's actually not true. He literally dictated that statement to me."

Is the president encouraging a shutdown? Sanders: "The president is encouraging people to do their jobs."
This was corrected by pool. Corrected quotes from Kelly:	Has the president read the Democratic memo?	Kelly: "He has it. It's pretty lengthy."	q. Has he read the whole thing?	Kelly: "No, no, I just gave it to him."
More Trump on shutdown: "I would shut it down over this issue. I can't speak for everybody at the table but I will tell you, I would shut it down over this issue. If we don't straighten out our border, we don't have a country. Without borders we don't have a country."
