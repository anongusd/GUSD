For a generation, Congress responded to gun violence with only thoughts and prayers. But while we prayed, children, churchgoers, and more were murdered by the thousands. Today, for the second time in just one week, House Democrats took decisive action toward ending gun violence.

It’s disappointing that as Congress moved forward with a compromise today, the President insisted on declaring a national emergency because he didn’t get his way. If the President proceeds with this declaration, it will be an abuse of power that will be challenged by Congress.

I’ll let you get back to twitter things, but thanks for reading. Health care is complicated, yes, but it deserves the time and attention to get it right because health care is a right for all, not a privilege for a few.
I appreciate the time people have put into making the State Public Option Act a thoughtful way to expand coverage &amp; lower costs. A special thanks to @ASlavitt with @USofCare for coming out to New Mexico to eat chile and talk about how we can use #MedicaidBuyIn to expand coverage!
We’ve seen tremendous progress around #MedicaidBuyIn in New Mexico. @NMRepArmstrong &amp; Sen. Ortiz y Pino introduced a bill and @NMT4HC is hard at work making it a reality, while @ManattHealth has done research showing that 80,000 New Mexicans would become eligible for coverage.
The State Public Option Act would make real strides in our fight for universal coverage. That’s why 14 states are already considering #MedicaidBuyIn to close coverage gaps and save families money.
The State Public Option Act strengthens women’s health services. Thanks to @AllAboveAll @PPFA @ACLU and others for working with us to make sure abortion care is covered. As we move toward universal coverage, women cannot be left behind.
The State Public Option Act strengthens the Medicaid program. It includes a bump in reimbursement rates for family med, internal med, pediatrics, OB-GYNs, FQHCs, and rural clinics. This bump is not just for the buy-in population. This will increase participation in the program.
The State Public Option Act also increases affordability. This bill fixes the family glitch, making more middle class families eligible for tax credits. People can then take their tax credits and buy a Medicaid plan so no parent has to choose between rent and a doctor’s visit.
The State Public Option Act strengthens the ACA by enabling states to sell Medicaid plans on the exchanges. Does your state have too few plans? Do you worry about your county not having coverage? #MedicaidBuyIn increases competition and decreases cost.
Our State Public Option Act gives states the ability to remove income requirements from Medicaid so anyone can buy a plan. It’s a public option. I’ve supported the public option since I was voting on the ACA in 2010 because I believe that health care is a right, not a privilege.
The ACA, Medicaid expansion, and protections for pre-existing conditions have expanded coverage and lowered prices for millions of Americans. But 30 million people still don’t have coverage. That’s not okay.
Today @SenBrianSchatz and I - with over 50 other Members of the House and Senate - are reintroducing the State Public Option Act, aka #MedicaidBuyIn. This bill expands health coverage and lowers costs.
The President’s failure to get his way on his ridiculous border wall is not an emergency. The only emergency at the border is the humanitarian crisis caused by President Trump himself. Declaring a national emergency now is an abuse of power and a misuse of emergency declarations.

To be clear, the President could have accepted a bipartisan clean Continuing Resolution to prevent a government shutdown back in December. In the days ahead, we will discuss the modern and effective border security measures that Democrats have laid out.
What is most important is that federal workers are going to get paid, services will resume, and local projects can proceed. There was no reason for the American people to suffer for 35 days.

We must have a debate about border security &amp; addressing the humanitarian crisis caused by this administration’s reckless immigration policies. But first, I urge the President to work with Congress on one of the options Democrats have put forward to open the government.
Tonight, the President chose to stoke fear instead of restore certainty for the hundreds of thousands of families who do not know when their next paycheck will come. To govern based on the President’s tantrums is a disservice to the American people.

The U.S. Global Change Research Program’s report makes it clear that the Southwest will face increased drought, wildfires, crop failures, heat stress, and more due to our changing climate. Our forests are already suffering.

Today, an American community is once again mourning the loss of their loved ones as a result of gun violence. Congress must act to end this epidemic before another parent, friend, or family member is confronted with tragedy.

Despite Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation, I won't stop fighting in Congress to protect people’s rights and civil liberties.
In addition, the way Senate Republicans and the Trump administration conducted the confirmation process, which included an incomplete FBI investigation into Dr. Blasey Ford’s serious allegations, was unacceptable. Our country deserves better.
Judge Kavanaugh's most recent, troubling performance before the Senate Judiciary Committee further demonstrated that he does not have the temperament or impartiality to serve as a Supreme Court Justice.
The Senate just confirmed a nominee who is unfit to sit on the highest court of the land. His judicial record makes it clear he will not stand up for the rights of women, environmental justice, and American workers.

Almost 60% of New Mexicans in rural communities and 80% in tribal communities don’t have access to high-speed broadband. I’ve made it my priority to address this imbalance because I believe bridging the digital divide is critical to our economy, our students, and our nation.
Together, we participated in a demonstration of Google’s #RollingStudyHalls, a broadband roundtable discussion, a conversation about the digital divide in New Mexico, and toured Santo Domingo Library and New Mexico State Library https://t.co/u3r0kxjPVk

They have failed again and again to protect children. Congress could have taken action to meaningfully protect children and keep families together. Congress didn’t. Speaker Ryan even blocked a vote on bipartisan legislation to protect Dreamers. Roger and Lea deserve better.
Just last week I was in Brownsville, TX meeting Roger &amp; Lea, babies who'd been torn from their families by the President's immoral family separation policy. The President caused this problem and he has not fixed it. Speaker Ryan and Republican leadership have done no better.

While pursuing diplomacy with North Korea is necessary, if the President is serious about these efforts, he has an obligation to work with our allies to form a clear strategy toward the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

Congress has an obligation to provide unbiased oversight on behalf of the American people. If we don't examine what went wrong it will be impossible to prevent the same type of foreign interference in future elections. Protecting our democracy must not be a partisan issue.
Republicans on the Committee went even further by issuing a report claiming that Russian interference was not aimed at helping President Trump's campaign. This contradicts the firm conclusions of the entire U.S. Intelligence Community.
The American people deserve a full accounting of Russian interference in our election. The House Republicans’ decision to prematurely close the House Intelligence Committee's investigation is a politically motivated attempt suppress the truth.

@Jmajkrzak @DorisMatsui Don't take my word for it: Consumer Reports said in a recent report that the average buyer of a 2015 model-year vehicle spent $523 less on gasoline than for a 2005 vehicle. Fuel efficiency standards = less spent by consumers at the pump.
Proud to join @DorisMatsui as a sponsor of the Clean and Efficient Cars Act, which ensures the Trump Admin can’t rollback important fuel economy &amp; emissions standards, protects public health, the environment and consumers’ bottom line at the pump. https://t.co/7O9dwRT14y

I introduced the federal Medicaid Public Option Act last year because I believe expanding the availability of low-cost, high-quality health plans to all is the right thing to do. I look forward to helping NM navigate the hurdles that exist while crafting the best possible policy.
I'm incredibly grateful that such knowledgeable and dedicated health policy experts were willing to meet with me to help more people in my home state of New Mexico - and hopefully soon all across the country - gain access to quality, affordable healthcare.
I hosted a Medicaid Buy-In Roundtable to bring together @NMLegislature and healthcare policy experts to assist NM in developing a strong Medicaid Buy-In study and connect state officials with national policy experts. https://t.co/WOSv7lDQkD https://t.co/An5B5ripw3

It is vital that Congress take steps on commonsense approaches to ending gun violence. #NeverAgain
I support overturning the Dickey Amendment, which bans the use of federal $ to research the gun violence epidemic and I support measures to prevent people on the terrorist &amp; FBI watch lists from purchasing weapons, to limit magazine size, and to ban bump stocks. #NeverAgain
That's why I cosponsored a ban on future sales of assault weapons and signed a discharge petition to force a vote on legislation to expand background checks and close existing loopholes, including the gun show loophole. #NeverAgain
I’ve heard the voices of students and survivors in FL, in NM, and across the country and I agree with them: #NeverAgain. I support commonsense measures to ensure that our children no longer go to school— or a library, movie theater, or concert—scared for their safety.
Too often senseless acts of gun violence have shaken our nation. From Sandy Hook to Parkland to Aztec these tragedies impact people from all walks of life, every corner of our county, and right here in New Mexico. #NeverAgain
I cosponsored legislation by @USRepMikeDoyle to preserve a free and open internet and overturn the FCC's decision to repeal #netneutrality protections. A free and open internet is essential to a free and open society.

@Idahowifey Glad you asked. I led a bipartisan coalition that passed legislation providing $1 billion for 2 years to help with prevention/ treatment-$10 million to NM. This $ is helpful, but those on the front lines say it’s just a start, so I introduced new bill to fund 5 more years.
President Trump can try to paint himself as the greatest President ever, but firings, resignations, investigations and scandal after scandal have been far too common. At the highest levels, the Trump administration – and the business of the nation – has been seriously hurt. #SOTU

Here’s what POTUS didn’t tell you about his #GOPTaxScam: it explodes the deficit and sticks our children with the bill, while requiring a $25 billion Medicare cut. It will increase your family’s health premiums &amp; gives new tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas. #SOTU
President Trump is praising a #GOPTaxScam that gave 83.1% of the benefits to corporations and the wealthiest one percent of Americans and just 16.9% of the benefits to everyone else. That’s not fair and it just doesn’t add up! #SOTU https://t.co/tDRElCWlkE
