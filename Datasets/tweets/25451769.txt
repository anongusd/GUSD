@jaketapper Congratulations to you and your wife on your wonderful new son!
@marclamonthill Re: Coltrane - A Love Supreme.  Nice to read that you are finally listening to real music!
@LeniPenny O'Reilly is now drawing 3-4 million and beating CBS.  But the broadcast nets always have an advantage with lower channel numbers.
@jaketapper Because of low channel numbers; 2,4, 7 etc, network news will always have natural ratings advantages over cable news.
@LizClaman And if Cal can finally beat USC, the Bears may finally get to the Rose Bowl.
@jaketapper Fox News Sunday airs on Fox broadcast before  NFL pregame show. Obama would be reaching a different audience than FNC.
@LaurenSivan  Re: Obama's Rosh Hashanah greeting. Did he consult with Reverend Wright?
@andylevy Why was Oderus Urungus a no-show on Red Eye last night?  Was he shot by a hunter?

@JonathanHoenig Is Terry Keenan off Cashin' In?  (No mention of her for two weeks).

@brianvickers83  Congratulations on your win @ Michigan.  Some poetic justice after the Nationwide race yesterday.  Did Kyle offer congrats?
@andylevy Giving away the storyline of Mad Men before it airs of the Left Coast may be a good reason to stop following your tweets!
@andylevy I'm finally convinced: Kyle Busch needs to be suspended for at least one Nationwide race.  Every week his behavior is abominable!

Tough 6-hour drive from Bay Area to SoCal; very hot in Central Vly & too many trucks but looking forward to seeing granddaughter and family.
@andylevy Looking forward to Tonight's show. Glad Red Eye is on vacation next week: so am I!  Now I can save 5 hours on my DVR!
@AmandaCarpenter Except for "Ann Coulter" reference, not a bad performance on Huckabee/O'Reilly..
@officervic It is KEN HARRELSON (played for Red Sox & others in the 60s) and Mark Buehrle play-by-play was on Chicago Comcast Sportsnet.
@AlisonRosen It appears that Twitter may have done an old-fashioned hatchet job on everybody's followers.
@DebbieSchlussel  Thanks for the link.  Very enlightening column about Congressman Issa who once ran for California Governor.
@DebbieSchlussel You link to the Glen Beck/Lou Dobbs story doesn't work.
RT @jimgeraghty Post's Tom Shales: 'Barack Obama still seems too good to be true.'"  Oh, that white Southern Liberal guilt!
@marclamonthill Did you give O'Reilly your tie?
@BillHemmer O'Reilly had the right idea at top of "Factor;" similar to Ross Perot with NAFTA, use charts to explain health plan.
@Andy_Bloch Re: Online poker: best of luck in DC (only time I'll ever agree with Barney Frank!)
@officervic Surprised you didn't know about A's historic comeback last night.

@andylevy Is Bill Shulz' brother similar to Gutfeld's brother Gunnar?
@HeyTammyBruce I was not a fan, but in truth the Walter Cronkite role in turning opinion against Vietnam is more fable than fact.
@TweetNFL Sorry to hear about Nelson Munsey's passing.  Loved those Bert Jones led Baltimore Colts teams of the Mid 70s!
@andylevy Glad to see Frangela tonight on Red Eye, thought they were out of the rotation.  How 'bout Sherrod Small & Michelle Collins?
@jimgeraghty Did Cardin also credit Sotomayor with Orioles last place record over past decade????
@OAKRAIDERS  To omit Marcus Allen's 75 yd TD run in SB18 is a disgrace.  Time for Raiders to finally bury hatchet with best all time player.

@HARRISFAULKNER  @tobin smith  I doubt that Lenny Dykstra will be appearing on Bulls & Bears anytime soon.
@marclamonthill  On Hannity, Larry Elder said that best entertainer of all time was not MJ but Sammy Davis Jr. I agree. Maybe U too young!
@andrewbreitbart Bar Mitzvahs?  I thought you were an atheist.  But maybe not when you were 13!!!!
@officervic Monday apparently Suss did not show.  Except for Lee introducing Big Buck and Mike State in your role, it was all "Best Of."
@JennaFryer Forget Michael Jackson. Far too much attention to lousy driver (Michael Waltrip) and non-winning team.  Truex deserves better!
@ShannonSpake Or will they ask "where were you during Michael Waltrip's press conference????
@andylevy I should have asked if you only book SE Cupp on Redeye on the Mondays after Smoke wins!!
@officervic I know you're on vacation but where was Brian Sussman this morning?  Lee (& Ken Berry) must be POed!  Massive KSFO screw-up.
@andylevy  Will you and S. E. Cupp save your Tony Stewart hats until the end of the show!
@stacyLsim Tomorrow you can watch the Michael Jackson Memorial Service!  Take care of yourself.
@JennaFryer I'm now wondering whether Tony Stewart was actually at a disadvantage last year driving Toyotas for JGR.
@andylevy Re: Kyle Busch.  When you are PO'ed, sometimes it is better to say nothing.  Besides he may have had a concussion from that hit.
@tobinsmith Did @ericbolling ever blow out those sparklers without burning down Bulls & Bears studio?  Happy 4th guys!
@KarlRove  Re:Wendell Willkie. I believe that Eisenhower had no political (never an office-holder) experience when he was elected President.

@marclamonthill Sorry Doc but he aint sh*t without that teleprompter!

@BernardGoldberg Didn't you do a Dykstra piece a few years ago?  This must be an update.
@AlexisGlick I don't blame Neil for being angry at Obama not doing Fox interview.  Maybe he would have consented to you instead of Cavuto.
@MajoratWH  Obama also talking to Al Hunt on Bloomberg TV.  Neil Cavuto angry.  If Neil to conservative for Obama, why not Alexis Glick?
@richeisen Matt Millen a great pickup for NFL Network.
@marclamonthill Why are you so angry?  Try throwing a medicine ball! (Do they still have medicine balls?)
@LaurenSivan Are you subbing for @AndyLevy who just told Twitterdom he is calling in sick?
Last night on NBA TV, Kenny Smith said that Kobe Bryant is now on Top 10 list of best players of all-time.  Crazy?  Maybe?  Definitely?
