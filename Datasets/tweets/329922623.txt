The reason trump doesn't like Obama is because Obama killed his idol Ben Layden.
@RealMuckmaker Get out before we throw out.
@naretevduorp His pillow is Crap.
@robreiner Do the people really care ?
Trump is on the side of brutal ditactors because this is how he pictures himself. He's already locked children in cages. What do you think he's going to do when he becomes a full fledged dictator?
@joncoopertweets @TheDemCoalition @mattgaetz how many lowlifes in your gov.?
@krassenstein Execp Lindsey Graham.
@SafetyPinDaily Republicans are going along with him because they have no guts.
The greatest enemy of Democracy today is STUPIDITY.
@ktumulty @PrincessBravato How do you get away with so many lies?
@ABC I  would pray but I don't talk to invisible people. Just seems kind of silly to me.
@SafetyPinDaily you have a lot of stupid people
@SafetyPinDaily Was she born under a Rock?
Remember, when the Gov. shuts down it's the responsibility of the President. The buck stop with him.
@SenateGOP Yea, thanks to Obama.
RT @SethAbramson: I urge ALL DEMOCRATS and ALL REPUBLICANS to add to their calls for Northam's resignation a call for Trump's resignation,…
@politico Show your tax returns.
@BillKristol She just finding that out now ???? dah
@krassenstein Yes and God wanted Sarah and Donald to be liars!
@jilevin yea, he's a ganster.
@bradleyrsimpson The people are catching on to you man. It will soon be all over.
That's an old trick folks, even murderers use it. When you're on your way to prison you suddenly get religion. It's not 'lock her up "anymore. It's "lock him up"
@SafetyPinDaily What a bunch of DICKHEADS !!
Trump shoild put a wall along the Canadian Border. He could get Canada to pay for it.
Gee ,He might even get Canada to pay for it. haha
Please, don't tell Trump that if you put a wall along the Canadain border you could stop all that cold wind .
@GovMikeHuckabee The only thing that stinks is what the Gov. is doing to the American people.
@WhiteHouse It's time for you guys to resign.
My advice to Michael Cohen. Go in front of Congress and spill your guts. Holding a secret puts you in much more danger.
Open the border and let these people in. They will enrich your Country.. Throw out Donald trump and his backers. that will also enrich your Country.
@HuffPostPol Disrespctful brat!  Is this what our future looks like ?
Follow thr Devil. Enjoy the cool-aid.
@RandPaul i would hit that kid so hard his teeth would land in Canada. No respesct anymore. Trump's White America won't work. Follow the devil White America and sooner or later you will have to drink the cool-aid.
@TIME the first onw was so productive lol
@HuffPostPol Are  you  a Christian ,Mike ???????
When my ansestors, from White Europe, discovered this "New Found Land" in 1497 The indigenous people were the Beouthuks. By 1829 The Beothuks were extinct. We White Immigrants killed them all.
The solution to border anr the shut problems is simple. Your President has to go.
@CNNPolitics time to band together and get trump out of therebefoe it's too late. He's doing Putin's bidding.
@CNNPolitics Did you learn your dishonesty from trump or is this the real you?
@jaketapper About time you wokeupChristie.
RT @StopTrump2020: Who is to blame for the #Shutdown?		Let's get a lot of votes - please vote and then be kind and RT - thanks
@jon_keefe Yea, but is he a stellar human being??
Why can't your justice system get trump on tax evasion ? Can't be that hard.
@GovMikeHuckabee Hillary testified before congress for 11 hours. lets see your buddy trump do that.
Hey, Trump supporters...Did you pay your taxex last year?   ANSWER..Yes you did. Did your billionair President pay his taxes last year? ANSWER...nOOOOOOOOOO
Trump can relate to those who won't be getting a pay cheque..lol. of coures he does. all he has to do is break open another barrel of money.
Congrats s America. on your first Rusian President.
your republican party has gotten about as low as it can go ??
@RandPaul yea, what is it you don't understand? History will not be kind to you, sir.
@jaketapper he loves Russia. Let's hope he needs a place to run to.
My answer to Trump is very simple."The next time your country starts a war, don't ask Canada for Soldiers"
RT @krassenstein: It's been 54 Days since Fox News has tweeted, and 53 days since 'Fox News Politics' has posted on Facebook. 		The silence…
@BarryEhlert Precious
@krassenstein @chucktodd How about a pledge not to watch Fox news.
@alanthomasdoyle lol
@HuffPostPol Who pays good money to listen to this no talent loser ?
@krassenstein Couldn't have said it better myself.
RT @krassenstein: Trump claims that he has awarded 115 miles of new border wall construction. 		He didn’t. He’s lying. These 115 miles of r…
@VOCMOpenline Merry xmas to you all Paddy.
Poor Donald. Always the VictIm.
If trump would resign ,maybe he wouldn't be alone right now.
@PrincessBravato Actually he should be hung on the nearest light pole.
@grantstern If you could get a million people to march on the WH and throw those gangsters out. Now that would be something.
Trump has two Weasels whispering in his ear....Putin and Miller. Sad times ahead for the good old US of A,
I wonder how Putin is involved  with DTs latest decisions?
@CNNnewsroom @RepTomReed Well that makes sense. If there's nobody there then we can do a better job.
@AynRandPaulRyan Ah, poor baby
Lindsey Graham seems to be bucking DT. Might be too late Lindsey since you're  of the people  who has made him 'king|"
@ABCPolitics wake up Graham. He is KING now because of supporters like you.
@CBSNews walk away boys .Suck Holes
@AynRandPaulRyan @foxandfriends it's about you dick heads woke up.
@HuffPostPol The biggest murderers in history were White People.
@NancyGrace @DrPhil Yea, so is OJ Simpson and Casey Anthony .What a crock.
@HuffPostPol The Gov. is becoming evil,
@HuffPostPol Blaming sure runs in your family
@WhiteHouse Lies... DT WAS AND IS THE PROBLEM
@krassenstein if they were strong they wouldn't offer him a nickle for a wall that nobody want's-
@SpencerFernando Give the prick a one way ticket.
Too bad Al Capone is not around. He'd be perfect for DTs AG.
@GovMikeHuckabee Don't you have better things to do Mike
@krassenstein the french are smart enough to see this . americans are not.
@HuffPostPol Evil people under DT are converging on our Democracy.
If they pull a xmas song. why don't they pull Rap "music"?
P. Rand should talk to the "big guy"
Somebody , somewhere, do something before a bunch of news people get killed.. The blood  will be on your hands, Republicans.
@RepMattGaetz You can`t convict someone without evidence,
@CNNnewsroom @BobCorker not if he had the Casey  Anthony jury.
Patience, Rand Paul, You will know soon. If you have nothing to hide, then just relax.
@VOCMOpenline wHO CARES?????
@michaelcoren Maybe they need a better laeader?
@thehill lol  Man he's a crook like you.
manafort already knows he's getting a pardon.
When are americans goint to do something about a man who says he trusts his "Gut" over science? The World is laughing  loudly.
Your President is a friend of your enemies.  Isn't that enough reason for impeachment ??
@krassenstein Great idea
@CBSNews Isn't screaming the same in any language?
@thehill GEE, We all thought Mexico was going to pay for it.
I would love to see DTs tax returns for the last twenty years. Wouldn't you?
@CBSNews What a "DICK HEAD"
We shouldn't listen to Science folks. We should listen to DT and RS .Neither even knows what "CLIMATE CHANGE " means. Those who don't believe will only believe when it's too late.
@HuffPostPol We should try harder to explain to Rick and his buddy dt just what Climate change" is.
@HuffPostPol DTs problems are self inflected.
i would agree to a wall if DT and JJ would live on the other side.
@CBCNL Lets kill it all boys. That's what we're really good at.
@RWPUSA Wouldn't they look good in orange suits.
@davidhogg111 @KidsRights What's happened with gun control ??...NOTHING!! yOU GUYS GAVE UP.
Trump makes enemies of our friends an friends of our enemies.
We all know that Whitaker was hired to shut down Mueller. Fireworks ahead.
@thehill Not much point since we all know you don't have any guts.
You Trump supporters, why don't you ask Mr.Trump to produce his tax returns ? Try not paying your taxes and see what happens.
@JohnBick4 Amazing talent
@peterbakernyt @PressSec @Acosta Maybe she will write the questions????
@AmandaJaegerTV thats funny
@wesley_jordan Good to see someone with guts.
@RealJamesWoods the wright brothers are turning over in their graves.
The growing "hate' in America starts at the top ,folks.
i'm pissed. You know yesterdat the local corner store had apples on sale with a limit. This old woman went back to her car, changed he hat three times and got most of the apples. Shocking!!!!
OMG, There are real people at Fox.
so thr Reps. want the Dems to co-operate now. LOL!!
@HuffPostPol two peas in a pod
@thehill Well lets hope Mueller has enough to put him away. He's a REP.
@GovMikeHuckabee @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump you sound like a child
@GovMikeHuckabee @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Stop calling names, Man. Your hero is donald trump ???
I don't blame Tucker Carlson as much as I blame the people who listen to him.
@thehill This JERK should be fired!!
You all have to show your tax returns, if not you will go to prison. How come Donald Trump doesn't show his???The answer my friend is obvious.
Finally we've found someone who will stand up to trump. It's a foreign leader. Now if only our PM could get a little spine.
@girlsreallyrule A real President, a real human being.
Tax payers ,why don'y you ask your President to put a few dollars in the pot?
I give TRUMP credit for absolutely NOTHING.
Did all you hard working people pay your taxes last year ? Your President, a billionair, probably didn't pay a dime.
Terrible how your President treats black reporters. Jim Acosta should also get more support from CNN. I love CNN, They report what comes directly from the Presiden's filthy, lieing mouth.
In American politics today the American people are the blame. The number of Trump supporters out there boggles the mind. You get what you voted for.
@HuffPostPol Why are you there then?
Criss Cuomo is 100% right.  Let's leave it all to the old ghost in the sky. What a crock.
@HuffPostPol What a "DICK HEAD''
@politvidchannel Keep to the lies boys..It's all down hill for you two "DICK HEADS"
@PremierofNL @GrahamLetto @bernardjdavis @CarolAnneHaley How do you get so many "DICK HEADS" in one party?
I can't wait to see trump and Sarah Sanders  burst...There would be shit for hundreds of miles.
@HuffPostPol he should have shoved the mike up her ass. She was the one being aggressive.
@GovMikeHuckabee @trish_regan @WhiteHouse My dear, if your country follows the patc thier on you will not be allow to speac at all.	This president dosen's want any hard questions then you should.
Is Trump and Fox News going to cause a" Civil war"?
@GovMikeHuckabee @WhiteHouse he was trying to do his job too. I would have shoved the mike up her ass.
Who's going to tell that Idiot Trump to stop calling the press ''THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE".there's going to be more blood on his hands. Where's Mueller ?
@VOCMOpenline Eddy is making a fool of himself.
@Jim_Jordan LOL!!
@HuffPostPol Another "DICK HEAD"
@HuffPostPol You left out 'STUPID"
@accuweather Woman driver? hehe
@MSNBC Don't worry Don, Ryan has no guts. He's a lot like you.
@JRubinBlogger She's a lot likw her Father.
@VOCMOpenline How will trump accept defeat in the midterms My guess is he won't. Trouble	looming ?
@AC360 @TomSteyer Fox News should also be held accountable.
Don't forget to vote. the people are the only ones who can get this bunch of lyers and spinners out of the WH.
@renell_legrow @VOCMNEWS Why? The courts will just let him out the  back door.
@OrussellRussell You resign, that would fix the problem.
America should start it's own caravan. Put in it the Republican Party, their layers, their abbeters, and all the people at Fox News.
I wonder if Trumps wife or inlaws brought ant desease to America????		.
@RealJamesWoods Some of us horrified to what's happening to you.
@Reuters Looks like "god"was sleeping again!
Lets stop beating around the bush. Trump is responsible. Time to stand up to Him and Fox News.
I heard that Trump will pardon this bomb maker. lol
@GovMikeHuckabee Thank god the people say right through you.
@Dale81398373 You should not have helped him to get complete control of the Supreme court.
Trump will get a lot of people killed. I have no doubt.
@Jim_Jordan Your buddy Trump is responsible. People are going to die because of this piece of shit.
The people will decide Trump's fate. Be careful what you vote for.
@PeterAlexander She should blame her buddy,Trump
John Berman should teach Criss Cuomo how to conduct an interview!!
@VOCMOpenline If the Dems control the house and the senate after the midterms Trump will blame everyone but god. Could be serious trouble coming for Americans.
@SpeakerRyan "BULL SHIT"
@HarryTucker @Sgambin Do I look surprised ??
@Fred_Hutton @sjmorningshow @CBCNL @KrissyHolmes Another criminal who will be back on the street quickly.
@krassenstein Why doe's DT have so many supporters ? Are people that stupid ?
@davidfrum The criminal element is inside the border and it starts with you, Donald.
@leeleeb50 I can't
@VinniePolitan Casey Anthony
@SpeakerRyan Reality..You are in debth up to your ears. The little guy will pay.
@ThinkAtheist That shouldn't be news to anyone with a brain.
@krassenstein People who embrace this guy are as sick as him.
@krassenstein @marcthiessen He loves Dictators and he's a pathic liar. He's also a raciest. You guys loke DT because you people ar raciest yourself. Open your eyes, your going down the drain.
@HillReporter That's because your an idiot. An idiot is someone who defends DT.
@GovMikeHuckabee hang in there mike with the other despicables.
45% of Americans are just like Donald Trump. Let that sink in.
@VOCMOpenline I give Trump credit for, nothing.
@CillizzaCNN It's about time reporters started pushing back and stop accepting bs answers from this guy.
@krassenstein Yea, All his friends
@Jim_Jordan Be careful what you wish for.
@CBSNews that's a tall order buddy. lol
@AynRandPaulRyan you are an "air Head"

@stadiumtalkcom You ommitied Montreal.
@AmazonKDP  Hi I need to talk to someone, My no. is 7096341359

@thehill You're voting yes..DICK HEAD
@thehill Fake anger.
@USATODAY Yea, so those Canada.
@charliekirk11 she wanted an investigation while ur guy didn't. Pl;ain to see who's telling the truth.
@ThinkAtheist Tax these evil bastards.
@charliekirk11 Hillery Clinton testified for eleven straight hours and never flinched. They were both investigated and hillery came out clean. Not at all like the snivelling little liars like trump and Kavannaugh." Your Partisan Blind "man !
@RedStateDems The answer as we all know is because Trump wants it.
Trump is changing America. From where I sit I see devastation.
@RandPaul get rid of trump.
Kavanaugh is too much like DT for me. Always play the blame game.
John Berman is the best interviewer on tv today.
@DwightBallMHA Stop the blame game. Do something to help the people, LOWER THE HST..
Another entertaing day of American Politics.
Trump will soon crack.
@thehill No wonder your Country is in such a mess.
@RealMuckmaker That's because you're a bigger fool.
@girlsreallyrule man, that's dumb. I bet that if this was your daughter you wouldn't talk like that.
@DavidCornDC It was long, self-serving and boring.
@TheSarcasmShow That makes no sense ??
@NickMercer2 He was no good when he was a PC either
On the world stage, Trump is a clown.
Your Russian President is out of town today. He can still do a lot of damage though.
@SpeakerRyan you're a big part of the swamp. ryan.
@charliekirk11 trump will be ur worst nighmare, "DICKHEAD"
@charliekirk11 What planet you from ?
@charliekirk11 you believe him if he said shit is good to eat.
@RWPUSA What do you expect from a trump supporter?
@thehill I wish they'd hurry up.
@girlsreallyrule @CNN A  bunch of "air heads"
Why is Kavanaugh not speaking up and insisting on an fbi investigation.	? If it were me i would want no doubt left behind.
@ReardonNL They tried hard to buy this one. Good job Winsor Lake seeing through the lies.
@CNNPolitics Trump can face anyone except Putin .
Why is the Media not talking about Trump declassifing documents related to the 'Russisn Probe?"
@VinniePolitan I don't like the death penalty, but for this guy I have no problem with it at all.
@CillizzaCNN She getting into the game quickly. Watch your words Mrs. ,You might have to eat them.
@goingglocal @Ez4u2say_Janis THE DEMS SHOULD THREATEN THEM WITH TAXES.
@CNNnewsroom @emmersbrown @SenFeinstein If she didn't want anyone to know then why did she tell someone ?Strange.
@CillizzaCNN First time i've heard KAC say something sensible.
@CBSNews @FaceTheNation Yea, Don't want to lose your job.
@BillKristol Sry, don't watch fake news.
@jaketapper @Ocasio2018 She's not playing with real numbers.
@JimKilbane I'd probably help the C..t`.
RT @mmpadellan: 15 hours into trump's Twitter silence, apparently trumplethinskin is upset about footage showing him throwing rolls of pape…
@DobberHockey Hockey Players and beards just doesn't work for me.

@krassenstein Her actions were "over the top"	, in my opinion.
@TSN_Sports @JohnLuTSNMtl The team has hit rock bottom, might as well trade price. This franchise will turn around when the fans stay away and they get rid of bergevin.
@MAE_GovNL @PremierofNL You guys are trying to buy that by-election. Goog luck
@karentravers @PressSec @alex_mallin There soon will be none.
@TuckerCarlson Yes it is true, you dick head racists

@GovNL @MAE_GovNL wE'RE BEING HOODWINKED BY THESE LIBERALS!!

@RealMuckmaker Man, there's a lot of shit in that room.
@realDonaldTrump @CNN @NBCNews They have honest people, something you would know nothing about. They're coming for you Donald.

@thehill She's perfect for the republican Party.
@wesley_jordan I change channels when she appears.
@JudgeJeanine Sorry. don't like fiction.
Watch out...Trump has his back to the wall.
@NTVNewsNL @MikeConnors Lets see the details Mr .Ball .
@edhollett @charlespendercb I don't buy what the Premier is selling. Just normal election jargon.
@oneillyatescbc @PierreNeary I don't believe him. He'll say anything to get re-elected. He's already proven that he's a liar.
@JudgeJeanine Sorry. I don't like 'fiction'.
@thehill Who cares, He still thinks O.J.Simpson is innocent.
Blame Obama, Why didn't i think of that.? What a farse.
@MSNBC @chrislhayes lol,There's a lot of RATS inside the WH.
@NewDay Nothing will change. Just lip service as usual. These evil Bastards should be put out of business. STOP SUPPORTING THEM.
@CNN If She's afraid to call out her Husband then it's just "window dressing''.
@MSNBC Trump has turned you into a babbling idiot.
@VinniePolitan A very sad story. No justice.
The Catholic Church created a haven for pedophiles. Stop supporting these people and they will shut down. They should also be taxed. Time to smarten up people.
@CBSNews What a bluff!!
@CBSNews Me thinks he protests too much.
@thehill tOO BAD THEY CAN'T HAVE pUTIN JOIN THEM.

@IndivisibleNet @Ez4u2say_Janis Evil!!
@thehill "AIR HEADS " at Fox News, What else is new .
In America, Mr Coumo, You can get in a lot of trouble telling the Truth. I agree with you, America was never that great.
Donald Trump.......A Wart on the Ass of Humanity !!
@thehill Ok everyone, lets line up to kiss his ass.
@CBSNews SHE IS A LIAR !!
Trump could be "taken down" by a Black Woman. Love it.
@NPR Stop giving them money and stop going to Church. You'll shut them down very quickly. Smarten up.
@CNNPolitics Another liar..Oh me nerves.
The Catholic Church is in the news again. This bunch should have been shut down long ago. An organization that preaches morality but has none themselves. Easy to shut them down, just stop going to Church.
@CNNPolitics Why ? Smarten up people. The investigation is over when all the evidence is in.
@CBSNews Every time you give these evil people money you are complaisant in their crimes.
@RandPaul What the hell is really going on here ??
@amconmag @RandPaul What backbone , He's delivering secret messages to our biggest enemy for trump.
@TheRickWilson She's just too black, hey Donald .
@realDonaldTrump sHE HAD TO DEAL WITH A LOW LIFE LIKE YOU!!

@MaxKingsleyEh How come Trump is still there ?
@ABCPolitics You would know !!
@thehill You got a better place to go Laura ?
@KFaulders @ABCPolitics @PressSec @OMAROSA Every third sentence that come out of trumps mouth is a lie Get what you sew.
@kaitlancollins @jaketapper Fight fire with fire!!
@NewDay @VanJones68 What a piece of work.
@thehill Immigrants make our Country great. It's People like you and Trump who bring us down.
@CNNPolitics They should do something about the Space in their heads.
@VinniePolitan So shocking, and nobody payed for this crime.
@realDonaldTrump Har to cut your taxes since you don't pay any.
@CNNPolitics I likes She b.y. She shut Chris up and gave a great answer to his question. Good job Chris, letting someone talk sense.
@ABCPolitics Those Two are up to NO GOOD.
The swamp is slowly being drained. The biggest pieces of garbage will to taken out soon.
@thehill I wonder if Canada has as many stupid people .
@CNNPolitics LOL.... Good luck with that one.
@thehill Here's two people who have spent a lifetime immersed in lies. I agree with the Pope on this one.
@realDonaldTrump Too bad you can't do the same to Russia.
@NewDay @Scaramucci Does he think we're all stupid . Nobody is buying his spin. Good job John, you didn't let him hog all the time like Cuomo does.
@MacMcKinseyIV @sanford17 Don't forget to bring your kid to these events. Amazing !!
@CNNPolitics I can Imagine!!!
@themamibunni @jenwaye71 you left out Fox News
@samarchitects @mhanrahan709 These are 'god's creations....LOL !!
@TSN_Sports pRAYS TOO MUCH.

@realDonaldTrump Guess i'm a fool.
@jaketapper There must be a way you people can get rid of trump.
@thehill No hannity, You own that title. Noone is even in your league.,
@CNNPolitics LOL!!
@CillizzaCNN Not fit to be President
@realDonaldTrump Pastors will kiss any ass.
@morningmika She'a afraid of Trump. She's also  a coward.
@sanford17 @DarrellPowerNL @TedGrills At least you could put something on for someone else. hehe
@CNNPolitics Say	 it to your father's face.
@ziyatong @sanford17 You never know. Trump supporters are dumb..
@rockdaboatNL @PamNParsons I guess we should forget about tha HST then.
Trump's "Last Stand" gets closer.
@CNNPolitics When did he wake up. No doubt it's gonna be Obama's fault.
@realDonaldTrump You could be watching the news from  Prison by then.
@CillizzaCNN I agree man. Now go have a shave.
@NewDay They always have someone to blame. A real leader would take responsibility.
@CillizzaCNN He ommitted "WHITE"
@thehill Why??
@SpeakerRyan You Guys are taking too much credit for what Obama started.
@Sportsnet @SNJeffBlair This guy should spend less time praying and more time being a man.
@CillizzaCNN "SURPRISE" !!
@DevlinBarrett Sounds like DT is preparing his "Last Stand"
@CillizzaCNN I think we all know what DT's "Last Stand" will look like.
@GoofyNewfie2012 Your body is sending you a message. Listen to it.
@QuancyClayborne @Ez4u2say_Janis LOL!!
@thehill Trump is in training.
@SohiAmarjeet @PremierofNL @Equinor And the people will get poorer. We always end up with nothing .
@SpeakerRyan Yea Obama did a good job.
@USATODAY @usatodayopinion That probably makes perfect sense to trumps base.
@thehill Poor boy..don't cry.
@GoofyNewfie2012 This is silly and stupid.
@thehill what a dick head.
@RWPUSA @NBCNews He's afraid of questions, Obviously
@CNN LOL!!!
@PremierofNL @NR_GovNL @GovNL @SiobhanCoadyNL @Equinor_NA @HuskyEnergy Get the HST down .Give us a friggin break.
@PremierofNL @GovNL @Equinor_NA @NR_GovNL @SiobhanCoadyNL @SohiAmarjeet @HuskyEnergy When do you think the HST will go down ?
@NTVNewsNL what bs
@SpeakerRyan Then help take down your President. Get some backbone man.
What will Trump do just before his "Last Stand"?
@CillizzaCNN What a lying child.
@GoofyNewfie2012 The keystone Cops at it again ???
@kenolin1 Stand up America, we're all going down the drain with you underTrump.
@politico No one can spin like Sarah.
Where is the Country's breaking point with Trump ??Must be close. It had better be close.
@jaketapper @KurtSchlichter @barbarastarrcnn I don't understand how the reporters let Sarah Sanders off with all that BS. Time for the press to call her out.
@NicolleDWallace @SteveSchmidtSES His Base numbers should go up again. lol
@SpeakerRyan Get some spine, Ryan
@AmandaNL82 Looks awesome!!!
@CNNnewsroom Another person talking sense. Don't see much of that in American Politics
@thehill Sure u r.
@thehill How can it be fake news when the press reports and shows every word that comes out of his mouth?
@NewDay @MichaelRCaputo Once a trump man always a trump man. How can you deny what you see and hear right in front of you.Amazing
@CBSNews Dick Head
@FayeGrim could be a sting ??
@CillizzaCNN I can't wait to see what he's gonna dp next.
@CBSNews Good for whoopi.
@ClickHole Rember that cartoon dog who was 50% irish setter,50% labrador, 50% pointer and 50% german sheppard...lol
@RyeCat773 @ClickHole @TheOnion tRUMP COULD HAVE WROTE THAT LOL
@USATODAY LOL!!
@thehill What's wrong with you people? If someone doesn't confront Trump your Country is going down the drain.
@thehill You tell her whoopi. We need more people like you who are not afraid to speak up.
@realDonaldTrump We don't idolize Putin . I can't wait for you to get what's coming to you.
@JohnBerman @RickSantorum Why do you even talk to rick Santorum. Remember his solution to School shootings was for the kids to learn "first aid". He's not revelent.
@CNNPolitics Trump looks like he's just been taken to task.
@CNNPolitics I wonder if he checked with Putin first.
@SpeakerRyan @ICEgov Why don't you give your Country honest government. Now that would be something different.
@CBSNews @PressSec I hope she likes living in Russia.
@TSN_Sports @DeMar_DeRozan @TFlight31 @DeMarreCarroll1 HE'S WELL PAID FOR WHAT HE DOES.
WHERE ARE THE CHILDREN THAT TRUMP CAGED. HAVE WE FORGOTTEN ABOUT THEM. ?
@VOCMOpenline @DownNorth People are not stupid, they're just GOD DAM CONTARY.
@CillizzaCNN Oh Trump absolutely believes you were hacked. He's just not allowed to say it.
@thehill dick head
@CillizzaCNN How long are you people gonna put up with this clown, a very dangerous clown.?
@CNNPolitics Do something Sir. Your Country needs you.
@VOCMOpenline There are a lot of stupid people around, Paddy.
@CNNPolitics Time to give it up Man. You threw your people under the bus . WHY ????/
@thehill LOL!!!!!.
@thehill He was suppose to represent America, not Russia.
@CNN He can make all the remarks he wants. The whole world say and heard him.
@hullboydan @sanford17 LOL!!
@CBSThisMorning @CBSNews @RandPaul Another "dick head"
@toddp442 @MoveOn @realDonaldTrump @robreiner CNN got rid of their "dick heads". Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson still have their Jobs.
@NewDay @Scaramucci He needs to go..Trump that is
@CNNPolitics Your a traitor Man. Spin spiin spin
Can you imagine if Obama had done what Trump did Yesterday. I think the Reps. would be waiting at the airport with a rope. Shocking!!
@CNNPolitics Pence is more evil than Trump.
After that meeting Trump looked worried . Putin has him by the nuts.
@PremierofNL I'll celebrate when you do something about the HST.
@CBCNL Because it won't get Politicians elected.
@MoveOn @realDonaldTrump @robreiner Hey Rob: I'm a Canadian. We are just as concerned as you are. It's frightening to see what is going on with this President . What's also scary is how many people can't see through this guy. You also have to start coming down hard on Fox News. They carry his message loudly.
@Rossmac212 @stirthepot7 I think i could have handled that task in grade 5....lmao
@DavidCornDC LOL
@jaketapper Very Sad
@JRogan3000 @CochraneCBC @GaryLineker @ProfTimBale @EaAlex27 What a pig.
When your Country is under attack and the President is  complicit with the enemy, isn't that TREASON ? Just asking.
@CBSNews Doesn't anyone in the Republican Party understand that your Country is being invaded by the Russians.
@CNNnewsroom @GaryTuchmanCNN America, Why don't you want those people. They will make your Country GREAT.
The Children are still waiting to be rescued.
How can Trump confront the man who got him elected ??? Stay tuned , more lies coming.
@CNNnewsroom @smerconish If Trump has a confrontation with Putin, I'll eat my dirty shorts. I have no worries.
@VOCMOpenline Yea, Hard to believe for sure.
@JimKilbane Religion!!
WHERE ARE THE CHILDREN ? Trump is distracting the Media. Please don't let this inhumane practice die.
@joeoz8703 @CillizzaCNN I doubt he won fair and square. Has Trump ever done anything Fair and square ?
Trump is sure taking the focus of those lost kids. Come on Media, get back on track. The children need you.
@CNNnewsroom He's so full of shit he could burst at any minute.
@CNN The truth, how refreshing.
@FoxNews big deal, All your going to get are lies. Tired of Politicians and no more Fox News for me.
The Republicans won't let Trump sit down with Mueller but have no concerns sitting down with Putin.
@GoofyNewfie2012 Send them to Kent please and then WalMart
@nytimes If you people don't get rid of Trump things will get a lot worse.
@CNN Donald Trump approves of this message.
@FoxNews wHO WILL tRUMP BLAME WHEN IT TURNS AROUND ? The economy was improving under Obama. Trump get's no credit from me.
@FoxNews Should be President instead of the DICK HEAD you have.
@SteveDickerNL Awesome!!
@sanford17 That's not funny, Rod.
@NancyGrace How many times did she stab him, maybe like 28. That might have had something to do with it.
@FoxNews When will Trump pay his share ???????
@CTVNews That's fine, but we all know that under Canadian Law he will walk.
@FoxNews @SebGorka @POTUS If you 'DICK HEADS" think that North Korea is going to denuclearize than you are delusional.
@CNN How stupid is this ?
@CNN Real class.
@NewDay @RickSantorum This guy is a real dick head.
@RealMuckmaker Geeze, I thought he fixed all that. lol
@FoxNews @dbongino Where your going right now is a diaster.
@FoxNews @GovMikeHuckabee @PressSec @NextRevFNC And what about a President who calls the Media "The Enemy of the People"???
All those protests , love it, Now if every speach started and ended with "Donald Trump is not fit to be President" Now that would carry a lot of punch. Come on folks ,go right to the problem .
@CNN Then why isn't Graham standing up to Trump and help keep America a Demoracy.
@VOCMOpenline Good old Canadian Law.
@washingtonpost no problem for her.
Trump and Putin will probably decide how tp split up the US between them.
America going down the drain. There must be something that can  be done about this President.
How come he didn't put a travel ban on Canada? We're a security threat. Doesn't matter, you'll never see my ass in the US again anyway. BUY CANADIAN FOLKS..
@PremierofNL @NavdeepSBains @CNA_News @GovNL @YvonneJJones @TCII_GovNL @AESL_GovNL @ahawkins790 @MitchelmoreMHA Must be an election coming....
I just can't grasp the fact that more than 40% of Americians are like Donald Trump.
@FoxNews @FLOTUS Tell your Husband.
@IngrahamAngle First Laura, You have to be a decent Human Being.
If all Mexicians are murderes and rapists, are all Americians like Trump??
Sarah Sanders should realize that it's Her Boss who is spreading hate and division in the Country.
@CNNnewsroom @PressSec Your boss is the one spreading hate and division in your Country.  You should consider gettin away from this toxic Tryant
@PremierofNL @OLA_GovNL @TW_GovNL @HCS_GovNL @YvonneJJones @LisaVDempster @GrahamLetto @PerryTrimper Reduce the HST first . We need a break. Stop spending money.
@SpeakerRyan Mr. Ryan,The biggest problem in your Country right now is the POTUS. If he stopped calling names long enough and welcomed the Dems. to join him in finding solutions,the job would get done. Gutless people like you are also part of the problem. Stand and be counted.
@IngrahamAngle Laura,History will not be kind to you and history for you is not far away.
@NewDay @RepRaskin @Jim_Jordan Wow,Jim Jorden talking sense.
@1972sammyt @sanford17 Good point...Sad!!!!
@maggieNYT @jaketapper He left out making him King.
Trump can sign all the documents he wants but the reality remains the same. The world is watching.
Is the President now thinking that the Media will be satisified and ease off. Remember what Ronald Regan said. "We beleive you, but you must verify"I think that's close. We should watch closer now. Actually i think the worse is yet to come. Donald will hit back.
Well your President and his crew of misfits had a great "Kiss Ass' session today. These milionaires/billionairs will never connect with the poor, after all they were born with a silver spoon n the mouths!!
Your President said that Canadians go across the border and buy shoes and scuff them up to make them look old. LMFAO..Where did you get this guy ????
@GoofyNewfie2012 iT'S JUST cANADIAN lAW FOLKS.
@PremierofNL @GovNL @PLIAN_NL @NLSACPC Why don't you do something about the HST ?
@RWPUSA You are in charge. therefor you are the problem.
Shameful what's going on in America today. No one will face down this Putin Wannabe.
@DavidKusnet She belongs with Trump.
Why is the World not outraged by what's going on at the mexico/American border?
What America is becoming under Trump is shocking. The fact that he has so many supporters is even more shocking.
Please America, find a way to rid your Country of  this Dictator and his buddies. Those poor people don't deserve this. Donald Trump is a Tyrant. Time to step and be counted.
@CillizzaCNN what else is new??
@CillizzaCNN You can't be serious.??
I'd like to remind Mr. Session that Saint Paul was not a real person.
@CNN wHAT A DIDKHEAD
America now detains children in cages. HOW LOW CAN YOU GO FOLKS ????
@ItsMeCathi @sanford17 i won't pray, because talking to an invisable man who lives in the sky is not my idea of sanity. However i sure hope it's true.
@CNNnewsroom @VanJones68 You have to do something about this President.
@ChelseaClinton @Twitter I think you're beautiful. Remember ,Chelsea, most people are full of SHIT.
@wallylayman @meganshawCTV @grahamctv We will have to do our homework.
@CBCNL Won't be welcomed by me. What interest would he have in NL, after we're a Democary.
@NTVNewsNL You're sick in the head man. He's a "Dictator Lover', not someone we want around here. Smarten up.
@PremierofNL @realDonaldTrump Don't bring that PIG here.
@CillizzaCNN dONALD HASN'T HAD HIS LOLLYPOT TODAY??
All Kim has to do is stroke Trump's ego..nothing more.
@HLNTV Show me a woman with muscles and i'll show a ugly woman.
@joonlee @jaketapper What a man ....
@CBCNL @ENNISmusic @CBCWam Beautiful!!!
North Korea will never denuclearize. Trump has just found himself a new ,Dictator, friend while treating US friends with distain. To all who read this..If it says "Made in USA" ,Don't buy it.
@SeamusORegan @PremierofNL Do something useful Seamus and help get the HST down. It's killing us.
@RichardHaass @jaketapper Right on Robert.
I now have a new policy when i go shopping. If it says "Made in America" I put it back.
@NewDay Another spinner. I'll never forget George Carlin's Take on Politicians. George would have loved this guy.
@PremierofNL @valeglobal @NR_GovNL @GovNL @TCII_GovNL @MiningNL @MarkDBrowne @GrahamLetto Why don't you do something about the HST ? dO SOMETHING FOR THE PEOPLE FOR A CHANGE, INSTEAD OF YOURSELF.
@realCarrickRyan @sanford17 Love it. lol
Trump is mad at Trudeau because he wouldn't kiss his ass. Justin should have given him a lollypop before he left.
Trump,is about ready to crack!!
There's only one person in the whole world who can't get along with Canade..Donald J. A. Trump. The A is for  asshole.
@sanford17 Humber valey resort
@RealDonaldTrFan WTF!!!
@CBCNL We await the slap on the wrist.
@DonBradshawNTV @PremierofNL @DwightBallMHA @NTVNewsNL Another bluff. Get the HST down.
@DonBradshawNTV @PremierofNL @DwightBallMHA the pcs won two elections on this fake news, now the Libs. will try to do the same.. Let's stop allowing these guys use the cbh as election bate.
@CillizzaCNN These press people should get together and plan their approach. Everyone ask the same question until she gives an acceptable answer.
You need to take better control of your interviews. Two people talking at the same time causes me to switch channels, Afte all i can get the highlights the very next morning.
@CNN You gotta get Trump out first, The Reps. are deeply in the pockets of the NRA. Then	 you need to really presure the Dems. to do what's right.
@DarrellPowerNL lol
So Donald tells us he is now "above the Law" Does this mean that he also thinks he's now a "Dictator". Just asking folks.
@WinstonTapper @jaketapper Thats a happy pup
@BlueJays @JohnAxford These losers need a ride.
@CNNnewsroom @FareedZakaria What a waste of time talking to that racists sob.
@BlueJays Look at the bright side. if they don't play, they won't  lose.
@CillizzaCNN Because the law is changing under Trump. If you don't get this guy out there will disaster to come.
@BlueJays Do you guys have an opening? My grandmother is looking for a game.
@realDonaldTrump If you would sit down with Mueller it would end. You sound lie a very scared puppy.
@davidhogg111 @BarackObama Please don't stay too long.
@CillizzaCNN those people are fools
@CillizzaCNN Wake up Harry.
@CillizzaCNN Not gonna happen.
@realDonaldTrump Fucking Idiot!!
@kearyhanan @CillizzaCNN Blame, blame and blame...The Trump way
@CillizzaCNN Why is he still President.?	 That alone should be enough for impeachment.
@CNN About time
@CNNnewsroom @BrookeBCNN @iamsambee Your President is fueling this .
@NewDay Another supported of '"'Trump Values"
@kylegriffin1 @jaketapper Just showing their true colors.
@HLNTV There are just too many stupid people in the world.
Rosanne, stop maling excuses..You're just a terrible Human Being.
@CNN Another Genius.
Racism is alive and well in the US. With the President fueling the fire we're just seeing people's real feelings coming through.
@wealthy_barber @Fred_Hutton Their all NHL Players,,you twit.
@CillizzaCNN He's going to crack.
@wpjenna @jaketapper OMG!!....What has become of America??
@CNN ''Bye'
@DeanObeidallah Time for people at Fox to to get some backbone and stop reporting lies and spins. About time someone stood up for the truth. Don't let your "Christian Values" become "Trump Values."
@Pontifex @Gerry_Byrne "YAWN"
@robreiner Rob, there must be something you peole can do about this situation. People like you, who have some clout, should be talking more about the liars at Fox News.
@NewDay America has stooped to a new low. No compassion under this Administration. No Christian Values left. Trump is destroying Demoracy bit by bit and is aided a abetted by those around him.
@CNN His libs are moving.
@CNN Good man....A Politician with guts. Now that's something new.
@robreiner Giuliani is down in the gutter with him.
@CNN How does he know that???
@CNN Who cares?????
@DonBradshawNTV They should be doing something that can help people, like getting the 	GST lowered.
@mattdunntsn @RickMoranis53 @TheDaveThomas You are not welcome in this Country "Mr. Bone Spurs". I think i speak for a lot of Canadians.
@TheBeatWithAri @CONDESCENDANT @RepSwalwell Lets not gorget the role that Sean Hannity is playing .
@RWPUSA Now your freedom will soon be gone.
@CNN Prison is free.
@CillizzaCNN Get out you lazy good for nothing.
@jaketapper If Trump gets his way Americans won't be allowed to speak against him.
@CTVNews Because of you,President Bone Spurs, we are looking for many markets in Europe and Asia. Take you BULL SHIT, somewhere else.
@NTVNewsNL No Justice ,again. So what else is new.
@BlueJays @BuffaloBisons @DeVoTrAv @MiLB WHY?
@CillizzaCNN It Bothers me and i'm a Canadian.
@glenn_payette @CBCNL We should bring back public hanging for this piece of shit. If only we had a justice system.
@CNN @StCollinson Donald Trump tells us every day that he lives in fear of this investigation. He last ditch efford will be to fire everyone in the doj who's involved . Coming to a theather near you soon.
@CillizzaCNN This guy is a very big part of the problem.
@CNN Why is anything a religious leader says relavant ? Time for people to get over this nonsense and come live in the real world.
@Jayf17z WHO CARES ?
@Bourdain @byr_ne @globeandmail @GlobeArts Right on Anthony. We in Canada have known that for years. Great show in Newfoundland..Thank you.
@davidfrum @JoyAnnReid @TheAtlantic Yep it's the guns
One of the worst teams in Baseball. Who's running things anyway? Come on you bunch of losers, make me eat my words. I don't have much to worry about.
@WalshFreedom And you have no leadership. A President who is a big part of the problem.
@CNNnewsroom Stop the praying because it's a waste of good energy. To fix the gun problem ,start by demanding the regsignation of Mr. Bone spurs and all who are in bed with the NRA.
Let's put the blame for gun violence where it belongs. The POTUS !!
On "State of the Union"this am.The Panel talked about Mental Health. Every County has the same  Mental Health problems as the US. However no other Country has your gun problem. Donald Trump wants a parade.The people should have a parade right to his door step. A million to start.
@CanBlogHouse @CONDESCENDANT @obrienstours @FordCanada @NLtweets @DestinationSJ @JustinLaurenXO Fine looking bunch.
@NancyGrace I would but i'v never seen prayer do any good. Only your President has the power to mave a difference and we know he's bought and payed for.
@jaketapper Our scumbag Politicians cannot be held accountable. As to this girls statement..It's not something that's ever heard in a civilized Country.
@CNNnewsroom @juliettekayyem Will never happen. The President's solution will be more guns. NO GUNS, NO SHOOTINGS, just my silly logic.
Shocking..The republicians with POTUS and the NRA are responsible for this latest diaster. "No action Trump" and his team of liars are your worst nightmare right now. The world is watching this disaster you call a Democracy.
@CNN Too much praying and not enough action. The President and the NRA are responsible.
@CNN What else is new ?
@CNN When?????
@CillizzaCNN Get out of the swamp. Giuliani.
@CNN do something about guns, you idiot.
@RealMuckmaker @sanford17 Sean...Your a dispictable Human Being.
@MegynTODAY @megynkelly We never know what's or not true when Fox is reporting.
@MegynTODAY @megynkelly @TODAYshow You guys look like your lost in time. lol
@BlueJays By the end of June I predict thatToronto will be 20 games outta first.
@jaketapper Thanks for telling that Trump is guilty of something.
@NewDay Giuliani is now part of the sewer.
@AC360 @GaryTuchmanCNN Those Christians are evil
@GoofyNewfie2012 @dwancherry I agree. Awful
@NewDay @ananavarro hEY rICK, mAYBE WE SHOULD  ALL TAKE ,FIRST AID.
@FoxNews @CillizzaCNN @AndrewCMcCarthy Time to wake you "dick heads" at Fox..Trump is bringing your Country DOWN.
@NTVNewsNL @daniellebarron Amazing..Still spending while our GST IS 15% . WISH I COULD GET THE HELL OUTTA THIS PLACE!
@CNN DAMMMMM...i WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING HIS FAT ASS GOING OF TO PRISON.
@vicecanada Don't blame all Newfounderlanders. We have a few who complain about anything and everything. The show was great.
@SpiffNL @violet_raven @Bourdain We have afew complainers.Always the ones. I think their a  club .
@Bourdain I loved the show. Ignore the naysayers.
@CillizzaCNN Yea, we shouldn't do what he has done.
@DownNorth We're all sorry that we're not as smart as you.
@CillizzaCNN dICK hEAD
@CBCFrancesca @Fred_Hutton @CityofStJohns @KrissyHolmes @DestinationSJ Don't get excited St.John's. They just left here, The only money they spend is at the Dollarama. What does a cruise cost now ? Maybe close to $10000. They quibble over a dollar.
@CNN Too many stupid people in the world.
@sanford17 @GoofyNewfie2012 @byr_ne We should tell Americans that we have very small group of very active	 assholes.
@CillizzaCNN I hope when it's over he does his complaining from a jail cell.
@zachgoudie @joebeef Ignore the complaints. Iv been here for 74 years and it was a great show, thank you.
'Parts Unknown" Great show, loved it, could have shown a lot more..Whales,Icebergs, Puffins, I don't know why they went to Buchans to find a Moose. There's more on the outskirts os St.John's. Anyway, it was a great show. I was very pleased. Thank you CNN.
@Devin_Heroux It doesn't bother me. We probably started it.
@AC360 @CONDESCENDANT @andersoncooper @Bourdain @PartsUnknownCNN @CNN He still can't say Newfoundland correctly. It's New fen land..just say it fast. Also you won't find moose meat in grocery stores. It's illigal to sell Moose meat...All good though.
@davidhogg111 Your President is bought and paid for...Nothing good will happen,
@Indira_L @SenJohnMcCain @PolitiFact Bone Spur`s Channel
@CillizzaCNN What do you expect from ``The Trump Channel``
@VOCMOpenline Chilsish
@CNN I"m sre he does. The good stuff is starting to come out.
@robreiner Rob..Do you see a little Archie Bunker in Trump?
US Tarriffs of 22%  on Canadian newsprint has Canada finding new markets in Europe. I hope we take as much business as possible out of the US.
@CillizzaCNN POWER...Give someone a little power and they become arrogant.
@JackSmithIV We are appalled when we see Muslims doing this.
@CNN He will never accept that a Black Man was President. History will be much kinder to Obama than Trump.
@VOCMOpenline I wish Ball would stop spending money.
@CillizzaCNN I thought it was "process"
@CNN Has Trump brought Sarah down to his level or is this the real Sarah Sanders ?
@CNN Why bother Jake.
@CNN Blunt is a part of the SWAMP.
@jaketapper @RoyBlunt @realDonaldTrump Not to me , never.
@worldhockeyrpt @sanford17 I don't watch hockey much any more. After this i won't watch any.
@CNN Jake,  You should ask her if you could get a word in from timt to time. She talks keeps talking just to run out her time.
@jaketapper Twins ?  lol
@RWPUSA @HuffPost If Fox turns on him, he's finished.
@CNN If he meets with Mueller i'll eat my dirty shorts.
@CNN Sad.
@CNN Maybe there's nobody left to kill.
@jaketapper @JimmyKimmelLive Certainly one of my favorits,
@CillizzaCNN when are you guys gonna figure out a way to get rid of this IDIOT.
@McCabeMeg @Fred_Hutton Ball is doing the right thing.
@VOCMOpenline Doesn't take long for arrogance to set in once	 you get a bit of power.
@NancyGrace Not surprised at all.
@sanford17 Puddy Tat.
@CNN Don Rickles is turning over in his grave.
@CNN No talent...
@NewDay wHAT A dICK HEAD.
@CNN I'm not a fan of Sarah Sanders. She has become morally banckrupt  defending DT. She does not deserve this treatment from this no-talent person.
@CNN Our fate in Donald's Trumps hands. OMG
@BlueJays Let the bells ring .
@CillizzaCNN Don't know how she's going to make a living....She's just not funny.
@BlueJays @Sportsnet @MLBTV @FAN590 @Sportsnet650 @Sportsnet960 If the BJs	 Can't compete with the Yanks or the RSox, then their season is already over.
@CillizzaCNN yOU SHOULD RESIGN.
@CNN Why don't you ask him who he's going to jump into bed with next.
@HLNTV Dick Head
@CNN Swallow all the BS People. You've become a part of the SWAMP.
@CBCNL Eddie is a great guy...If you don't believe me then just ask him.
@CillizzaCNN Sounds like He's involved.
@PeterCBC The sitting Clounds
@EddieSheerr Ther're looking for a twig sandwitch.
@Fred_Hutton You're doing the right thing. Don't give up.
@Fred_Hutton Good idea, you certainly the credibility.
@CNN I hope you guys will not be a voice for Donald Trump. I'm a Canadian but all I  can say is " God help America.
@Fred_Hutton @PremierofNL @CBCNL @sjmorningshow The "Chicken Man " strikes again.
@AC360 What a dick head
@Big6domino I truley feel for the Guy but i can'f figure out what "Skittles" had to do with anything???
@CNN The bigger the mouth, the bigger the liar.
@CillizzaCNN And the swamp thickens.
@CNNMoney The swamp people.
@smerconish @realDonaldTrump No
@robreiner Rob: I think you have Trump pegged just right.
@GoofyNewfie2012 Hey Goofy, do you work?
Looks like i'm going to lose my pension. "The Trump Gang" put a 22% tariff on Canadian Newsprint. Thank you Mr. President.
@CillizzaCNN Ok boys, we'll ask you again in fifteen minutes.
@CNN @brianstelter Dangerous people. I hope they go down with Trump.
@GoofyNewfie2012 If you catch them, cut of their arms. That would make it harder for those bastards.
@CillizzaCNN What's the odds of having the "worse FBI Director" and the worse President at the same time.
@CNNMoney Garbage mouth.
@davidfolkenflik @CochraneCBC Excuse me , i have to go throw up.
@AC360 @GaryTuchmanCNN What do you expect from"Christians", Remember these are people who believe there's an old man sitting up in the sky watching everything we do . I;m happy to say that I have more morality than these people.
@CillizzaCNN The swamp thickens
@kyledcheney You couldn't pay me enough to watch that Crap. A	ll i want to know is who his sponsors are.
@davidaxelrod This bullying. This guy is going to get us all killed.
@CNN Put the spin on Allan, he's signing your checks  now.
@CNNSotu @CNNnewsroom @jaketapper @JenGranholm @RickSantorum @ninaturner @BillKristol I won't watch or listen to a guy who thinks the answer to your ,gun problem' is that school kids should learn cpr. Not worth the bs that comes from this guy.
@CNN @CillizzaCNN Another Rep. with a bad memory. The swamp gets bigger.
@MakeItPlain @JoyAnnReid He was never going to talk to Mueller.
@kathrynw5 @jaketapper I wouldn't watch this "DICK HEAD"
@VOCMNEWS Ducks probably can't read...
@CNN another trump yes man.
@esquire @CONDESCENDANT @CharlesPPierce Can you say "DOWN THE DRAIN"

@dannydumaresque Put the money in the CB Hospital
@CBCNL A link that will be used by an handful of people. Lets put the money into the CB Hospital that will be used by thousands.
@michael_ahrens @jaketapper YOU PEOPLE WILL HAVE A DIFFERENT TUNE WHEN YOU'RE LIVING UNDER A DICTATORSHIP
@CillizzaCNN Maybe this is his way of warning his buddy Putin telling what's coming.
@stealthygeek @CONDESCENDANT Your Country is getting close to a dictatorship and you people at Fox ignore what's going on. What's wrong with you ?????
@jaketapper @PressSec Or maybe he's trying to get up enough courage to fire the Special Council??
@WalshFreedom It's everybody's fault...
@JVM Why don't you look at your own slaughter houses? Jane.
@NTVNewsNL Canadian Justice.?
@JoyAnnReid @NYDailyNews Why aren't more people trying  to get this "CLOWN" from Office ?
@TeamGushue We're all proud of you. I played baseball, soccer,and tennis . You can't always be at you best. Sometimes it's just the other guys time.
@BradGushue Great job. We're all proud.

@JohnKingCNN @elianayjohnson @mollyesque @mkraju @jdawsey1 He won't
@GoofyNewfie2012 I won't hold my breath  on that one.
@CNN Christians defending DT makes them just like him. Liars, cheaters, Adulterers , Bullies.	Just calling people names should be enough for Christians to distance themselves. Must be money in the pot somewhere. You "Christians are sickening"
@thedailybeast @JoyAnnReid wHAT MIND????
@jimmykimmel God is watching you Sean. I don't thing he's liking what he's 	seeing. You "DICK HEAD"
@LeanneNaramore You 	Dick Heads
@jaketapper That's sad.
@GoofyNewfie2012 Do what you  want. I don't have to like it. It's degrading.
@GoofyNewfie2012 Change your name...It's degrading
@MMFlint The Church is a poor place to look for morality.
@CBCNL Make no mistake, our "Justice system" will fail us again.
@BradGushue @Fred_Hutton You guys need to play better. When you get a good lead then kill every rock you can. Come on guys, i'm absolutely confused at what you are doing. Start playing like the best team in the world.
@CurlingCanada @Fred_Hutton @BradGushue You guys are doing great. Please play the scoreboard more.
@FDRLST @mkhammer I don't like fiction.
@HealingMB @FayeGrim That's the way we should treat all animals.
@BlueJays @HondaCanada Another long season for Blue Jay fans ?
@NancyGrace @crimeonlinenews She never did report her daughter missing. It was her Mother who made that call. I think this was overlooked in the trial.
@CNN I have never watch her show and have no interest in it now. "NO TALENT"
@NewDay The kids got more sense than anyone at Fox News.
@CNN Thank God i live in Canada.
@CNN It shows the way you think...You "Dick Head"
@NewDay What a dind-a-ling. Give it to him good Chris.
@cuomo_chris  Great Job on Santurom , He has no interest in gun control. Cpr is what will fix your gun problem Chris, you know that ,lol

@CNN Everyone's a liar except Donald...Hummm
@sanford17 @Fred_Hutton More to come Rod.
@CNN What the hell is going on in your Country ? 42% for trump. Amazing, Amazing.
@jaketapper There must be a way you people can get this bum out.
@BlueJays @russellmartin55 @Sportsnet @FAN590 Geeze, i hope their not out of the playoff picture by the end of June.

@CNN DICK HEAD
@CNN Trump is the one who caused the problem.
@RWPUSA @CNNPolitics What a "Dick Head"
@CNNSotu @jaketapper @brikeilarcnn @timkaine @JohnKasich @VanJones68 @chavezlinda @RickSantorum @RepBarragan @KateBennett_DC Santorum is part of the problem. More guns means more shootings....Just simple logic .
@RWPUSA i AGREE
@nl_strong Now you people are doing the same.
@kylegriffin1 @JoyAnnReid If he innocent he wouldn't need lawyers.
@CillizzaCNN You Americans have to find a way to stop this President. Canada is not even safe from this guy.
@CNNnewsroom Trump will do nothing guys....He's bought and payed for.
@CNNnewsroom Now if he could just stop cheating on her.
@themaxburns @JoyAnnReid Good puppy...
@_YourHighness00 @sanford17 What tell hell are parents teaching their kids today?
@RWPUSA @WSJ Big 22% Tariff on Canadian Newsprint .Is your President dumb enough to think that we won't respond.?
@GovNL @MAE_GovNL ''Three wise men"and a" Chicken Man" hehe
@JackSmithIV You should be ashamed of yourself man.
@meechkean @VOCMNEWS If they have so much money why not put some in the Corner Brook Hospital? Just more election goodies.
@CBCNL Come on folks, we gotta keep the collection plate full. Keep the billions flowing to the Vatican.
@jaketapper @WhiteHouse @PressSec It's Trump's dream to be elected like this. Complete power.
@CNN Yea, Guns have nothing o do with it .???
@GloriaBorger The WH is infested
What a cruel, vindictive thing to do. This man has earned his pension.  Watch now for the Mueller Investigation to be shut down.
With the McCabe firing we know the "Low Life" at Fox News  are jumping for joy.
@VoteTheGOPOut18 @OrussellRussell The man's a moron.
@foxandfriends You people are evil
@thehill The Russians are laughing at you people watching your Country go down the drain. CNN reports the truth. I gave up on Fox...too much spin.
@foxandfriends kEEP THE SPIN GOING GUYS.
@foxandfriends Your Country is going down the drain guys, keep up the SPIN,
@RWPUSA Amazingly stupid
@CNN How come these kids are smarter than your Gov.?
@CillizzaCNN Yea but he's an idiot...
The US Government just slapped  a  tariff of 22% on Canadian Paper mills.	Our local Mill here will probably shut down.
@CNN Wouldn't he have to start with her Husband ?
Yesterday in PA was another step  forward for the good old US of A.
@JimMFelton @LoraSomoza The kid is probably too smart for this WH.
@foxandfriends I agree with you Joy.
@ainsleyearhardt @foxandfriends Praying is just a way of pretending your doing something.
@TomiLahren @foxandfriends Talk about how your Country is going down the drain under Trump.
@CNN You Americans are the laughing stock of the world.
@SheldonP @2intimeofpeace The Rats have infiltrated the WH
@FoxNewsInsider @foxandfriends @DonaldJTrumpJr @SteveDoocy @ainsleyearhardt @kilmeade The rats are infiltrating the WH and you people at Fox News are responsibility.
@foxandfriends why would anyone spend time on this dribble?
@foxandfriends @michellemalkin Donald Trump is taking your Country back 100 years and you people are too stupid to see it.
@foxandfriends Yes and a lot of people are infected.
@foxandfriends The Russians are coming guys.Why don't you "DICK HEADS" smarten up?
@foxandfriends @dbongino Their attacking Trump because he's the President who should stop the "blame game" and start taking responsibility.
@foxandfriends Trump is the one whose above the law. Remember folks. He probably doesn't pay any taxes. If i were backing	 Trump i should be ashamed to call myself a "Christian'.
@foxandfriends @BillyHallowell Suck it up !!
@foxandfriends You 'DICK HEADS" Trump is President now and he's responsible now. Clue up.
@FoxNews Ur a ''DICK HEAD'' Tucker, do what we do in Canada, a  civilized culture, Start getting rid of certain guns.
@jaketapper Why do they bother, Trump will do what he wants anyway.
@foxandfriends They can't indite anyone without evidence. Trump is a better Russian than he is an American.
@foxandfriends Find another way to protest, only cowards disrespect the flag.
@foxandfriends That's because their reporting the truth
@RWPUSA About time we got those Religious nut cases out of our lives.
@foxandfriends Too bad you Republicans are all bought and paid for.
@CillizzaCNN Amazing..
@CNN Some should remind him that he's in charge now.
Mr Trump is also trying to put a tariff on Canadian Newsprint.
@foxandfriends @GovMikeHuckabee Saying your're Christian ,doesn't help your case.
@JoyAnnReid If a plane crash kills 200 people and only one survives,God will always get the credit for the one who survives but never the blame for the 200 who die.
@RWPUSA tAKES A LONG TIME FOR PEOPLE TO SMARTEN UP.
So many Americans have the "Archie Bunker mentally" when it comes to guns.
@jaketapper @JohnKasich @Sen_JoeManchin @CNNSotu Ask Kasich (on guns)what makes him so fucking stupid.
@nameless_savage @CNN More guns to solve the gun problem...what a dork
@chen621 @CNN Right on the money man.
@SheldonP Well, we know that's all he does is talk
@CillizzaCNN Whatever the NRA thinks.
@CNNnewsroom I wonder what he used for collateral?
Putting a tariff on Canadian Goods at the tune of 15-25 % will cause many business to shut down. Canada will not stand for this. Right now we do two billion dollars a  year in trade with the US.
@CNN Another bunch of idiots.
@foxandfriends @TomiLahren Your a 'DICK HEAD, " my dear. They are in bed with the Russians. And you're ok with that.?
@CNNnewsroom Not true.
@CNN @CNNOpinion LOL
@BlueJays @DunedinBlueJays I wonder how long Travis will be healthy.?
Little wonder you Americans have so much trouble with guns. Arming teachers is an idiotic idea. If you can solve your gun problems with more guns why don't you solve your Drug Problem a the same time by adding more drugs ??? Donald Trump, The NRA and the Russians have to go.
@foxandfriends You people are Dick Heads
@CNN Yea....Lapierre had to adjust his strings.
@funder Yes
The goings on in the White House..Is this real ? or are we watching a "Reality Show?"
@joshgremillion I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
@jaketapper @browardsheriff Just what you guys need, "another Trump"
@CillizzaCNN If you don't get rid of certain guns then you will never get rid of your problems.
@CNN Dick Head
@BarryWheeler @PCPartyNL Yes Barry and your Liberals continue to do the same.
@lindvey19 @hockeynight Great  job Team Canada
@CNN Trump will never offend the NRA or the Russians.
When i went to School i was terrified because my teacher carried a Strap. Can't imagine my Teacher carrying a gun.
@foxandfriends @robertjeffress Your a Christian because of where you were born.
Very sad what's going on in America today. Putting guns in schools will be a disaster. No leadership.
Watched the Town Hall last night and was very impressed. These kids were very mature. The battle is just beginning however as most of the Rep.are "bought and payed for" by the NRA. and your President will probably do nothing.  Please ,student's, don't give up.
@joncoopertweets I'd love to see his ass leaving the White House. Americans deserve better.
@CNN Chris..What's wrong in America today, you're looking it right in the face.
@CNN LOL..WHAT A JERK.
@JonahNRO @jaketapper Dick Head...
America is badly lacking leadership.
@CillizzaCNN Lets find out what hes hiding.
@sarahchad_ You'll be talking to a clown.
@CNN Then why is this not happening in other Countries????
@brianstelter @FLGovScott @tedcruz @marcorubio Gutless
@CillizzaCNN Guns ,guns and more guns. Shocking .
@CNNSitRoom @CNN @evanperez Will the WH ever take any responsibility ?
@sanford17 The slime on the slime.
@CNN Get trump the same way they All Capone..On tax evasion.
@jaketapper You people have a real problem and his name is "TRUMP"
@jaketapper Trump people ?
@BlueJays @RobertoOsuna1 Geeze,  hope they're not out o the playoffs after the first month this year
@CNN The world is getting sicker.
@CNN The President is a "CLOWN" and the Dems are weak. Shocking, We would never do this in Canada.
@MJGerson What's that brown spot on your nose Ryan ?
When will Trump ask for a statue of himself ?
@jaketapper Donald just needs to STROKE His ego.
@CillizzaCNN Trump calling someone else a "Liar"..lmao
Don't know what Donald and the people around him are trying to cover up but it must be "BIG".
@CNN He will. He's cornered and will pull out all the stops. I can't wait to find out what Putin has on him.
@CNN Trump will blame others...
@seanhannity The Republicans are in charge of everything. Trump is actually blaming his own "hand picked"people for all his troubles. All of trump's troubles are self inflected, He's contented to just blame everyone else. A leader who takes no responsibility  is no leader at all.
@JoyAnnReid You're going down man.The blame game can't last much longer.
@CNN i though this guy had the qualities to be President. Boy was i wrong.
@seanhannity Sean, The Russian President has your President by the Balls and your not at all concerned with what's going on ?Amazing.
@CillizzaCNN The three Stooges...
@CNN Pathetic...
@jaketapper Release Trump .
@CNN She's a "Professional" Liar
@BrianPSmyth @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Maybe he should pay some taxes ,like you and me.
@seanhannity Nothing more fake than Fox News. When Trump goes down you will look so silly.
@seanhannity Your a "dick head" man. If Donald Trump gets his way you will be living under a dictatorship .
@seanhannity Your sounding sillier every day. Try talking sense man.
Imagine the Pope angry about "fake News "...lol
@CNNTonight @CNN "Christians" are the last people i would try to reason with.
@CNN I hope this "dirt bag" gets a long sentence.
@CNN That's funny, the Pope condemning "fake news"
@CNN He and Trump have something in common...They don't pay any taxes.
@CNN Amazing
@CNN Shame on America. Donald Trump and his colleagues will stand and wave good-by as they are being deported. Shame on the Dems for letting this happen.
@BrookeBCNN Hi Brooke:  Watched your show earlier today. You have to take more control, Every one talking at the same time and i get nothing from the conversation. Good luck and thanks.
@CNN Dick Head
@CNN A leader who takes no responsibility is no leader at all.
@BlueJays @RGrich15 Left out all the times he struck out.
@MichaelFarber3 Remember him well.
@VOCMOpenline Just wait until these guys get re-elected and have that big fat Government pension in their back pocket. We will have to pay the price for all the spending the Liberals are doing now.
@CNN This girl is a master at SPIN.
@CNN Sounds like the president is 20 not 71. I liked the way this Dr. answered questions though.
I'm getting tired of the Americans telling us 'how great they are'.The most violent Country on Earth., Not safe to walk the streets, People in fear of their police, Guns in every hand. No decent health care system. and most off all a leader who is a RACIST CLOWN..Wake up America.
Trump's billionaire buddies got the big raise. Imagine, $11.00 an hr. for Walmart workers. What are they going to do with all that money??? Billionaires feeding the pigeons.
Oprah for President?......She might be too honest.
@maggieNYT @jaketapper Don't take any political savoy to tell the truth once in a while.
@rocco8113 @axios @jaketapper Love it...lol
@richeisen Sick..
@zachgoudie @CBCNL What nonsense..
@VOCMOpenline Religion itself is disgraceful ,in my opinion . Time for the Vatican to pack it in and leave people the hell alone.
I LOVE IT WHEN SOMEONES JUSTIFIES TRUMPS ACTIONS BY SAYING... "IT'S JUST TRUMP BEING TRUMP" imagine when Ted Bundy killed the last five girls if law enforcement had said...."It's just Ted being T	ed"
@VOCMOpenline Geeze Paddy, i wanted to say that. good one
@CNN Assault charges in Canada , so what ?. Since we don't have a justice system he.ll just be sent on his way with a little tap on the bottom and told to be a good boy. Canadian Justice,,,"what a joke '
@CNN What a bunch of bluffs.
@VOCMOpenline No Paddy: Not worth listening to.
@CNN I predict that the Trumps are going to fall hard.
@jaketapper @stevenmnuchin1 If we don't find what Mr Trump is trying to hide then we will always wonder. Let this investigation come to a proper end.
@CNN Why do this interview without someone there with a different take.
@jaketapper When he fires Mueller, he should be impeached.
When will Trump ban ''speaking  out against the Government"? Firing Mueller will be the first step to this end.
You have a President who loves Russians. We have a Prime Minister who loves Terrorists.
@NewDay Is Trump working himself up to fire Mulleur?
@dianenodwell Your President is a laughing stock to the rest of the world. Don't you want to know if he's a Russian spy? Let the FBI do their work to protect you Country and mine.
@CNNPolitics @CNN Her Moral values have gone down the toilet.
@andersoncooper  Yoy guys at CNN should look north for some news. We just payed an Isis soldier $10.5 million. Another ex'Gitmo is now sewing Canada for 50 million. Canada has also just brought back a bunch of Isis fighters to live right here in our Country. ???????

Mr. Michael Farber : An article on National pride and you omit a whole province. Ignorance or arrogance sir.?...Your choice.
