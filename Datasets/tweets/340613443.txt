The current spate of challenges to the NDAs could prove consequential: https://t.co/tRuZencU56
Trump lawyers have sought to aggressively enforce those agreements, despite a prevailing view from legal experts that they are not enforceable with respect to public officials. Omarosa Manigault Newman is one of several former employees now in protracted arbitrations: https://t.co/Y0sZ1ZkhR8

@Sickofyourbull_ @RealDylanFarrow @Babi_Engelhardt Absolutely untrue. She claims she met my mother many years later, as an adult. Alan she accuses of having sex with her as a minor.
And this story about AMI similarly going to elaborate lengths to buy and bury a claim from a Trump Organization doorman with information (of unclear veracity) about another Trump affair resulting in a child: https://t.co/iwy2lbaCpz https://t.co/k9CXConJnN
Also relevant: this report we went on to publish, with the first detailed behind-the-scenes account of AMI’s effort to “catch and kill” Karen McDougal’s story of an affair with Trump, and her first public statements about it: https://t.co/ThSnfEsJUO https://t.co/Xm4bK2exLz
In light of Bezos’s claims, worth returning to this story we did at @NewYorker, breaking the news that the same Enquirer editor Bezos dealt with was also behind a secret collaboration with Harvey Weinstein to dig up dirt on accusers: https://t.co/lPJM0cPc5n https://t.co/D6jxc88zDl
@JohnCarreyrou @WSJ @mrothfeld @joe_palazzolo They have done hugely important reporting and are always mentioned in the stories I do around AMI. Also important to recognize @JakePearsonProP and @JeffHorwitz for their work, sometimes in the face of considerable efforts to shut them down.

I and at least one other prominent journalist involved in breaking stories about the National Enquirer’s arrangement with Trump fielded similar “stop digging or we’ll ruin you” blackmail efforts from AMI. (I did not engage as I don’t cut deals with subjects of ongoing reporting.) https://t.co/kHQdWIkVjV
My column about confronting this as a brother and reporter was less significant than the women who publicly accused Woody Allen of sex crimes with minors (my sister @RealDylanFarrow, @Babi_Engelhardt) and disclosure of his diaries about underage girls (https://t.co/3kwByOXHCp). https://t.co/5Yy6ZFhQL8
@KhristieOC Very kind, thank you.
Finally, this reporting starts important conversations partly because of the hard work of @NatalieRaabe, who has put a spotlight on the stories and kept the record straight when powerful interests try to suppress or spin them.
The importance of truly excellent fact checkers in good investigative reporting cannot be overstated. None of my work would be possible without them. @SeanLavery @fergusmcintosh @nattythejourno. https://t.co/4TDmAYXXzz
And of course congrats to the great @JaneMayerNYer, with whom I was fortunate to collaborate on one of these stories, about Eric Schneiderman, and to our editor on that story, Daniel Zalewski, and to @MichelleBarish and the other sources who made that reporting possible.
Grateful to @dfmendelssohn @RohdeD, @michaelluo, @SeanLavery, @ParkertHenry, @NathanBurstein, Fabio Bertoni &amp; David Remnick, among others. And to @Illeanarama for getting the ball rolling and never wavering.

Note that the general thrust of Cohen lying to Congress “in accordance with” or “to support and advance” Trump’s agenda (per Cohen’s legal memo) is not in dispute. The source disputed the further, more specific idea that Trump issued—and memorialized—repeated direct instructions.
Buzzfeed has broken significant stories and has many excellent reporters. https://t.co/R5jcGfDxg5
I can’t speak to Buzzfeed’s sourcing, but, for what it’s worth, I declined to run with parts of the narrative they conveyed based on a source central to the story repeatedly disputing the idea that Trump directly issued orders of that kind.

The story might still be buried were it not for a community of reporters who worked on it tirelessly. That includes the powerful work of @jodikantor and @mega2e, who ran the first harassment allegations, and others who came close, like Ken Auletta, @kimmasters, and @benjwallace.
The New Yorker rescued this story when others sought to bury it and showed incredible courage in seeing it through. That took hard work from @dfmendelssohn, @RohdeD, @fergusmcintosh, @etammykim,	@nattythejourno, @NatalieRaabe, and @michaelluo, among many others.
Telling these stories—and weathering the intensive reporting needed to find witnesses and documents—often meant reliving the worst moments of a lifetime. @AnnabellSciorra did us all a service by speaking candidly about how hard her journey was: https://t.co/hbkCt092aW
The legal system propped up Weinstein’s efforts to suppress the story. I reported on his decades of non-disclosure agreements and the elite lawyers—like celebrated democratic attorney David Boies—who signed contracts with private spies and smeared women: https://t.co/ezFBIQvSfm
Another practice I reported in the same story: Weinstein, like Donald Trump, collaborated closely with the National Enquirer to gather dirt and suppress stories: https://t.co/gy2d1nfrfU
Many of the systems that kept the story quiet for years are still commanded by powerful people today. Weinstein used undercover operatives from the Israeli private intelligence firm Black Cube to track women with allegations and reporters on the story: https://t.co/lPJM0cPc5n
A year ago today, the New Yorker reported the first allegations of rape and sexual assault against Harvey Weinstein. 13 women I spoke to over the course of a 10 month investigation confronted fears for their safety and careers to make that story possible: https://t.co/7XKS6CotVP

She was one of many former and current CBS News employees who said there was a climate of sexism and harassment at the news network. For some of those employees, Fager remaining in place, alongside Moonves, has been a deterrent to reporting complaints. https://t.co/65QmLYEkmY
In my prior story, six current and former employees accused Jeff Fager, who formerly reported to Moonves as the chairman of CBS News and continues to run 60 Minutes, of inappropriate touching. A former 60 Minutes intern, Sarah Johansen, joined that group: https://t.co/SA2Bv5YkkK
Another massage therapist, from a different period in Los Angeles, made similar claims: https://t.co/DcpzVKf0q9
While most of the allegations come from executives and assistants, Moonves was also the subject of an apparent pattern of claims from massage therapists. Former managers at the Four Seasons in DC said so many massage therapists there complained, they had to warn Moonves: https://t.co/mNcoDu6iqD
Claims of retaliation and damaged careers run through several of the stories. Deborah Green says she was working with Moonves as a makeup artist when he asked her for a massage then forcibly kissed her. After she rebuffed him, she said her work with CBS execs abruptly stopped. https://t.co/fH73Cgfsxp
In separate later incidents, she said Moonves exposed himself to her in the office. The day after she rebuffed him, she says he violently threw her against a wall, leaving her in pain and crying on the floor. After that, she said Moonves destroyed her career: https://t.co/o6ndgSkI0R
Golden-Gottlieb, a veteran TV executive who is now retired and in her early eighties, says Moonves sexually assaulted her while she was working with him in 1986. https://t.co/a3LSxZTQTb
Some of the board was made aware of a police investigation into an allegation of forced oral sex and assault and battery in late January. That allegation was made by Phyllis Golden-Gottlieb, who was outraged the board didn’t do more. https://t.co/tSmtbBLOok
After the first allegations of misconduct last month, the CBS Board declined to suspend Moonves. Reports that the board was also in negotiations about his potential voluntary exit, accompanied by lavish compensation, were upsetting to many of the women with allegations. https://t.co/LBICaxhjCq
The allegations against Moonves include a range of non-consensual sexual acts as well as physical violence and retaliation. Women also continued to raise complaints about other parts of CBS, including claims about CBS News‘s Jeff Fager. https://t.co/ssijwAYP5r

@JusticeGirl2950 @matttbastard @Communigirl No use taking this up with mere writers like me. It is a famously arcane and peculiar style guide, fiercely guarded by the institution’s esteemed copy editors.
RT @APEntertainment: . @RonanFarrow tells @AP that CBS had "a very long window" to respond to his  investigative story on the company's chi…
Experts said that allegations at the top often echo across a company’s culture. The women who spoke about Moonves, Fager, and other powerful men at CBS were, in many cases, motivated by concern about those broader implications—and the potential that reform at the top could help. https://t.co/QsLmuAse0g
Fager, the 60 Minutes chief, waged a years-long battle to keep these allegations secret that included legal threats and efforts to discredit reporters working on the story, like the extraordinary @irin and @AmyJBrittain, much of whose work on the story was never published: https://t.co/OFcmdp4TtS
The @newyorker reviewed 3 settlement agreements in the 6-figure range with 60 Minutes employees who complained of harassment or discrimination. Some employees said the reliance on settlements and non disclosure agreements enabled abuse: https://t.co/3j4fbcgM9j
Many of them also said that there were few avenues though which to report abuse at CBS News, and several said that when people did, it resulted in retaliation. In one case, a CBS lawyer threatened to interfere with the career of a journalist who filed an EEOC complaint: https://t.co/8JXQ5LuYsz
@Communigirl @JusticeGirl2950 Nope. This is a NYer style guideline, not an error.

Some of the former and current employees said that Moonves protected Fager, and that Fager, in turn protected men who reported to him and were accused of assault and harassment. This contributed, they said, to an atmosphere some found hostile: https://t.co/MboToeaVSG
30 current &amp; former employees told me that the misconduct extended to other parts of the company, including CBS News. 19 said Jeff Fager, who runs 60 Minutes and whom Moonves at one point promoted to run the news division, enabled harassment. He also faces allegations of his own: https://t.co/SSs0piTz3C
All the women said that they felt their careers had suffered. Douglas, who later secured a settlement from CBS (the @NewYorker reviewed the underlying documentation and communications), was fired from her CBS deal after the alleged incident. https://t.co/JZe8Ww2NCl
Janet Jones, a writer, said that after a meeting in which she alleged Moonves threw himself on top of her, he called her and threatened to destroy her career (her account was backed up by several individuals involved at the time): https://t.co/W6hlqy4RDd
Several of the women said that the most scarring aspect of their experiences was what they alleged were aggressive threats of retaliation. Douglas said Moonves backed her against a wall and physically menaced her as she tried to leave: https://t.co/72czr8fp40
The allegations against Moonves took place as recently as the late 2000s. They include two cases in which women said they were pinned down and struggled to get away from Moonves, including this story from Illeana Douglas: https://t.co/oTPaLKHgPi

@JasonLeopold Numerous FinCEN officials with intimate knowledge of the database and prosecutors responsible for those LE efforts disagree with that characterization.
Note that it is, by all accounts, incredibly unusual to quarantine SARs in this way, and the fact that some but not all were suppressed suggests there are important disclosures still to come about Cohen’s transactions.
That’s also the explanation in original story: “FinCEN may have restricted access to the reports due to the sensitivity of their content”/“it may be that someone reached out to FinCEN to ask to limit disclosure of certain SARs related to an investigation.” https://t.co/V0tGJkodOg https://t.co/BwyUiUkB2P

@edkrayewski @PeterMDavies80 @jamiedupree You have to be more granular than that. There’s no “most people.” There are stakeholders within the government fighting to create accountability and others (more powerful ones) fighting to preserve expedient relationships with bad actors that hurt long-term strategic interests.
@edkrayewski @PeterMDavies80 @jamiedupree Ed, you’ve clearly taken no time to read any of my foreign policy writing, which is highly critical of our foreign policy posture and much of which is devoted to explaining the dangers of our dirty deals with dictators over many decades.
@edkrayewski @jamiedupree This is obviously a willful misreading of my point, which was about NK diplomacy.

Disclosing the existence of suspicious activity reports carries strict criminal and civil penalties—including up to five years in prison. The whistleblower behind the disclosures knew of the risks but felt it was important that there be public scrutiny: https://t.co/kzBTLV4Jyr
The report that has been made public gives clues on what might be in the unaccounted for ones—investigators at Cohen’s bank were looking at foreign transactions, including ones with Russia connections. https://t.co/8SPV2njOC1
Experts deeply experienced with that database agreed this was extremely unusual, and said the most likely explanation was that the contents of those two reports on Cohen were so sensitive that access had been restricted. https://t.co/PtogKfiMTO
The government maintains a database that typically includes all such records. But the whistleblower said an exhaustive search turned up not a trace of the two larger suspicious activity reports. https://t.co/7JJtZj4cDZ
The document that’s been making news over the past week is a “suspicious activity report”—the document filed by banks with the Treasury to flag potentially criminal activity. But it’s actually one of three—the smallest of them. https://t.co/zaXNEnmptM
The whistleblower who leaked Michael Cohen’s financial records is stepping forward to say why: records of bigger, potentially more sensitive, swaths of suspicious transactions appeared to be missing from a government database. My @newyorker investigation: https://t.co/5nR2CHNOUc

The passage where I return to Afghanistan to crack that mystery is one of the most important in the book to me personally, as it pays tribute to years of courageous, important work by @P4HR, risking life and limb to find evidence &amp; making it hard for US leaders to ignore abuses.
For anyone who followed the story of the mass grave at Dasht-e-Leili and the allegations that both the Bush and Obama administrations obstructed efforts to investigate, #WARONPEACE contains a new body of evidence and an interesting confession from the prime suspect. https://t.co/H00vLkW2dt

@__Arthur_Dent__ Thank you! Means a lot.
There is a lot more to this saga—from the stories of the brave diplomats whose lives are being torn apart to my own experience in Afghanistan and Pakistan watching one of the last greats of the profession fall. Order #WARONPEACE here: https://t.co/CzyMYbBmIM
@KathleenMulcah3 *hastily slips time-turner in suit pocket*
Many Secretaries stressed the long term—potentially multi-generational—implications of eviscerating America’s ability to make peace and negotiate. Colin Powell, who appeared deeply upset by the denigration of diplomats, said the Trump administration is “mortgaging your future.” https://t.co/2nQwtvlRZz
Every living former Secretary of State went on the record for #WARONPEACE. Many were scathing about the Trump administration, about the crisis of diplomacy, and about Tillerson. George P. Shultz, at age 97, said: “You can turn a job down.” https://t.co/vXNsTogeN8
Tillerson, for the first time, admitted to me that he fought back against the cuts behind the scenes, and said his defense of them on the Hill was partly due to his inexperience in the job: https://t.co/s93Y1UnmKa
At one point, as Tillerson embraced nearly unprecedented budget cuts to the State Department, his relations on the Hill got so bad that a prominent Republican Senator called the White House and threatened to subpoena him: https://t.co/w5H85EJaCp
Tillerson suggested that he knew the White House was engineering his demise. He and those around him appeared to point the finger at Jared Kushner and another senior official. Tillerson and Kushner were essentially at war by the end: https://t.co/8ZXzxQHUKJ
Tillerson, likewise, was scathing about a White House he called “very slow, very cumbersome,” and accused of “sitting in idle.” He said he begged them to fill empty State Dept roles to no avail: https://t.co/6C6CeLNf7X
Things soured between the White House and Tillerson. WH sources unloaded on Tillerson—one calling Tillerson’s conduct “self-mutilation,” claiming Trump found Tillerson’s “rage” against Nikki Haley “shocking,” and saying Tillerson, unlike Mattis, never learned to suck up to Trump: https://t.co/QjjU5BThnm
The Trump administration is wiping out diplomacy. Tillerson initially appeared to be ideally suited to that job—he isolated himself from his Department and even refused to take calls from from foreign leaders when we bombed Syria. https://t.co/P92rnZdALs

@yashar Thank you for always supporting fellow journalists, Yashar.
Legal experts said the payment was potentially relevant both from an election law standpoint and to ongoing criminal probes: https://t.co/wAkc95e4yb
When AP got close to breaking this last year, AMI hired a high-powered team to quash the story, including Clinton confidant Lanny Davis, who did similar lobbying for Harvey Weinstein. AP also reported Boies Schiller (also behind similar work for Weinstein) threatened them. https://t.co/e1c8h5hi6D
I report claims that Michael Cohen, Trump’s attorney, was personally involved. https://t.co/vnhg8txcKB
Regardless of the veracity of the underlying claim, legal experts said this was significant in that it establishes a pattern. https://t.co/Xu1eUvGt4D
In late 2015, the parent company of the National Enquirer, AMI—whose CEO, David Pecker, is a close ally of Trump’s—paid a former Trump Tower doorman $30,000 for the rights to a shaky claim, then added what sources said was an unusual $1,000,000 penalty if he ever disclosed it. https://t.co/vimJuFQQn6

Six former employees of AMI, the media company that purchased the exclusive rights to McDougal’s story, said that purchasing stories to bury them was a tactic favored by the company, and that it afforded influence over the subjects of the story - in this case, the President. https://t.co/gBENVKr9cd
McDougal is clear that the affair was completely consensual. However, she eventually ended it over feelings of guilt. Several instances of what she considered to be disrespectful behavior also factored into that decision, including a racially charged vulgarity: https://t.co/3hRXVNLm7I
But some of their interactions were also brazen. McDougal claims she met and posed for picture with Trump’s family, and was shown Melania Trump’s bedroom during a stay at Trump Tower. https://t.co/EoHzbGZEZZ
McDougal‘s story suggests a considerable effort to conceal the affair, including her claim that Trump secretly reimbursed her for travel. https://t.co/fAO3F7n8g7
Karen McDougal’s account of an affair with Trump that began several months after his son Barron was born shares many similarities with the stories of other women who have described consensual relationships or alleged sexual harassment by him. That includes offering money for sex: https://t.co/GJj6HE2omU
One woman’s detailed account of an affair and dozens of pages of documents reveal patterns in Donald Trump’s behavior with women—and an elaborate system of payoffs and intermediaries used to silence women with stories about him. My new @NewYorker story: https://t.co/ThSnfEsJUO
The world lost a hero today. I worked on and off with Asma Jahangir for 9 years. I never met anyone braver. When we last spoke in 2017, she warned me that "the space to speak up is shrinking." She died fighting for that space. Learn from her legacy: https://t.co/Sxd8CX9qTQ
This is worth reading for anyone trying to understand the scourge of domestic abuse. Holderness makes an important point about not just physical violence but also the subtler forms of psychological abuse that can strip a spouse of dignity and self-worth. https://t.co/aFezrB4ECd
@chrissyteigen She had to raise Mabel herself when their parents died. Every woman has a story, even hedgehog women in between selling us hats.
cc Noted Animal Crossing specialist @chrissyteigen.
This wistful little vignette about a woman’s heartbreak, and about aging and changing, is buried in a game that’s mostly about catching bugs and decorating your house. You only hear it if you’re patient and persistent and give her a lot of space to open up.
In Animal Crossing: Wild World, a Nintendo game simulating life in a village of cheerful cartoon animals, the town seamstress, Sable the hedgehog, sometimes gets sad in January. If you press her, she tells this story about Tom Nook, the raccoon proprietor of the general store: https://t.co/Bclchb5xK3
“He’s a conservative politician who loves school vouchers and can’t get a meeting with his favorite gay athlete. She’s the sister of an unhinged strongman in control of a deadly nuclear arsenal. They fight crime!“ https://t.co/tO3BK9EsYF https://t.co/LjrzAiHaO7

Moreover, talks *on* NK just as important as talks *with* NK. Deal w/ China may be best hope &amp; China says it wants to reopen 6 party talks.
Though North Korea is more resistant than before, the idea that it simply cannot be negotiated with is at odds with the historical record.
Obama abandoned negotiation on NK completely &amp; there's a pretty good case to be made that doing so exacerbated the situation, as seen today.
Bush efforts suffered bc they abandoned that progress for 1st term. Still their 6 party talks got pretty far and yielded some transparency.

@amnesty And yeah, I know I accepted a scholarship started by Cecil Rhodes. I have zero ethical misgivings about that.		/end thread
@amnesty Do not let your partner get you a diamond. If you think it's okay to wear a diamond, you've been duped by one company's cynical marketing.
@amnesty Almost impossible to trace a cut diamond's origin; ethical diamonds are a mirage. Diamond mines employ some, but destroy even more lives.
@amnesty Kimberley process is full of loopholes; blood diamonds still make it to market. Plus Kimberley doesn't even look at deadly labor conditions.

@wmdtek @ShellenbergerMD @JimConca @MichaelPLight @SFrameK5 Absolutely false. Those are all payments for cases of illness and death DoL linked to work at the site.
@JimConca @ShellenbergerMD @MichaelPLight @SFrameK5 Confused by this claim. There is a documented cancer cluster downwind.
@JimConca @ShellenbergerMD @MichaelPLight @SFrameK5 I'd point out - this story was never just about rads. The chemical threat is given just as prominent billing in our coverage.
@ShellenbergerMD @JimConca @MichaelPLight @SFrameK5 Yes - some of the conditions of workers we interviewed are specifically linked to radiation, some are likely due to chemical contaminants
@ShellenbergerMD @RemyDeVoe @JimConca @MichaelPLight @SFrameK5 Did you try literally googling the headlines shown in the story? It received widespread coverage.
@ShellenbergerMD @JimConca @MichaelPLight @SFrameK5 (Also discussed in story)
@ShellenbergerMD @JimConca @MichaelPLight @SFrameK5 If you are asking for scientific studies - how about the hundreds of pages of surveys commissioned by DoE showing dangers at the site?
@ShellenbergerMD @JimConca @MichaelPLight @SFrameK5 Absolutely - doctors make determinations of causation all the time, which are used in a legal context and were used by DoL.
@ShellenbergerMD @RemyDeVoe @JimConca @MichaelPLight @SFrameK5 Respectfully - articles about it are shown in the story, which you say you've watched. It's very easy to Google them.
@JimConca @ShellenbergerMD @MichaelPLight @SFrameK5 I'll be frank - what I saw in my reporting was the opposite. Numerous uncompensated claims w persuasive medical records suggesting causation
@ShellenbergerMD @RemyDeVoe @JimConca @MichaelPLight @SFrameK5 Tank explosion w/ particulate matter entering air and contaminating large area was raised by govt nuclear board as a serious possibility
@ShellenbergerMD @RemyDeVoe @JimConca @MichaelPLight @SFrameK5 The Chernobyl quote, from fmr Gov Gary Locke, was about potential for a large area of contamination, not specific mechanism of contamination
@ShellenbergerMD @RemyDeVoe @JimConca @MichaelPLight @SFrameK5 Tank explosion due to pressure &amp;  structural weakness is one possibility raised by experts/discussed in story. Which I'd recommend watching.
@RemyDeVoe @ShellenbergerMD @JimConca @MichaelPLight @SFrameK5 These aren't random illnesses and deaths. They're ones where Dept of Labor determined there was a causal link to work at site and paid out.
@ShellenbergerMD @JimConca @MichaelPLight @SFrameK5 Yup - our claim was framed very specifically. These are claims DoL considered sufficiently causally linked to compensate.
@ShellenbergerMD @JimConca @MichaelPLight @SFrameK5 If you watch story, we also name several known specific cases of deaths of workers.
@ShellenbergerMD @JimConca @MichaelPLight @SFrameK5 Workers' documents show a specific range of compensation for illness. That range doesn't account for total $ without larger death claims.
@ShellenbergerMD @JimConca @MichaelPLight @SFrameK5 DoL deliberately won't break out that data but we know there are deaths based on crosschecking $ figure and # of claims.
@ShellenbergerMD @JimConca @MichaelPLight @SFrameK5 As to causation - the story discusses several cases in which doctors say firmly there was causal link but govt and insurers covered up.
@ShellenbergerMD @JimConca @MichaelPLight @SFrameK5 How we phrased it is accurate. These are deaths and illnesses while working at site, for which DoL compensated them or their next of kin.

Instead of Dr Phil, watch the work of lovely Shelley Duvall, who gave us much over the years. And made this exist: https://t.co/oU7DvkHz5O
Don't support the exploitation of vulnerable people. Don't watch Dr Phil.
When people sell exploitation it lessens all of us. When we fail to protect people at their most vulnerable it hurts all of us.
I hope that should I ever be broken or vulnerable, other interviewers would afford me that same compassion.
When someone is broken on camera, I strive to show only what's absolutely needed to tell an important story-and to safeguard their dignity.
Interviewers sometimes must show suffering. It's our ethical responsibility to do so with compassion. Duvall appears to have been shown none
Dr Phil's exploitation of the wonderful Shelley Duvall--masquerading as "powerful TV"--is shameful. She's a treasure. She deserves respect.
