@realDonaldTrump Where's the 1 million dollars you promised.
@realDonaldTrump Democrats voted to save the ACA which covers pre-existing conditions, republicans actively try to take that away. You chant repeal and replace, that replacement wont over pre-existing conditions.

It has gotten to a point in this country that I am scared to go to school. Even though I have 2 days left a lot can happen in 2 days. The fact that anyone is fearing for their life when they enter a school is absurd. I have figured out plans in each room Incase shots are fired.
@zionkelly18 what office do you hold
@elonmusk The offline dinosaur game.
@Guitanguran Filth, god had nothing to do with the shooting. He doesn‚Äôt even exist, it‚Äôs mental health and gun reform that will change our gun problem.
Gun violence in this country is insane. More people are killed in the US because of guns than in any other place in the world. We have to do something to change that. If our lawmakers won‚Äôt do anything they won‚Äôt be lawmakers much longer. #guncontrol #SanteFeHighSchool #BlueWave

Today is a great day for our democracy and a safe and free internet. The Senate passed a bill that would protect #NetNeutralty from Ajit Pai and the FCC. I think we need to hold off with the house vote until after midterms so that democrats can pass this bill.
Even though I can‚Äôt vote yet, I can still voice my opinion and who I think should win elections domestically. I would vote for @LValentineOH. She believes in 1. A fair and effective school system 2. affordable healthcare 3. Creating jobs. As a Democrat I believe in these policies
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump You don‚Äôt speak for more than 60 percent
@RepBillFlores hey you should not accept money from the NRA. It is an organization that bribes congress not to pass gun reform.
Congress can revoke a statehood, and I think they should revoke Utah‚Äôs statehood until they can separate church and state more effectively. Right now if the LDS church says anything it will become law in the legislature. #revoke #utah
@roadworkaheadx Congress can do it
@roadworkaheadx Yes you can
Haha I can‚Äôt even. https://t.co/HbYSRYj6x4
All of them, the operates the way the church wants it to, that means that we can‚Äôt get any good legislation passed to protect our citizenship
Utah is such a corrupt state with the LDS church having almost endless control over the state government. In my opinion Utah needs to have its statehood revoked until it can have the separation of church and state wider. No profit organization should have this much power.

@BrennanCGreen @pink_lady56 @Kdubinaz Wrong, fascism is a form of the alt right.
@realDonaldTrump It is not record clean air and water because of him, it is because of the previous administration. Scott Pruitt has only made our environment worse. Remove him from your cabinet or you will be removed from office.#FirePruitt #resist #ImpeachTrump

@Minecraft you guys should add elephants and giraffes and zebras to Minecraft. You should make them drop nothing so people don‚Äôt get used to killing those animals. Make them harmless.
