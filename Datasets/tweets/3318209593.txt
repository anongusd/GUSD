@hinkyaz @kmclea8 @upcountrydesign @costareports @SoSofieFatale That is the full paragraph from the introduction to Paxton's Anatomy of Fascism, a text that wholly refutes D'Souza's idiotic claim that Nazis were somehow on the left.	😂😂😂😂😂

UR not just misinformed,UR willfully ignorant.	UR a disgrace.	https://t.co/xZAF0OnSrc
@Zebop @tomwatson 6/ No gotcha questions re of Bernie, Kamala,etc...if they were the nominee would you vote for them.	It is simple...will U vote 4 the Dem presidential candidate. That is the only relevant question. Will U vote for state Dems. RU part of the #Resistance or RU part of the problem.
@Zebop @tomwatson 5/ We all should come to the simple conclusion that we can scrutinize &amp;support who we want in the primaries, but when the nominee is made...we all need 2rally behind that candidate &amp; other state candidates,to take back the WH &amp; Senate.
@Zebop @tomwatson 4/I am not negating Bernie,	I am just pointing out that he isn’t the only civil rights proponent.	Hillary Clinton will B inducted into the Women’s Hall of Fame at the National Voting Rights Museum &amp; will be awarded the International Unity Award during the Sunday morning breakfast
@Zebop @tomwatson 3/So let that sink in for the Bernie supporters who use his civil rights activism in college as his cred.	Bernie is “speaking” at the Unity Breakfast that HRC is being HONORED 4 her  civil rights work	🤔	#contextMatters	#weAgreeMoreThanWeDisagree
@Zebop @tomwatson 2/The context being that they are demonstrating the concerning fact that Bernie is too old, and the other contextual point they are ignoring is that Hillary Clinton is the person being HONORED at the King Unity Breakfast. Bernie is just speaking, along w/other 2020 candidates.
@Zebop @tomwatson 1/What I find curious is the very selective vision@Bernie zealot talking points “that no other candidate was arrested for protesting in their 20’s” and he was invited to speak at the King Unity Breakfast.	Saying these as positive points and ignoring the context.	#contextMatters
@hinkyaz @upcountrydesign @costareports @SoSofieFatale UR completely misinformed.

@arbovinae @hanakimee @tomwatson Cheers.	Together we can make a difference. We can agree &amp; disagree productively with the sharing of as much information and ideas we can muster to fight disinformation, scrutinize all candidates and tweet are ideas to get to the best solutions we are capable of executing🙂
@arbovinae @hanakimee @tomwatson No,we agree. In fact we agree on many issues.	The difference is that in Kamala I recognize someone who isn’t just talk and promises. She gets things done, and does it by not living in a bubble.🙂	Kamala and her sister Maya have been getting things done for a long time 🙂
@arbovinae @hanakimee @tomwatson 3/In 2014, she co-sponsored a bill to outlaw the “gay-panic defense” in California-a legal strategy that often shielded perpetrators of violent crimes against LGBT people from serious punishment.
@arbovinae @hanakimee @tomwatson 2/In 2012, she helped win a massive $25 billion settlement w/Wells Fargo &amp;other financial institutions for foreclosure abuses...	but a year later she declined to prosecute Steven Mnuchin’s OneWest Bank for foreclosure violations.😔
@arbovinae @hanakimee @tomwatson 1/Kamala Harris balancing of job and social progressivism...sometimes were more successfully than others. As San Francisco’s DA, she steadfastly refused to seek the death penalty against a man accused of killing a police officer,but maintained CA right to capital punishment.
@arbovinae @hanakimee @tomwatson I think your heart is in the right place... but you are not seeing Kamala in context.	Cheers🙂	#goodLuck 🙂

@arbovinae @hanakimee @tomwatson She didn’t pursue these injustices, she did her job as a prosecuting attorney. And set out to address these injustices with her sister Maya Harris.

@ArtbyKGH @SallyAlbright @chelseallyn @bubblegenius @MommaTNYC @davequast You do realize that you are being ridiculous.	AOC has a set allowance, if she chooses to intentionally overpay her “junior” staff ... her “good intentions” are fiscally irresponsible. Her congressional allowance is not fluid.	#realityCheck

@ArtbyKGH @chelseallyn @bubblegenius @MommaTNYC @SallyAlbright @davequast 🙂	According to Glassdoor-	House staffers avg pay $30K-50K;scale is based upon experience &amp;merit.

11/This exchange ended in him blocking me.Which is fine.	But what isn’t fine is that he never took the time 2 address the facts...ever, during this engagement.	He is a veteran,&amp;presumably sacrificed 4 the very Constitution that he now ignores when it doesn’t suit his narrative.

@BawstonBoy @JoyceeMarshall @____wells____ 5/Of note, to play devils advocate regarding viewership numbers...younger demographic viewers are streaming sports and their viewership in not tallied with the tradition viewership statistics that are currently used.	#contextMatters	#stopThinkingBackwards
@BawstonBoy @JoyceeMarshall @____wells____ 4/There is a similar trend in Super Bowl ratings, with the adults 18-49 demographic declining 6 straight years!	This year’s 33.4 rating in the demo was the lowest since 2005 &amp; the second-lowest since at least 1992.	#factsMatter	#iKneelSoOthersCanStand
@BawstonBoy @JoyceeMarshall @____wells____ 3/2017 was the 6th straight yr ratings have declined in adults 18-34 &amp; the 7th straight in adults 18-49.	When young demos are declining in an otherwise strong year, it indicates erosion that is immune even to a rising short term rises.	This has NOTHING 2do w/taking a knee.
@BawstonBoy @JoyceeMarshall @____wells____ 2/NFL viewership highlights&gt;	2003-adults 18-34 fell 14 %	2008-adults 18-34 fell 8%	2 straight years of declines in 2011 &amp; 2012.	2013, 2014 and 2015 increase was due to moving half of the Thursday Night Football schedule to broadcast television.	2014 w/out Thursday was in decline
@BawstonBoy @JoyceeMarshall @____wells____ 1/NFL has dramatic viewership has been declining since 2000,well before #takeAKnee movement. 2008 was the least-watched NFL season since 2008 (14.6M).	&amp; viewership actually increased 5% in 2018 .	#factsMatter	(Suggest that Udon’t mess w/a real sports fan)	#ikneelSoOthersCanStand

@BawstonBoy @JoyceeMarshall @____wells____ 6/The title of police Officer doesn’t command respect.	The exercise of a police officer who protects &amp; serves their community,commands respect.
@BawstonBoy @JoyceeMarshall @____wells____ 5/It escalated because police departments were militarized.$ spent on “overly”weaponzing departments rather than investing in quality personnel &amp; community liaison projects. Police,teachers,firefighters, EMTs,Social workers...all R in positions that deserve scrutiny &amp; better pay.
@BawstonBoy @JoyceeMarshall @____wells____ 4/&amp; if U sincerely think that kneeling during the anthem creates/escalates a natl divide then U weren’t paying attention B4 they kneeled.#notSurprised	It existed &amp; escalated via a lack of police transparency &amp; accountability,&amp; the gaslighting of victims &amp; their families.

@lennoxesq @VABVOX 3/The point of the Electoral College was to serve as a filter,so as a more informed representative group could then vet the popular vote &amp;chose the most qualified candidate.	In modern practice the Electoral College is a formality,electoral members R loyalist chosen by their party
@lennoxesq @VABVOX 2/The framers didn’t TRUST direct democracy. Madison feared the“tyranny of the majority”	Hamilton wrote that the Constitution is designed 2 ensure”the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed w/the requisite qualifications”

@Villide1 @_memorable2 @JamilSmith @AOC @60Minutes That is fair position.	AOC being interviewed as part of a panel of the new WOC in Congress would have shown strength of the new political direction as well as a buffer for missteps.	She wasn’t prepared. But she wasn’t timid either🙂
@Villide1 @_memorable2 @JamilSmith @AOC @60Minutes This wasn’t a“dealbreaker” 4me,but was still wrong.I also have no problem w/her supporting candidates the DNC don’t have on their short list. I do have issues w/the canned attacks in Dems/Ind ⭕️ “corporate”,”centrist”, ”lefty”,”socialist”,etc...	we can disagree &amp; still B United🌊
@Villide1 @_memorable2 @JamilSmith @AOC @60Minutes True.	But we should B able 2 expect competence &amp; accountability. I think on the left we do demand more, &amp; Puritan politics is absolute bullshit...I don’t want 2agree w/everyone, &amp;dismiss those I don’t agree with. Good ideas do not come from a vacuum🙂

@_memorable2 @Villide1 @JamilSmith @AOC @60Minutes Yep I read this and disagreed with it... she should support anyone she wants in the primaries...the more people we have sharing good ideas...the more material we have for a solid platform.
@_memorable2 @Villide1 @JamilSmith @AOC @60Minutes 3/Ucan call me names, U think”centrist”is an insult..I get all sorts of new racial, misogynistic &amp; political slurs thrown @ me.	I will keep scrutinizing &amp; supporting AOC,just as I will others.	U can keep 🍒 pick my posts &amp; not read all of them 2 fuel UR fast food twitter rants🍔

AOC,just as any other woman, doesn’t have the luxury of being human. Women have 2B twice as good 2 get half the respect
@_memorable2 @Villide1 @JamilSmith @AOC @60Minutes 1/I agree...but that doesn’t mean that she shouldn’t be informed &amp; f’n prepared w/facts!	Do U want her 2be R sides version Sarah Palin?	She is on the right side morally,no question...	but the facts matter even more in this climate of misinformation!&amp;I won’t let that shit slide!
@_memorable2 @Villide1 @JamilSmith @AOC @60Minutes 3/&amp;funny how U cherry picked the post where I said the article was rubbish,but ignore the post where I defended her.	#notSurprised.
@_memorable2 @Villide1 @JamilSmith @AOC @60Minutes No,today &amp; everyday everyone needs to hold AOC &amp; other politicians accountable...so she will not undermine her credibility or the credibility of the issues.	The fact that U ignore my posts supporting her&amp; only focus on the ones where I call her out...undermines UR argument.
@_memorable2 @Villide1 @JamilSmith @AOC @60Minutes 2/I am arguing that not being prepared &amp;using fake facts to support an agenda I also support undermines the issue &amp; her credibility,&amp;that I will keep demanding facts B attended 2,that they R important &amp;that when going on natl tv...2promote the agenda,2B prepared &amp; know the facts
@_memorable2 @Villide1 @JamilSmith @AOC @60Minutes 1/FYI...I am currently downloading the entire transcript for the 60minutes interview...as well as some of her campaign stumps/interviews...so this will take some time.	You are arguing she apologized for being wrong...so that makes it ok.	#factsMatter
@_memorable2 @Villide1 @JamilSmith @AOC @60Minutes 1/🙂I have the  reasonable expectation that she will be well informed &amp; not act like the dog ate her homework when called out.	This devalues our support for her &amp; the issues...facts matter!	I will keep scrutinizing &amp; demanding R legislatures be factual informed!	🙂
@_memorable2 @Villide1 @JamilSmith @AOC @60Minutes Funny how you omit the false information she quoted in the transcript, stats that she has said before...	I have been defending her in the stance of living wage, trump being a racist...	but I will not accept anyone saying facts R unimportant, fabricating them &amp; devaluing the issue
@_memorable2 @Villide1 @JamilSmith @AOC @60Minutes I didn’t say I was wrong about anything...I said that her apology was not the problem...that her lack of perpetration,her repeating fabricated facts ( lies misinfo) that she didn’t take the time to research and have the facts...that all this deserved the scrutiny it received!
@_memorable2 @Villide1 @JamilSmith @AOC @60Minutes My https://t.co/9wKat4Bwic don’t see it. If you don’t call her out and support her by demanding she be more prepared, more informed ...everything she stands for is just noise!	She can do better! And I hope she does.

@Alt_LeftAlabama @_memorable2 @markos @dailykos @SpeakerPelosi 2/we have to focus helping via our local communities...because the scale of this problem is too big!l 4 a donation page.

Why do you not get this!!!	I am sorry, but I am done herding cats.	The #TrumpShutDown affects pretty much everyone...so you can’t crowdfund a page for it.
@Alt_LeftAlabama @_memorable2 @markos @dailykos @SpeakerPelosi Omg, did you read the donation page?!	Donors were sending Pelosi a thank you.	It is just an exercise of free speech.	They also did pages to send Obama,Bernie,Warren,Harris,etc birthday cards...	Please stop being distracted and prioritizing nonsense...

@_memorable2 @Alt_LeftAlabama @markos @dailykos @SpeakerPelosi 3/The only real help we can give people affected by the #TrumpShutDown is locally.	It has to be communities helping each other out, because Drumpf &amp; McConnell don’t give a shit...	and general crowdsourcing of funds for such a broad group of people affected will be ineffective
@_memorable2 @Alt_LeftAlabama @markos @dailykos @SpeakerPelosi 2/the donation page for the roses is by individuals who wanted to thank Pelosi...an extension of their freedom of speech.	Now re helping people affected by the #TrumpShutdown...a daily Kos donation page won’t do that! It affects so many dif groups,it is a logistical nightmare.
@_memorable2 @Alt_LeftAlabama @markos @dailykos @SpeakerPelosi 1/This is what kills me...	a complete lack of common sense, but a wealth of bullshit unfounded judgement by those whose only contribution is complaining.

12/&amp; what is even more #trumpesque is that #donTheCon basically wants $5 billion for a fence that we already have and have established legislation &amp; budget for it’s maintenance and for further construction of its extension.	#donTheCon	#trumpWallScam	#trumpShutdown	#trumpFail
11/The 2006 Secure Fence Act authorized the construction of several hundred miles of fencing (“steel see-through wall” in #TrumpSpeak)along the border(but not a wall).	Schumer &amp; Dems did support this bill,4 a fence &amp; its maintenance.	So 🤡 now wants something we already have?🤔
10/...but now #Drumpf wants a “steel see-through wall”?	1st he wanted it because “he said”CBP wanted it,now he says it is also what Dems want.	Let’s be very clear about this“steel see-through wall”,it is a chain linked fence,which we already have along🇺🇸border in necessary areas.
9/“Sen. Chuck Schumer has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past."	#contextMatters and so does the presidential waiver if of his now “fluid” definition of as wall.	Trump wanted a big beautiful wall,had cement structures in mind, had a design competition.	#duhDrumpf
8/The economic benefits from the agreement (if it passes) will come in the form of lower tariffs for American companies or higher wages for American workers...it does not finance the wall.	#trumpEmptyPromises	#notWinning
7/ Oh this one is a doozy...	“The wall will also be paid for, indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico.”	#bottomlessPinocchio alert!	The revised North American Free Trade Agreement(United States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement)has yet to pass in Congress.
6/So U have traffic violations,U had some pot in UR pocket-UR lumped in w/violent criminals?	&amp;or U enter🇺🇸 illegally...it is a crime &amp;because it is a criminal conviction,UR also lumped in w/rapists+?	This is the political sideways speak equivalent of double jeopardy	#notSurprised
5/... of the ICE arrest of immigrants with “criminal convictions”... majority were non violent.	The most common charges were 4 traffic violations,possessing or selling drugs &amp; immigration offenses like illegal entry.	🤔...
4/“In the last two years, I.C.E. officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens w/criminal records.”	2017/2018 ICE arrested 210,876+ w/previous criminal convictions &amp; another 55,233 w/pending criminal charges,	many were NONVIOLENT.	#contextMatters
@DragonsAppear @Fedaykin2a According to the president’s opioids commission,it report in November stated that, “we are losing this fight predominately through China.”	🤔
@DragonsAppear @Fedaykin2a 2/...and also through Canada.	A lower potency, lower-cost grade of fentanyl is also smuggled across the southwest border from Mexico. The fentanyl directly from China is far more lucrative for sellers because of its higher purity.	(#45 shows no interest in a Northern wall🤔)
@DragonsAppear @Fedaykin2a 1/“Every week 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone, 90 percent of which flows across our southern border.” -#45	according to DEA’s latest National Drug Assessment report...most fentanyl enters🇺🇸from packages mailed directly from China through traditional ports of entry.

@dusm1811 @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC Wow... you have no idea what you are yltalking about.	Ok...so now you don’t support a 10% flat proportional tax...	U say you want everyone to have skin in the game, but not really...	U copy paste aggregate summary numbers that Udon’t understand...	#notSurprised but #disappointed
@dusm1811 @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC Paying the same dollar amount is equal.	Paying 10% is proportional.	Paying a sliding scale rate is progressive.
@dusm1811 @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC Proportion is a flat percentage, 	Progressive escalates...	Please take a basic Econ 101 class or at least pull out a dictionary...😂
@dusm1811 @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC 4/just break down the simple #s as I did 4U,dismissing aggregate data like averages&amp;aggregate total tax revenue...then C what the actual tax burden is on each economic level.	UR initial stance on 10% flat tax &amp; sales tax Rgood but U don’t get the context of the #s U copy/paste🙂
@dusm1811 @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC 3/ now regard sales tax... I am with you on that too... it is the easiest way to eleviate the burden on the poor. They can qualify to not pay sales tax in the similar way that non profits do.&amp; we can implement luxury taxes on extravagant items.	I suggest you do some # crunching
@dusm1811 @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC 2/...but as U said before everyone had to have skin in the game and people making 1million+ paying 0.1%  tax rate R not paying their equivalent tax burden ...	Now if they were paying the same proportional tax rate of a flat 10% as you said you support that 100x more tax revenue.
@dusm1811 @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC 1/U really don’t get it😂	top 20% of tax payers paying 80% of the tax revenue is no where near a flat 10% tax which is a proportional tax	if people at 1miilion+ are paying only 0.1%	&amp; people at 50-121k are paying ~30% of course the 1% are generating the bulk of tax revenue...
RT @DogginTrump: 😭😂🤣		Tlaib Apologizes For “Impeach The Motherfucker” Comment; Meant To Say “Imprison The Motherfucker” https://t.co/tETBqL…
@dusm1811 @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC 3/ The 1% being 1.21 million tax payers earning avg of $8.4 million and only paying 0.1% tax rate...that is trillions of dollars in tax revenue uncollected,shifting the burden to the middle and lower class...
@dusm1811 @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC To reiterate a flat tax is a proportional tax cut.
@dusm1811 @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC 2/your flat tax  of 10% is a proportional tax rate.	So currently the 1% income avg valuation is at about 8.4 million while the avg middle class income is at 121K (sorry couldn’t find mode data) so the top 1% encompasses ~1.2 million tax payers out of our 122 million tax payers
@dusm1811 @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC 1/You do realize that proportional tax cuts is the calculation of tax responsibility that you said in your first statement that you supported...	10% flat tax!	But now you are not concerned with that and are fine with the wealthiest 1% of our nation paying 0.1%  tax rate?!

@dusm1811 @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC Now your failed numerical logic regarding the more money you make means you get a larger tax cut is actually quaint.	We are talking proportional tax cuts ... and since you said you favor a flat tax rate,the fact that the tax cuts means the 1% is paying 0.1% ...should alarm U
@dusm1811 @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC Not true...if you file a W4 form you can delay the tax withholding payments deducted from your paycheck , but you stay pay FICA and you can not itemize deductions when you file.
@dusm1811 @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC A better # representing this tax cut disparity from the same WSJ article series is the top 1% will pay 0.1% of taxes!

@dusm1811 @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC 5/ Also keep in mind that this tax cut bill scales down for middle and lower class yearly and by 2027...	the avg tax cut 4 mid class would amount to $160, or just a 0.2 % income bump,which is so nominal a mode isn’t worth calculating,mid class will have $30 higher than today.
@dusm1811 @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC 4/The mode was $175 tax cut 4 the mid class &amp; affected 60% of the mid class which was actually a drop tax cuts 4 maj of middle class. The avg is just adding the lowest to the highest value &amp; dividing by 2 getting the $870 avg,of which only the upper 17% of the mid class benefited
@dusm1811 @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC 3/average takes into account extremes while a more accurate measure is mode...mode is a value that describes those who are affected the most within that spectrum.	within the average of the middle class tax bracket the mode...the value that happened the most often was $175...
@dusm1811 @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC 2/	households earning $1 million+ an average cut of $69,660,an income bump of 3.3 %	households earning $50,000 to $75,000 tax cut of $870, or 1.6 %	I would like to draw your attention to the term average...which is an incorrect term use to aupport or scrutinize the tax cut.
@dusm1811 @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC 1/Your 1st # saying 80% of all tax payers got a tax cut is not a positive since prior to this tax bill many lower income tax payers recieved less of a tax cut than before while many upper income received a bigger tax cut. https://t.co/CdTCc7iO8C

@Charles4Freedom @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC ...but there will still be a need 4health insurance to cover emergencies,long term hospital stays, specialized surgeries, mental illness facilities, rehab facilities,nursing homes for elderly/disabled/terminally ill,	we lower this cost by going back 2 health ins being not 4profit
@Charles4Freedom @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC The increased number of facilities nationwide...will create jobs to be filled by students who can have that education subsidized by our govt...in generating more tax revenue upon graduation filling those new vacancies. The increased access to healthcare lowers the cost...
@Charles4Freedom @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC Medicare for all, isn’t as costly as the GOP &amp; Atlas proclaim.The reason why&gt;it is not comprehensive healthcare.	It is basic healthcare,w/subsidized assurances of lower prescription drugs costs,increased availability of med facilities which lower costs &amp;in turn creating more jobs
@Charles4Freedom @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC Let’s just focus on one simple point that resonates with everyone...the COST of healthcare.	Ironically there are simple but in the short term painful solutions. But I will assume you have a modest amount of common sense and  actual believe in investing towards your future
@Charles4Freedom @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC He intentionsllly omitted the restructuring of the UK system...of which happened because there was an increased need 4 healthcare professionals.	But the maj of his statistics,as per usual with Americans taken out of the appropriate context &amp;put in terms that don’t translate here.
@Charles4Freedom @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC Of note the reason why I do not support single payer healthcare is purely because of scale... and as a system could only be implemented after the groundwork I outlined was established. Now re Scott W. Atlas who cites the UK system,	notice he rarely talks about Canada or France🤔
@Charles4Freedom @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC U need 2 reread my posts I never said I support single payer-in fact I said-expand Medicare,create direct healthcare cost tax deduction,subsidize &amp; dereg prescription costs.	U in turn said there were long lines in Canada &amp; UK 4 healthcare providers...which i pointed out is a lie
@dusm1811 @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC Not to be rude... but just because I am not affected by a problem, doesn’t mean the problem doesn’t exist.	I would suggest you think about how your whole family, community, our economy, our future is affected by the fact that maybe 1 or 2 yrs U did OK,what was the real cost.
@Charles4Freedom @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC This is a lie you have been fed.	As someone who has experienced healthcare in numerous countries...I have a personal range of experience.	But let me refer you to this YouTube snippet. And then I will explore you to look this doctors and others further...	https://t.co/xPyiLAP7za
@Charles4Freedom @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC Ucan’t t have upward mobility on min wage,because there is no physical way 2move upward-UR trapped by debt,geography,lack of educ,&amp;or health because Ucouldn’t afford the basics  or have time 4 basic self care.	Living wage encourages upward mobility &amp;lessens need 4social programs
@Charles4Freedom @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC Having a living wage reduces the need 4 food stamps and other social programs...we essentially stop the corp welfare model ( read up on Walmart)...&amp; the 💰 we save on the lower need 4 food stamps/social programs we use to subsidize small businesses providing that living wage🙂
@Charles4Freedom @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC It is common sense 2 requiring a living wage.	A living wage ensures that even the lower paying jobs in a community R filled.People who can work 40hrs a week &amp; maintain a healthy living.This increases productivity. It also results in lower crime rates &amp; emergency healthcare costs
@Charles4Freedom @NigeSecurityGuy @60Minutes @AOC ...But he had a good paying job that afforded him the opportunity to pay to get the degree/career he eventually wanted.	Americans look at the word FREE and assume there R no hoops to jump through.	It doesn’t translate correctly.

@EdKrassen @SteveScalise 2/ “70%”tax on💰made after 10million will never happen (but 40-50 %could).	The argument being that💰would leave the 🇺🇸.But if that💰did leave the 🇺🇸 the need 4 those lobbyists &amp; political donors would also leave.	So in truth losing those 5000&amp; their💰 would actually Ba good thing
@EdKrassen @SteveScalise 1/And in truth at 37% straight tax rate without exceptions anyone who makes more than 5million a year that would be enough to fund the green deal.	The 70% is more of a financial hyperbole that would equal the return of extravagant tax breaks given to the 1% by #GOPPOS.

@ricleal @kthalps And here is the summary pgs27 &amp; 28 re Biden &amp; Bernie and for anyone entering the thread late..,	we are discussing this recent cnn poll		https://t.co/IF9AdhpZWr	The poll was used in an article saying Bernie has strong POC,WOC,women support base...but the poll does not support it https://t.co/k6CQl6rVim
@ricleal @kthalps 1/UR not reading the facts😔	I am sure Ucan understand why I am losing faith in UR dissent since UR not posting pg re Biden &amp; Bernie	I printed them out,so they R easier 2 understand/read. I could see that if UR using a mobile U may not B able 2 scrutinize what UR posting.	but... https://t.co/BwSwW6CGbp
@ricleal @kthalps Still a page showing Drumpf approval and disapproval ratings...	😂 I can’t take you seriously anymore...you aren’t even reading the pdf or scrutinizing what you post.	Here are the pigs Biden and Bernie are on pg 26-29.	He are shots if pg.26&amp;27 https://t.co/qlvIggRB4i
@ricleal @kthalps Did you actually read your own screen shot?!😂	No mention of Biden or Bernie, as I originally stated...only Drumpf.	You are a disappointment.	Please print out and read the pdf.	You may learn something.	Pg.26 &amp;27 https://t.co/YNRAEXvtt9
@ricleal @kthalps 4/I suggest you print out the entire pdf as I did, &amp; read all of it before commenting.	The actually pages that do references Biden &amp; Bernie favor Biden by 16% and do not show specified demographics for WOC or POC...they have “N/A” for those stats.	#haveAGoodDay 🙂
@ricleal @kthalps 3/Orginally I found your deleted commented to be reasonable and worth answering, but then you replaced it with an incorrect statement re pg15 that has nothing to do with Biden or Bernie...it is re Drumpf.	It is too bad. I thought you may have been a person of credible dissent😔
@ricleal @kthalps 2/I agree. I personally find most polls 2B unreliable. I only reference the poll because that is the supportive material being intentionally misrepresented 2validate the opinion of the article that is being cited saying that Bernie has POC,WOC&amp;🚺support.	https://t.co/seV2c9Jicb
@ricleal @kthalps 1/And in reference to your previously deleted tweet in which you stated not to put faith in polls so far ahead of the 2020...I agreed with you and followed with this statement this was saved to drafts(since your original comment was deleted)...
@ricleal @kthalps Pg15 has no mention of Biden or Bernie.	It is approval rating a by demographic for Trump.	Not only did I read all 29 pages...	Including the fact that it is a phone survey sample of 1015 with a mixed demographic...when pg26-28 desk with WOC,POC categories the category reads”N/A”

@byst @keithellison 3/This poll actually is a detriment to the idea of Bernie running. It shows Biden as the strongest candidate by 16% ...which speaks volumes since Bernie has been running for 2020 since he lost in 2016, has been on talk shows and news shows a lot...	and Biden has recently started.
@byst @keithellison 2/It is curious that the CNN poll cited for this article actually shows Biden as the significantly strongest front runner, and had no WOC,POC information in its sample...but is being used to support the idea that Bernie has a strong WOC,POC,woman base?
@byst @keithellison 1/Biden-30% total approval 	Bern-14% total approval	The CNN poll mentioned in this article doesn’t support the claims made by the article...there are no results re WOC,POC both categories are”N/A” in this survey.The CNN poll shows Biden as the significantly strongest front runner
@keithellison Does anyone have a link to the CNN poll referred to in this article...the context &amp; date of it would be helpful.	I was disappointed that I could not find s link to the mentioned CNN poll in the article.	Maybe I missed it?	But I didn’t find a link to the CNN poll mentioned.

I just think there are better candidates like Jerry Brown, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar for top job... the VP and cabinet...we have so many great options!

@sukihd @CandiceRoyer Klobuchar
@CandiceRoyer We need run off elections and voter protections first.	Horse meet cart :)
@CandiceRoyer Agreed.	But I don’t think a Bernie/Beto ticket would ever happen.	And we know Bernie won’t accept a VP from Biden, Klobuchar,Harris.	I do think Bernie would chose one of his previous campaign staff or Osario-Cortez for his VP.
@CandiceRoyer 2/The gun control issue was my original reason for not supporting Bernie.
@CandiceRoyer 1/80% of Bernie’s platform wasn’t adopted.	The platform put forth by Dems was already common ground &amp;was not a“Bernie platform”,it was already a Dem platform. During the debates &amp; on the websites the only real dinstinction between Bernie &amp; HRC was their positions on gun control
@CandiceRoyer I disagree...he openly says he is not s Democrat.	But the reality is	1-he needs the support of the Dem party to win, he can’t win without them.	2-&amp; when he loses the Dem primary he can say he was cheated.	He has already declined VP options so...	🤷🏽‍♀️

@JDmillennial1 @PrettyBadLefty @BravenakBlog 5/&amp; the Gallup poll UR referencing also says 	“Ocasio-Cortez's ratings are mixed, and half of Americans don't know her”... name recognition being the primary driver of the failed survey.	So support Bernie,I am good with it...but don’t push misinformation, it devalues UR position.
@JDmillennial1 @PrettyBadLefty @BravenakBlog 4/The Gallup poll had to do w/name recognition,was compared to Trump &amp; HRC and was also before the Kavanaugh hearings.&amp;though Gallup polls have the most name recognition,they R also deemed the most unreliable...while the TIPP is proven 2B the most accurate.	#justSayin
