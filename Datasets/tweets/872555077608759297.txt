@bill_7841 @mitchellvii It hurts hearing negatives about my favorite President Trump. BIG TIME! I don't want to start an argument with my 96 yr old mom.
@bill_7841 @mitchellvii Not the same topic over and over again. Each hour is a repeat of subject. No wonder they are so low in the polls.
@mitchellvii @bill_7841 It's true! Our visits are difficult. You can only imagine the anger on this old women's face when she talks about evil Trump
@mitchellvii @bill_7841 Where does such HATE come from? My 96year old mother lives to hate President Trump. I hate talking to her. She makes me watch CNN. YIKES!
@Farberyanki All plane crashes are terrible
@brianstelter @LEBassett @AOC Alexandria, tries too hard to be interesting and intellectual. She is neither. I wish she was Alexandria from the Bronx.

@SBJDFW She is a very important person. She is as important as a President. She is RBG! People will want to mourn! They shouldn't keep her a secret!
@RealMattCouch WHY ARE PEOPLE SO FILLED WITH HATE
@Mommafrogg @netanyahu @jairbolsonaro Thanks for your support of Israel, much appreciated.
@AOC Alexandria, you don't know what you are talking about, AGAIN! 	             PLEASE BE ADVISED!
@mitchellvii @BreitbartNews President Trump is doing the best job he can. Pelosi would not compromise. Now, he has more control. Give Trump a chance.
@SBJDFW In the Jewish religion, the person has to be buried within 3 days of dying. Could they have buried her in secret?
@birdman8272 @RealMattCouch @FoxNews RBG HAS GOT TO BE ON HER WAY OUT. NOT DEAD YET! JEWISH PEOPLE REQUIRE TO BE BURIED IN 3 DAYS.	HOPE SHE IS COMFORTABLE!
@kwilli1046 CUTEST
@RepMattGaetz .
@itsTravisW @RealMattCouch @xbrooklynite21 No. She is Jewish. She has to be buried within 3 days of death. It would be headlines.
