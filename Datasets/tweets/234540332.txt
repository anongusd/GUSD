Yes, even in Virginia, it was a Republican wave http://t.co/xUxi9dH5c2
Obama spoke for Anthony Brown in PG Co MD and Mary Burke in Milwaukee. Many in the audience walked out. Both candidates lost. Interesting.
Fox projects Gardner in CO. Meaningful win.
With 90% in Cory Gardner leads Mark Udal 48%-46% in Jefferson Co, west of Denver. In 2010 Repub lost it 48%-46%.
In GA, Nunn may gain over 2008 in metro Atlanta southern counties with increasing black percentages. But Perdue seems headed to 50%+.
Looking at the GA county returns, it looks like Perdue is running ahead of Repub 2008 outside metro Atlanta, plus Cherokee Co there.
100% in Fredericksburg VA, at edge of NoVa metro, 58%-39% Warner. Kaine won it 2012 64%-35%. Gillespie running ahead of other Rs in NoVa.
Looks like Perdue running ahead of Chambliss 2008, and Libertarian with 1.6% in count: Perdue could win w/o runoff. Only D offset left: KS.
100% in Webster Co GA, tiny in heavily black SW, voted 55%-43% Perdue over Nunn. 2008 was 51%-47% D. Low black turnout. apparently.
Oglethorpe Co GA 100% in: Perdue 66%-32%. Chambliss carried it 58%-38% 2008, got 49.8% statewide so it went to runoff.
Stafford Co VA with 39% in http://t.co/AJsu28oJA6 54%-44%, slightly better for Repub than Allen 2012. Looks close statewide.
@MichaelBarone Correction: Allen won it 58%-42%.
@MichaelBarone Famous LBJ 1960 campaign speech on train through VA: "What did Richard Nixon ever do for Culpeper?"
Culpeper Co VA 100% in 64%-33% Gillespie over Warner. Allen 2012 won it 57%-41%, lost state 47%-51%. Good omen for Gillespie.
In early GA returns Demo Jason Carter running a bit better than Demo Michelle Nunn, though polls showed her stronger. Curious.
Scott Brown leading Jeanne Shaheen 3-2 in NH. 3 votes to 2 votes. http://t.co/Bx2KG6E9xJ
Fox projects McConnell in KY and VA Sen too close to call. Good signs for Repubs. Demo gains possible only in GA.
Early returns show McConnell trailing in Fayette (Lex) and leading in Jefferson (Lou). Probably not meaningful: a few precincts.
Republican Eddie Calvo re-elected governor of Guam with 64% http://t.co/laxy5vY0J2 A trend?
@freddoso That's devastating for a Democrat. Democrats usually lead on this.
@PatrickRuffini Source of results?
Fox News shows exit poll NH Sen Brown 50-Shaheen 49. If accurate--a big if--could be a big night for Repubs. Some NH polls still open.

Eric Woolson, top staffer for caucus winners Bush 00 & Huckabee 08, now for TPaw, says relatively few of his people came in on buses.
Perry surprise? Roger Hughes of Hamilton Co, Reagan 76, voted Perry. "Best presidential speech I've heard" this year.
A wired IA Repub operative and straw poll veteran predicts Bachmann no1, Paul no2, TPaw no3. Noted high turnout, much bigger than 07.
Paul crowd at food tent very big. Paul people voting mostly at Scheman Bldg, far away from TPaw greenshirts
Rousing Santorum speech to Strong America Now. Tells me 3 Iowans said they switched from Paul to him bec of debate interchange on Iran.
Woman from Maxwell IA, bet DM & Ames: I saw Perry announce, will vote for him. I love Pawlenty, but Pery seems more presidential.
Voices of Conservative Women tent across from voting lines. Group backs econ cons women, no comment onsocial issues. Big wins in MN 10 leg
Long food line at Santorum non-AC tent
Travis Bryan, cand in TX36 (Pasadena) drove 36 hrs for Santorum, "not afraid to stand on principle."
Santorum coalitions die Jamie Johnson says under radar move to Rick, like Huck 07, 3d possible. Bach not ready, Paul too nutty
Bachmann tent has AC, country music, lots of people milling outside.
Herman Cain serving pizza. Godfather's?
Ex IA Repub Chmn Steve Grubbs says Bachmann has 4 colors for Tshirts. Confusing. But he spots lots of Michele peple
AARP booth has Re again poste--get your picture taken next tot him!
TPaw org chose same trailer site as Huckabee 07; Sarah Huck said it's cheaper and ppl in line are in the shade--line from W gets morning sun
Paul folk have red Tshirts too, but not too many. Under the radar?
TPaw green Tshirts dominant in east line to Hilton voting entrance. Clearly well organized. Many fewer red (& some blue) Bachmann Tshirts
Bachmann crowd outside DMReg Soapbox twice as large as TPaw's, but she's late and speaks only 2 1/2 minutes. With her usual upbeat affect.
Tentative straw poll predicts: low turnout helps Paul, medium turnout (maybe) TPaw, high turnout Bachmann. High=23k1999, low=&lt;4k 2007.
Alas, missed Palin outside Cattle Building. Odd choice of venue? Then she heads to private meeting. Also odd.
Newt at State Fair talks history again, cites Reagan signing gasohol bills 80s. Concludes he'll be a citizen this summer. Low bar for Ames?
Rick Santorum at State Fair: fervent on his reform career and beating incumbent Demos in 90s. Says national press ignores him. That's true
Herman Cain at State Fair cites his recovery from cancer. Inspiring, but relevant? But he's hugely likeable, unlike the repellent Alan Keyes
TPaw draws big and pretty enthusiastic crowd at State Fair. Manager Nick Ayres said no attempt to build crowd, predicts "movement tomorrow"
Ron Paul gets good crowd at State Fair, stops short of capital punishment for the Fed. Many puzzled by his denunciation of "1971"
McCotter at State Fair impressive re recapitalization of banks. I was wrong to say whimsical candidate; he's serious.
