@fredlemire @passion8turk @bobcabarcas and that should make it alright to vote for someone you don't support? its an election not horserace
RT @BtwnUnemploymnt: RT if you're considering voting for #GaryJohnson if you can't write in #RonPaul.
@fredlemire @passion8turk @bobcabarcas removing loopholes doesn't address lobbyists fair tax removes them from getting tax breaks period
@fredlemire @passion8turk @bobcabarcas it's not about splitting votes it's about voting for the best candidate, Is that Romney?
@fredlemire @passion8turk @bobcabarcas if more would have voted Nader he would have been president
@emiliosaidso  Main stream News are not covering at all so most people don't know who he is so if you agree with him throw his name out
@emiliosaidso also Johnson has sued them and it is currently in court, he's trying to get into remaining debates
@emiliosaidso there was a large online protest with emails and such caused 3 cpd sponsors to withdraw their money.
@fredlemire @passion8turk @bobcabarcas http://t.co/OjoLaqdr I think is the site that discusses it
@fredlemire @passion8turk @bobcabarcas Which is what Gary Johnson proposes not Mitt Romney
@emiliosaidso Commission on Presidential debate will not let him participate

@passion8turk @fredlemire @bobcabarcas I don't agree with them all but I respect someone who stands behind his views
@passion8turk @fredlemire @bobcabarcas where as Johnson stance remains the same on the issues
@passion8turk @fredlemire @bobcabarcas I also have issue with his credibility If I spun as many stories as him to my gf she'd  left yrs ago
@passion8turk @fredlemire @bobcabarcas I think Johnson record in that area is better than Romney's as well
@passion8turk @fredlemire @bobcabarcas unfortunately at the end of the day you have to convince people, not tell them what to do
@passion8turk @fredlemire @bobcabarcas If government where able to be run like a business we would have more businessmen than lawyers in it
@passion8turk @fredlemire @bobcabarcas where as A fair tax system seems more likely to generate revenue through growth
@passion8turk @fredlemire @bobcabarcas and additional taxing on companies dampens growth
@passion8turk @fredlemire @bobcabarcas I get generating revenue and cutting spending but the changes he made raised tuition for students
@fredlemire @passion8turk @bobcabarcas I don't doubt he knows that but his experience for doing it seems lacking to me
@fredlemire @passion8turk @bobcabarcas BTW I appplaud each of you for not just going with Romney is better than Obama so PLLLLLL..argument
@fredlemire @passion8turk @bobcabarcas how much people look up to our systems of government in countries that are just now adopting it
@fredlemire @passion8turk @bobcabarcas to reduce our freedoms to frivolous bi partisan nonsense is offensive after seeing firsthand
@fredlemire @passion8turk @bobcabarcas of that time part of which in Bosnia, and Iraq during their elections.
@fredlemire @passion8turk @bobcabarcas I spent 11 years in The US Army defending our rights I don't accept that a vote is wasted
@fredlemire @passion8turk @bobcabarcas I don't want to see Obama in a second term but I won't vote for someone whose ideals don't match mine
@passion8turk @fredlemire @bobcabarcas working with people who all agree not same as a government who doesn't c i2i
@passion8turk @fredlemire @bobcabarcas raised taxes and raised taxes and still failed to stop the deficit from building the following 3 yrs
@passion8turk @fredlemire @bobcabarcas first year in office received unexpected federal grants which accounted for debt reduction that year
@passion8turk @fredlemire @bobcabarcas he had a 35% approval rating when he left office 48th country wide
@passion8turk @fredlemire @bobcabarcas also he proved what he could do as governor more efficiently than Romney
@passion8turk @fredlemire @bobcabarcas oh and I'm voting for Gary Johnson not Ron Paul
@passion8turk @fredlemire @bobcabarcas the 70% that is feasible wont get fixed by ignoring it
@passion8turk @fredlemire @bobcabarcas I'll give him credit as to the Olympics but that was more business and not government
@passion8turk @fredlemire @bobcabarcas apparently the people disagree his approval record was dismal at best
@passion8turk @fredlemire @bobcabarcas how can you stop a flood by adding more water to it, you can't keep spending and shrink deficit
@passion8turk @fredlemire @bobcabarcas http://t.co/3TLlbPBO now compare it to Gary Johnson
@passion8turk @fredlemire @bobcabarcas if you can't handle government at the state level why believe he can at federal level?
@passion8turk @fredlemire @bobcabarcas what has Mitt done to warrant my support? From what I can see he failed as a governor
Ron Paul on the debates: 'Don't expect tremendous differences' http://t.co/7f9tDZpY via @examinercom
