Tracy &amp; I are working to get #Tennessee OFF an @outsidemagazine list. The #NatchezTraceParkway is one of the nation’s deadliest parks: 32 suicide deaths at our bridge since 2000. We must do better @NatlParkService #SuicidePrevention https://t.co/zRhrekj6sD https://t.co/m2SwJSt6xu
@JoyintheSmokys @TheNaomiJudd There are signs (not written by Naomi, though) and phones to call the Suicide Prevention Hotline. But low barrier enables too-quick action. A higher barrier would ensure more time to think.
I'm a fan of @outsidemagazine. But here in #Tennessee we are working hard to get OFF one of your lists. We need help from the @NatlParkService to do it. #SuicidePrevention #SaveLives https://t.co/yMiIt2NBD4 https://t.co/14s1TPEnFE
Heard from @RepMarkGreen last night. Thank you for coming alongside life-saving work started by @Centerstone @raisethebarntb &amp; @TSPNorg The heart behind this work may be in Middle TN, but it can only be solved at the federal level @NatlParkService   https://t.co/S7vlXubDTh
So grateful to @raisethebarntb @Centerstone @TSPNorg for their efforts to save lives at the #NatchezTraceBridge. Studies have shown that curbing access to impulsive and lethal means of suicide is a successful method of prevention. https://t.co/wb4ghuiXaE https://t.co/LmN340osCE

Day 93 of my service call. @ATTCares came to start @Uverse installation on September 3. Still no internet. Can anyone beat that?
Still struggling with @ATTCares and @Uverse. Appreciate this explanation! https://t.co/7PAa6UjFqx
@DNorrell Happy to settle for regular guy able to order some Christmas presents online.
Had @Uverse techs out since Sept. Nice folks, but still no internet. Latest promised we'd be done by Dec 2. Yet still no progress...
@DNorrell a bit rural and not a lot of other options, unfortunately. Thanks though.
@DNorrell Have other suggestions?
Sept 3 @ATTCares notice to upgrade DSL to @Uverse. Agreed. Tech came 9/3. No progress... Nov 30 DSL disconnected though still no @Uverse
Still no internet @ATTcares. Was pleased when you first said we'd be switched to @Uverse, but I thought @Uverse would work.

Ebola safety measures: knew in theory. But the shift when you step over the line resembles nothing more than panic. #EbolaFrontlines
All other healthcare shut down in Sierra Leone. So Ebola Treatment Units were the only healthcare available #EbolaFrontlines
2 goals of ETU: quarantine &amp; care. Care often lags behind. I hope that changes b/c there is no substitute for bedside care. #EbolaFrontlines
