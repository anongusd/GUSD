RT @MALDEF: .@MALDEF pres. Thomas Saenz discussed racial gerrymandering at @HarvardAsh Center. Watch the panel discussion: https://t.co/x6f…
.@ArturoNALEO The Commerce Secretary did something extraordinary. He actually requested more money for something that was not the military. The census. #fairMaps
.@ArturoNALEO: The Census Bureau has been starved for resources in the run-up to the 2020 census. #fairMaps
@NALEO @ArturoNALEO
People have never been accurately counted, says Arturo Vargas @NALEO. Especially, poor and minorities. #FairMaps
.@uscensusbureau since 2012 has been underfunded by $200 million, says John Thompson, former Census Director. https://t.co/bllGKerMbw
RT @Kennedy_School: Partisan #gerrymandering is a problem across the US. Are #fairmaps possible? Today's conference explores https://t.co/P…
RT @ruthgreenwood: Re-upping this bc I just mentioned here at @HarvardAsh #FairMaps #bothsidesgerrymander https://t.co/YORAqoyDxF
Why is there increased engagement around the issue of #gerrymandering? Cathy Duvall says lack of accountability and extreme partisanship are helping to spur frustration and interest. #FairMaps
.@mcpli: CA sets the bar for transparency for independent redistricting commissions. Maybe they could make a miniseries of the commission's testimony. #fairmaps
@mcpli California also has a lot of #transparency. That gives more room for people to feel involved in the process. #FairMaps
A commission where you see a lot of satisfaction is California’s. Why? They have independent selection process and a large (14 member) commission, says @mcpli #FairMaps
Reform is coming from legislatures around the country, says @NCSLorg’s Wendy Underhill. #FairMaps https://t.co/ixKnOlwMC4
RT @mcpli: Kelly Ward of @DemRedistrict: “The next redistricting cycle will be the first cycle in the history of ever that will be truly de…
.@kellycward: We shouldn't just assume that commissions are the answer. Some states do it just fine with elected officials drawing maps. #fairmaps
.@jankowskigop "I'm for fairer districts. I'm for reform. I'm for better guardrails in place, but I don't think they should be taken out of the hands of elected officials."  #fairmaps
RT @HaroutManougian: "Until 2011, the big impetus behind gerrymandering was incumbency protection" instead of partisan advantage -@kellycwa…
.@jankowskigop "you can't say 2016 voters who voted for HRC and a GOP member of Congress in same election are disenfranchised." #fairMaps
.@kellycward: we are not trying to gerrymander for Democrats. We don't want to break the system for us. #fairMaps
Will we see you tomorrow? Join us &amp; @ProfVarshney at 4:15 to discuss India's #democracy https://t.co/fdUYewm5mT https://t.co/hGJdEhhaRK
.@kellycward: It shouldn't take tsunami like elections in VA to essentially tie the House of Delegates. #fairMaps
.@kellycward on whether VA Dems should gerrymander 2020 maps if they end up controlling General Assembly: No #fairMaps
.@jankowskigop: Senate is getting more polarized and we haven't redistricted that yet. #fairMaps
.@jankowskigop "last night a lot of voters got re-enfranchised."#fairmaps
.@jankowskigop on impact of redistricting in VA: we had a supermajority in one house even though HRC carried state by 5%. When you overreach for the cookie jar, sometimes the cookie jar comes down on you.
.@kellycward "We own that redistricting is a political process." #fairMaps
.@kellycward: reflecting on 2010, Dems didn't have eye on the ball redistricting given their full control of WH &amp; Congress. #fairMaps
.@jankowskigop argues that 2010 downballot impact on redistricting greatly exaggerated. #fairmaps
After last census, Texas gained 4 congressional seats. Despite large Latino population, there was no Latino majority district drawn, says Thomas Saenz @MALDEF #FairMaps https://t.co/LuVNLL50Vi
It’s taking way to long to get conflicts over redistricting settled via courts, says @_justinlevitt_ #fairmaps
Seeking political power via racial #gerrymandering is not okay, says @_justinlevitt_ #Fairmaps https://t.co/t2mQP1347I
Asian Americans are looking more towards minority coalition districts, says Terry Ao Minnis @AAAJ_AAJC @aaaj_alc #fairmaps
Asian Americans are beginning to transition growth in population &amp; voter #s to political power, says Terry Ao Minnis @aaaj_alc #Fairmaps
History of #gerrymandering makes it clear that the impulse to gerrymander for partisan gains will not go away, says Alex Keyssar #Fairmaps
#Gerrymandering as an issue really took off after the civil war, says @Kennedy_School historian Alex Keyssar #Fairmaps https://t.co/xdmjT4XNnX
