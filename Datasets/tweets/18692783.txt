Charter/Spectrum is going to force us to move to DTC, a place I explicitly said I never wanted to live when I was forced to move out to this fucking state. I am seriously considering leaving my husband here and going back east. Fucking hate this place.

@mikeofmany I have to have drink already in my mouth before I pop any pills. Promethazine is particularly nasty because it quick dissolves.
Oh for fucks sake... Do no exfoliate (or douche) your vagina, ladies. It is a self-cleaning part of your body. You will disrupt the microbiome of wonderfulness, and then get weird vag smell. Keto diets also cause the smell. You're welcome. #VaginaPSA https://t.co/XSnrsybung
So how is your Friday going? I just ran all the errands I need for the next couple of days, because it's going to snow its ass off. Plus, I'm pretty sure my uterus is trying to escape by stabbing its way out. https://t.co/7UzAjaS1z5
@Pornhub Alexa, order 1000  cans of creamed corn and an industrial sized drum of lube.
@Shatter242 @VictorOps That's why I appreciated the swift response. Usually, I get strung along for a week or two hoping I got a job. At least I don't have to hang on to false hope this time.
I love being rejected first thing in the morning @VictorOps :( At least you were quick to reject me, and didn't string me along. I appreciate that.

@TaliaBuford 1. I think natural hair is beautiful (and I've been secretly jealous since kindergarten) 2. With that said, your new doo is pretty awesome! I could never EVER have curls that stayed like that in my hair (lawd, we've tried).
@25_JOKER_KING I like when a guy is himself. If they're not comfortable enough to show their emotions, they're probably not comfortable enough to effective communicate with a partner.

@steveken Ehhhh I only trust professionals with bleach patterns. He is not artistic... like, at all. He does dye my hair for me when I need to fill it in, though.
I really need a good colorist near me. Last place I went to charged me $170 for a not-all-the-way-done job, tried to get me to come back and charge me more. Y'all know how I love to rock bold colors tastefully.
It would be so nice to work again. Work gives me purpose. When I don't work, the depression rears its ugly head. Conditioned over my lifetime to equate work with self-worth. Yeah, I know it's stupid... I'm that weird Oregon Trail/Xennial generation.
Have an interview with Splunk on Thursday. I really REALLY hope this is a gig that works out. Good friend of mine works for them, and says so many wonderful things about working there.
Just when a wave of depression washes over me at breakfast, "Don't worry, be happy" comes on. Then I remember Robin Williams silently suffered and didn't speak out... so I am so I don't end up dead.
Someone from Reddit is going to send me a bigass fiber bundle so I can make it into wall art. Now I need some LED's and the right frame, and it'll be awesome :D

@Marshall9News @KamalaHarris @realDonaldTrump PS: I have lots of friends who worked on The Hill, and was told about her behavior years ago. I'm glad it's getting press.

@punkeel @outforundergrad So, I have this fun combo of a.d.d. and sensory processing disorder where I learn things by solving problems. I tend not to retain info if I'm not working toward a resolution? How to sell "I can fix anything given enough time"?
@punkeel @outforundergrad I am not good enough for a lot of what I find. I have many things I can do, but they don't translate well on paper?
@jgrahamc @punkeel I would be so down with that. I LOVE listening to space sounds!!!! But you had to admit, having Cloudflare in space would be pretty badass :)
ARRRRRGH! @Glassdoor keeps sending me jobs that I've been declined for. It's really annoying AND sad. A daily reminder that I suck enough to not get those jobs. Really bad for morale, @Glassdoor.
@punkeel @jgrahamc Don't mind me, @jgrahamc I have no idea what I'm doing either. Just good at organizing the chaos :P
@punkeel New entropy generator idea: cubesats taking pics of a chunk of the galaxy!
@punkeel I applied to work at target out of desperation. I've been unemployed since the end of August. Partially because lay-offs trigger bad depression, partially because I suck at job hunting.
@punkeel @outforundergrad My issue is my resume apparently sucks, I don't have a degree (which at my age, shouldn't matter in IT), and I'm bad at selling myself. I actually gave a talk at that Google location a few years ago :)
@punkeel Spirited Away was and still is my fave, followed by Nausicaa, Castle in the Sky. Princess Kagura is pretty amazing too. Had a cat named Chihiro :) https://t.co/QCKB7hZsQD
Do you think drug companies come up with names for drugs by picking random consonants and vowels out of hats? Kinda feels like they do...
Andrew McCabe is quickly becoming a familiar face across the major news outlets. Someone needs to help him get a Twitter account. I keep trying to tweet words of encouragement, only to see he has no twitter account!
@punkeel I did! I was following the saga of the stupid copyright nonsense, which kept it from being released in the US for a bit. I watched it in Japanese with subs before it came here. Good stuff!!! Have you seen The Wind Rises?
@punkeel @outforundergrad I'm looking for anything that would let me use my skills. They're varied and odd. Sign that I can learn anything? :) Boulder/Denver is my area. Colorado is HUUUUUGE!!!! I was cut before OVH :x
@punkeel @StudioGhibli You should also be less-concerned by metal boxes because I literally walked away from that accident! I was picking glass out of my skull for a minute, and lost a job because of it, though.
@punkeel https://t.co/sMcIAIpzEq
@punkeel @StudioGhibli @outforundergrad I would if I still worked for a company that participates. @VMware laid me off as part of the doomed vCloud Air stuff. Unemployed right now, definitely looking though!
@punkeel @StudioGhibli I've been run over by them TWICE. Fun area I grew up in where a bunch of major arteries intersect to get people to NYC. Lots of trucks (lots of truckstops with cool stories to hear from truckers!), and lost out of towners.

@jogebauer It would be easier if they'd let you report tweets where you suspect bots or state-sponsored actors fucking with things. They're usually pretty easy to spot if you know what to look for. Just like on Reddit.
@punkeel @StudioGhibli It was during the ebola scare, too! I came home and went to urgent care, and they sealed off the room I was in and everything just to be certain it WASN'T ebola :P https://t.co/EiX0CxkHq6
@punkeel I like staring at things that aren't screens. So, whatever is causing the randomness is fun to me :) Haven't been to SF since mentoring kids at Twitter's HQ. Caught some sort of plague while there :x

@NerdPyle I have a super weird mix of skills that would be great for any company. Nobody will hire me, though. I'm looking for work, OR resume help!!

@ColinVanGogh I was reading at a college level in 3rd grade. So, they took me out of English classes and put me in the gifted language arts class. Good stuff. Great teacher who challenged us. Probably why I'm such an effective communicator. Still can't look people in the eye though. #autism
@ColinVanGogh Music helped me cope. I've learned all the string instruments, and a bunch of percussion. Also taught me a new way to learn, as I was doing poorly in traditional classes. Music is important. Now I solve impossible to fix problems. #autism
If you're autistic, that's alright. I am too. It just took 32 years to figure it out. Because I'm a girl, I went misdiagnosed for most of my life. I wish I'd been diagnosed sooner. Things would be much different, and less stressful. #autism

@KarlBode Sounds like driving around here in the snow with the Texans and Californians who have never seen snow before... CDOT also likes to wait until snow is done to plow. But you can track them live, which is neat!
@chej I wish they'd figure out how to fix the Chambers Works site. It's already been "cleaned up" under Superfund and FUSRAP programs, and it's still the worst chemical disaster area on the planet.
@Marshall9News How useful...
@HoarseWisperer @citizengatsby It's filled with that sewer blockage known as @AjitPaiFCC
@KarlBode C'mon, they're not getting THAT much snow. I like that the snow here is so light/fluffy I can literally blow it away with a leaf blower, or a broom.
I need to know why there is no report option for tweets that allow you to report accounts/tweets as state-sponsored actors. @TwitterSupport
@ZerlinaMaxwell @citizengatsby It pissed me off so much I tweeted about it as it happened. That is something I identify with, as I am constantly talked over as a woman. Then, a russian bot tried telling me to shut up and sit down.
Hey guys, look at this stupid bot account! HEY @TwitterSupport DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. https://t.co/FFXzfmTcca
@caringi_sue You're also being reported for being a bot. Way to go!
@caringi_sue Fuck off, honeybuns.
HEY THERE'S MY MAN @RepJoeNeguse! Asking important questions about cannabis that NOBODY else is bringing up. #WhitakerHearing
DON'T FUCK WITH PHILLY. Ms. Scanlon is not playing your games. Philly doesn't fuck around. @RepMGS #WhitakerHearing
I am convinced this dude does not know how to answer a yes or no question. Like, it looks like it physically pains him to be asked yes or no... #WhitakerHearing
Old white dude is cutting off the black lady trying to speak at the #WhitakerHearing. How fitting, as this is an example of how women of ALL colors are constantly cut off by men while trying to speak.
@RobQuigley @js_edit It could have been US agency, or foreign. They were not forthcoming with details beyond government agency. Fun thing is, American Media Inc is violating terms of their bargain with prosecutors by doing this shit.
@jtl999 @washingtonpost They believe a government agency grabbed Bezos' data
@MeghanMcCain Girl, I LOVE your blazer on Colbert tonight. Who is it by? PS: Your father was the last of a great generation of politicians and American heroes. I'm pretty blue, but I have always respected your father.
@notcapnamerica Maybe they're finally going to test him for dementia...
Em, @digitaliworld you need to fix your very bad reporting. https://t.co/C0zJu5xWRl
@philritz1 also jealous you're in manhattan because my faaaaavorite indian place is there in a hole in the wall place in the village.
@philritz1 Have you heard of Chambers Works? Besides my tweet to the Senator. I grew up next to it. All sorts of rare disease clusters I'm uncovering. We have a group of people finally talking about it, and it's pretty horrific stuff.
Positive things: I got to see my favorite kiddo on the whole planet! We cooked together, watched Sailor Moon, and took pictures with her new camera. So happy this little girl lived with me for a year, because she is the light of my life &lt;3 We're building robots next week!
@philritz1 hey there, i think you and i are going to become very good friends.
Dude writing the Bezos story @washingtonpost just said Bezos security team said he wasn't hacked... and a state-sponsored attack on his info likely happened. That is HUGE news.
https://t.co/6ynT4ovDIa
@KyleClark There's a site you can report meteor or whatever in the sky stuff to... I just forget what it is right now.
@SenMarkey I noticed you're on the environmental committee. I am from Southern NJ, home of the worst chemical disaster area in the US. We need help. Dupont spun off Chemours to keep liability away from DOW merger. Left us all dying or very sick.
@Marshall9News railroad rules are stringent. I grew up with Amtrak and read the "black bible" with all the railroad rules in it for fun as a kid. Like how to read rail signals and stuff. Look for W for whistle locations.

Also, pay attention to @SpeakerPelosi behind the cheeto. She's not standing, she's going through paperwork, and giving him faces. He does not deserve her time. #SOTU
What alternative universe is this cheeto living in? Where is he pulling these numbers from?? #SOTU
Oh man, Buzz Aldrin's face is all of us being forced to clap for the cheeto talking about American rockets. Cheeto  doesn't even like Bezos OR Musk. #SOTU
Trump's spray tan is on point for this special #SOTU at least he got something right? Silver lining?

You know... if you don't want to hire me, just tell me so. Stop stringing me along giving me false hope. It triggers the suicide part of my brain making me think I'm useless and unemployable. I've been unemployed since the end of August. Can't pay rent on time again.
The original Dr. Dolittle is on @tcm right now! I loved this book as a child. This version of the movie is my favorite! I should get kiddo a copy of the book...
@fairuse Spectrum legit didn't have a game plan for how to pay off things post-merger. Dumbasses didn't know what they bought, and ruined a world-class network on the TWC side.
@fairuse you can eat on adderall? it kills my appetite to the point where i gag when i see food. lamictal for mood stablizing. limited on what i can take because of rare disease bullshit.
@majornelson Dude, they're backed up with support requests and are getting to stuff from mid-January. I think they need to beef up their support staff... :( I just wanna dig holes man.
Oh, by the way... I applied to Spectrum for an ops position (did this at Comcast before tweeting). Didn't get hired. Why? Hiring freeze. Why freeze? Probably cause they're out of money and have to make payment on merger. Stupid Spectrum. Build shiny building, now has no money.
@fairuse adderall is the only thing that works for me, but i hate taking it. make my heart rate funky, i sweat like a pig, and grind what little teeth i have left into oblivion.
So, new med is working (yay) but it's also making me lose interest in things I love (not ok), so I am conflicted as to its efficacy. At least I left the house today? I think I'll be ok once I find a job.
@chrisvanderveen PS: I used to work for Comcast's office of the president handling the executive complaints. I know that company like the back of my hand. I am a super consumer advocate. I fight for the user.

@WomenTechSummit tech feels hopeless after 15 years in the industry. what can i do to find a job that doesn't put me down because i have tits? thinking about getting out altogether.
@Jayson_Greene No other candidate has run into a burning building to save people before. That makes him stand out, as he is a decent human being at heart... and that means a lot in today's political climate. What don't you like about his politics?
@TwitterU I wish you guys could find something for me :( Wouldn't it be nice to have a shorty award winner as staff?
@Jayson_Greene He also ran into a burning house to save his neighbor. Cory Booker  is a FAR higher caliber of decent human being than that orange shitgibbon we call president.
@mitchellreports @Yamiche Only senator to run into a burning building and save people, too.
@hunterw He literally ran into his neighbor's burning house to save them. Of course his neighbors love him!!
@GOP Spread your BULLSHIT elsewhere. 	-Are you from NJ? No. 	-Do you have any idea how bad Newark was BEFORE he was mayor? No. 	-Source? Your cherry-picking of statistics is bullshit and require a TRUSTWORTHY source. 	-NOBODY trusts anything you lying GOP fucks say.
@KFILE Superman doesn't need a hat or gloves... but he does need a tissue. Someone's got the sniffles during his first press conference announcing his run for president!
Will someone get @CoryBooker a tissue at his first press conference where he's announcing his run for President? He sounds like he snorted too much coke. (We know superman doesn't need coke. It's just COLD outside.) PS: He did great in Newark. It's WAY less of a shit hole now!

@SenatorTomUdall @EPA Thank you! As someone who grew up in the shadow of Dupont Chambers Works, I know how bad the pollution can get. Our water was unusable for cooking for the longest time thanks to barely regulated chemicals by the EPA. NJ DEP was more stringent, saved us all.

MAGA hats are the new white hoods. They stand for racism. They stand for HATE. They are a key indicator of stupidity and blatant cult-following nonsense. America was great before that orange shitgibbon became president.
Everyone is fixated on our cheeto president, while the people of my county suffer from over one hundred years of Dupont's chemical legacy. PEOPLE ARE DYING. Nobody is helping us. Nobody seems to care. WE ARE A PART OF NEW JERSEY. Why are we overlooked? @NJDeptofHealth @njdotcom
@AOC DUPONT, a mega corporation, is the cause of our woes. They have used and abused us for generations. Now, our offspring are suffering. I have piles of stories I could tell you. My town is suing them for a BILLION to clean this shit up. Nobody will help us.
@AOC I need help. Dupont poisoned my county, and everyone's had the wool pulled over their eyes for 100 years. It sounds nuts, but it's true :( EPA, DEP, no help. We are dying from rare shit. I NEED HELP.
@RogueISP It is my personal crusade to report bot accounts :D
.@marsospina Please help us fix the disastrous chemical legacy Dupont left us in Salem County. We are DYING.  Reporters in WV taking notice, while state is leaving us hanging out to dry. WE ARE PART OF NEW JERSEY AND WE REFUSE TO BE FORGOTTEN ANYMORE.
@NJDHS @FirstLadyNJ @GovMurphy Dupont's legacy is killing babies, but nobody is helping us. PFOA's have been linked to pregnancy-induced hypertension. Among other nasty things. We are taking matters into our own hands, and getting the law involved. 100+ years of poisoning our residents is TOO MUCH.
@FirstLadyNJ Tammy, your citizens in Salem County are impacted by environment factors from Dupont. The state is doing nothing to help us fix this. We are turning to the law to get help. PFOA known to cause pregnancy-induced hypertension!!
The plot thickens: It appears that medical professionals have engaged in a cover-up of medical disorders for YEARS in Salem County. Were they bought off by Dupont? How the HELL am I going to prove this? :(

So, I just watched @DevilWeKnowFilm and their problems pale in comparison to what Dupont did to us in Salem County.  C-8 is the least of our concerns. I need all the help I can get.
@jkunau YOU'RE IN DENVER??? I am too... I am a child of Chambers Works, and I'm organizing the towns right now to get help.
@EWGPrez I need your help!!!
@stephsoechtig @Jeremy_Seifert Please contact me about Dupont Chambers Works. We are organizing RIGHT NOW. I have all sorts of awful shit to share with you.

@dvmn_thatsshari @ErinBrockovich I seriously believe this was caused by Dupont, not any family shit. Girl, get your DNA tested if you can.
@kaerick @CovCathColonels You sure about that? I am seeing reports of people identifying the wrong young boy. Please do not spread false information. Everyone standing there is at fault.
HEY RADIO NERDS. Did Collins Radio ever contract out to GM Delco Radio Division to manufacture stuff? The piece of history has a Collins model# but says GM Delco! https://t.co/CdX1cOIQR2

@dvmn_thatsshari @ErinBrockovich Girl, at least SIX PEOPLE in my teeny tiny county have come forth telling me they have Lupus.
@banaifeldstein @TwitterSupport LOL I doubt it! Twitter is great because shit is permanent.
@dvmn_thatsshari @ErinBrockovich For me, it was Dupont Chambers Works. Worst chemical disaster on the planet. Get you AND YOUR PARENTS DNA tested, if you can afford it. I did @23andMe and @promethease for under $200. Saved my life. Discovered more shit about my fam, and they're getting help too!
@dvmn_thatsshari Do you mind if I ask where you're from? We are suspecting environmental factors like hazardous chemicals did it to my home county. Going full @ErinBrockovich on this shit.
Whoaaa new Twitter looks nice! Hey @TwitterSupport GOOD JOB!!!! https://t.co/cmOSp2Ro5w
@dvmn_thatsshari My sister has it. I just discovered a Lupus cluster in my home county. Does it run in your family??
If this were a Muslim youth doing this to a Christian, the country would be up in arms about this incident. Instead, a group of BOYS (they don't deserve to be called men) seem to be getting away with it. How awful. https://t.co/8Zbid9DG7A

@idahohioan Nope. Same floor, three different times! #OhMyMom
@idahohioan Like how? The attic had flooring to a certain point. Mom did not stick to that flooring when getting stuff out of the attic, and thus fell through the floor/ceiling on three separate occasions. Twice in living room, once in the kitchen.
My mom fell through the ceiling not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES. #OhMyMom

Truly, a glorious day, when the cable guys in my FB cable guy group acknowledge I had the only correct solution to an issue plaguing a tech. Normally, my boobs get in the way of answers. #IveStillGotIt #telecommunications #WomenInSTEM
@IlhanMN PREACH!
@AliVelshi That doesn't seem to be the case in Colorado. My friend who is a contractor for USGS is being told the offers are for actual furloughed federal employees :(
@zerogspot @heyjacqui_ No Bone Rot! ROFL
That last tweet ranks up there in awfulness with Tuvix #StarTrek
In my free time, I like to Star Trek shitpost. This one was particularly horrifying, and I couldn't help but post it. Also, my head hurts :/  #StarTrek #FridayFeeling https://t.co/6TutCrHv7K
@AliVelshi Most offers from companies are for furloughed govt workers, NOT contractors, which is seriously screwing over even more people.
Interesting case if you're following this sort of thing. Implications for future legal issues brought about by shit security practices... https://t.co/05KOR8Sw6S
The Environmental Hearing Board, which hears appeals against DEP  actions, said in a ruling on Wednesday that DEP was wrong to treat  sections of the plant as separate entities when assessing their emissions, and should have evaluated the plant as a whole. https://t.co/KVkZ3JOapv
@AdvocateReviews Not seeing a place to just submit a resume?
It's nice to see these offers for federal employees during the shutdown, but what about the contractors who don't count? I feel this isn't getting enough attention. #HeyNext
@CBS4Tim @KyleClark Did you guys see the news about folks aged 65+ posting the most fake news out of any age bracket?
New antidepressant has me dreaming about violent deaths over and over again of people I do and don't know. I'm telling you this, because it's important to let people know that yeah, I suffer from crippling depression and am trying to get help. #EndTheStigma
@CBS4Tim @KyleClark Ask her if she wants a pen pal. I love listening to old folks stories. I fear they may be lost to time if people don't stop their busy lives and listen to their elders. So, yeah, I probably would dig her.
@GonzoTorpedo That would take all of ten seconds to break at a real airport LOL
@KyleClark @CBS4Tim Someone is old and doesn't know how to properly use his paint apps. That's why they work for CBS, the old folks station.

@robini71 unfortunately! he is grossly out of touch with the real world still, it seems.
Yeah so Brian Williams final bit on his stupid show tonight showed how out of touch he is with my generation and the ones that followed. NORMAL PEOPLE USE SOCIAL MEDIA TO POST EVERYTHING FROM THEIR FOOD TO THEIR TEETH CLEANING. Holy crap old people...
@steveken they refunded without letting us know. still getting a lawyer for what they put us through.
As someone who did PR and put spin on things professionally ten years ago, it's very easy for me to see blatant Russian propoganda from the GOP. That letter they sent out to their supporters yesterday looked like something straight out of the cold war. Jebus. #WhiteHouseSitcoms

@CherryAmbition I just relived it very vividly out of nowhere when they accepted the golden globe for the series/movie thing about the incident. I buried that shit deep down. I forgot about it. This stirred it up. It was terrifying.
I apparently have PTSD from the Andrew Cunanan killing in my hometown. He killed Versace, but he killed a close family friend and stole his truck to drive down to Miami to kill Versace. I just had a flashback and it sucked. So scared. So terrified. #GoldenGlobes
Just so you know, ‚ÄòAssassination of Gionni Versace' happened in my hometown. Cunanan killed a close family friend, who was a caretaker at Finns Point Natl Cemetery, stole his truck, then killed Versace. Why our town? I still have nightmares. #GoldenGlobes

@demaderios It's horrifying. I predicted this would happen when he got "elected" based on how people became cruel as SOON as he was "elected". It's like the way people acted post-9/11.

I am so effing excited about getting @CollinsAero this receiver! I'm a bit of a history nut (volunteered with multiple historical societies, worked at a fort...), and this makes my heart so happy to see this getting somewhere it will be appreciated for years to come!
Even better news! I am getting this to their museum one way or another! Verified it's still in the store, having them hold it for me. Need to find someone back home to crate it up. It's 110lbs...
@ElevationsCU thanks a ton!
Please read this entire thread. It's heartbreaking. We can not turn a blind eye to what's going on in Saudi Arabia. https://t.co/EwLtfPbwgv

@charley_ck14 ROFL yeah I guess it is hahahahaha
@charley_ck14 I drank champagne out of the bottle once, and it came out my nose. Now I know to sip it lol
So, @CollinsAero DM'd me back. Hopefully I can get this piece of history back to them for preserving!
@TheEllenShow @KevinHart4real I can't wait!
@ElevationsCU are you guys hiring tech people at the new building you're building in Interlocken? I need a job, badly.
@UTC I found a piece of Collins history from the 50's in pristine condition. Trying to get it to corporate for history's sake.

Oh snap, @CollinsAero still exists! I just tweeted them to see if they want to save this amazing piece of communications history!! #HistoryMatters #communications #military

@robini71 Husband first said him and psych think I should see someone else... THEN said they tried calling me to setup an appointment, cant find any missed calls or voicemails. I had concerns this would happen when my doctor recommended I see this psych.
@robini71 I was given two different reasons for the WHY which conflicted each other. Definitely don't want to go to a practice with a communication breakdown before I have an appointment.
@robini71 Yeah, sometimes depression makes no sense, lady.
Need to get out of this stupid loop of thinking that I'm a burden to those around me. It leads to worse thoughts.

I am still giggling at the thought of a million people in Times Square on New Years Eve seeing my @DoorDash debacle unfold on the big screen. It shouldn't take that amount of effort to get a refund lol. @KyleClark #HeyNext
It'd be a better day if I didn't have to drive somewhere for food at 11pm last night. That's ok, though, because a million people saw your fuckup in Times Square last night. Karma's getting you guys. This isn't the first time you've screwed up this badly. https://t.co/BsDEFO42eW

So, @DoorDash only got back to me AFTER my tweet hit Times Square on #NewYearsEve2018 which just goes to show they don't really give a shit until you become a big enough pain in the ass to force them to do something. Refund incoming, that's about it. #NewYears2019 #HappyNewYear
@ProChargedLS2 @DoorDash @DoorDash_Help Yeap. The amount of karma being doled out here is pretty epic.

Hey guys, I made the Times Square feed on New Years Eve LOL. @DoorDash just got a million people in Times Square to see how badly they fucked up!! @DoorDash_Help #NewYearsEve2018 #NewYears2019 https://t.co/47TG0duzTR
@PozLang I DID BUT IT WAS AN HOUR LATE AND COLD AND INEDIBLE AND DOORDASH HASNT REFUNDED MY MONEY AND HUNG UP ON ME AFTER AN HOUR ON HOLD. Holy shit. I'm HANGRY GIRL!!!!!
Proof of the fuckery: Note the time in the upper right corner (sorry it's military time) and the time @DoorDash says the order should be delivered, the status of the order, and then the time when the order was actually delivered. @DoorDash_Help #NewYearsEve2018 #NewYears2019 https://t.co/E0gfKADpvd
HAHAHA THE GUY JUST DELIVERED OUR FOOD AN HOUR LATE. It's cold. Completely inedible, not safe to eat. Are you trying to give me food poisoning @DoorDash @DoorDash_Help #NewYearsEve2018 #NewYears2019
Still on hold. Dude doesn't seem to understand I want my food, plus a refund. I don't think that's asking too much. He offered a $10 credit, which is a blatant attempt to get me off the phone. I'm HANGRY now. @DoorDash @DoorDash_Help #NewYearsEve2018 #NewYears2019
@TheEllenShow GOOD ENOUGH! LOL! Happy New Year, lady. May the new year bring your rescue efforts alllllll of the donations!
This is how long I've been on the phone with @DoorDash @DoorDash_Help with no help and no food... https://t.co/PSEnVZgLYZ
OH lawwwwd they were going to try and make the guy deliver our food, which is 40 minutes old now... food poisoning much? Only offering to cancel order, not even redo it. Waiting for a manager now. @DoorDash @DoorDash_Help #NewYearsEve2018 #NewYears2019
OMG I called the restaurant, they said our food was picked up a half hour ago by @DoorDash but we still have no food... and I can't cancel the order either, and nobody is picking up at their call center @DoorDash_Help #NewYearsEve2018 #NewYears2019 #doordash
@SwiftOnSecurity @zololski oh jesus fuck... that poor girl is going to die with some of that glitter still on her lol
Well, food was supposed to be here 20 minutes ago. Still showing not even picked up from restaurant. On forever hold on the phone with @DoorDash @DoorDash_Help NO HELP AT ALL YET :( :( Wow.  #NewYearsEve2018 #NewYears2019 #doordash
FYI if you ever need to call @DoorDash they don't actually have a phone number anywhere for you to call. So, here it is 855-973-1040 and then you'll sit on hold for a long time, and maybe get help. @DoorDash_Help #CustomerServiceFail
Hey @DoorDash are we gonna get our food? The dude isn't at the restaurant yet, and it's 11 minutes after the time the food was supposed to be delivered to us. No way to contact you to fix? @DoorDash_Help #NewYearsEve2018 #NewYears2019
I am kind of surprised at the number of customer service fails I've experienced in the last week. It makes me sad that good customer service is no longer a valued thing (except for the good ones, you know who you are).
So, my @DoorDash order was supposed to be here 8:19. It is now 8:22 and dude isn't even at the restaurant yet. Our food is going to be cold. What are you gonna do @DoorDash_Help ? #NewYearsEve2018 #NewYears2019
@KyleClark I am grateful for the wonderful State of Colorado and the melting pot it's become! I am thankful for journalists like you, who are making sure the truth is known!

@brightbus right???
Holy shit guys. This rental car bullshit is getting out of hand. They're blatantly lying to me in DM's now. Time to lawyer up!
Yep. Budget/Avis just lost million dollar contracts over less than $500 that won't get refunded back to us. They were out of cars anyway, even if they had decided to get us our rental.
Going home tomorrow. Still nada from @budget @avis what an epic customer service fail. They've already lost a million dollar contract over their shit service. Way to go, guys. I'll make sure you lose even more business over this.

@NBCPhiladelphia @NBCInvestigates Please see my tweets about @Avis @Budget leaving us stranded at PHL airport Christmas Eve/Morning and still doing NOTHING about it. This is absurd. PR nightmare for them. We PREPAID for our car, too. #FridayThoughts
@PatchouliW @steveken @Avis @budget is now involved and not doing a whole hell of a lot except pointing fingers at each other...
Just to let you know, @Avis @Budget left us stranded with no humans to help us 1am Christmas morning at Philly airport. Won't help us out. We're stranded in NJ with no car now. Almost killed me because I was VERY ILL. Nothing is being done. #FridayFeeling #FridayMotivation
So, I'm still stranded in NJ with no rental car. @Avis took two DAYS to respond, did nothing. @Budget who owns @Avis said they'd fix this for us, and nothing has materialized yet. They almost KILLED me leaving me stranded sick at PHL 1am Christmas morning. #FridayThoughts
@steveken @PatchouliW @Avis Their social media people are TRYING but even they are coming up short. My family is still carting us around. Pretty much ruined the trip.
@cfranklinnews I am deeply saddened to hear of Bill's passing. In his honor, I am trying to organize a community meeting in the county to bring jobs back to Salem County. Can I get some help from you? I was born and raised here, and Bill wrote several articles about me!
@wildstein in honor of Bill's love for Salem County, I am trying to spread the word to bring jobs back here. Can you help me?? https://t.co/o7uomMr6lP
This guy has been a staple of local reporting my entire life. My local community will suffer from the loss of his reporting. He was one of the good ones. He will be dearly missed. https://t.co/4UTRcV0W8I
@wildstein Bill Gallo knew me and my mom very well. I am very saddened by the news of his passing. Any word on funeral arrangements? I'm home for Christmas from Colorado and would love to pay tribute to him.
@Budget are you going to ignore me too? you are about to lose millions of dollars in corporate accounts from your phenomenal fuckup. You dropped the ball big time.
@demaderios @Avis @Budget Thanks. My husband has reached out to @GetSpectrum to discontinue using them as well. They spend A LOT of money on rentals from them.
Despite @Avis @budget screw up, I am enjoying the first diner food I've had in a year. Oooooh I missed New Jersey! https://t.co/QJzBUBZNI3
Still nothing from @avis @Budget you're going to lose corporate accounts over this. You screwed up big time and you seriously don't care!
I DM'd and facebooked and reached out on linkedIn to @Avis. They are responding to everyone but me. Took my money, left me stranded, no refund on Christmas Morning. Way to treat your paying customers well. #ThingsImNotApologizingFor #DayAfterChristmas
@trekkieb47 @Avis I even DM'd them and silence. Wow.
@trekkieb47 @Avis Are they seriously replying to other people and not me? WOW.
@bmayzure @ellen @Avis @Alamo @Enterprise We are never using Avis ever again. Thanks for the heads up man! Maybe we'll go talk to @Alamo if we can find one here!!
@SouthwestAir Feeling much better today, especially after mom hugs! They'll fix ANYTHING :) &lt;3 &lt;3 thank you all so much again. I love you guys.
@SouthwestAir YOU GUYS ROCK and I still want to give that flight crew something special for helping me out through the worst sickness I've experienced ever. I love you guys so much.
@6abc I think I need to get you guys involved. This is absurd. They almost ruined my perfect Philly Christmas :( https://t.co/hpGAqTzU5Q
@bbb_us @Avis  left me stranded at PHL airport 1am Christmas morning because they had  no staff at their counter to give us keys for our prepaid rental car.  They refuse to refund us. They refuse to talk to us. Please spread the word, this is horrible customer service.
@ConsumerReports @Avis left me stranded at PHL airport 1am Christmas morning because they had no staff at their counter to give us keys for our prepaid rental car. They refuse to refund us. They refuse to talk to us. Please spread the word, this is horrible customer service.
Hey @SouthwestAir you guys should seriously not play with @avis. Look at what they did to us in Philly. 1am, Christmas morning, prepaid our car, no humans, they told us we were on our own and won't refund. Don't use them!!! That was after getting super sick on flight here.
I'm contacting every big corporate account I can find to tell them to not do business with @Avis after we prepaid our rental car and they left us stranded 1am xmas morning with no car at the airport, no refund, no response #DayAfterChristmas
@macfixer @Avis Yeah, how about no. A great big NOPE. I will make sure my husband's very large company doesn't use them for any rentals ever again. @Charter is a pretty large company to lose business from
@9NEWS look at this clusterfuck I had to deal with Christmas morning :( Avis tried to ruin Christmas, and they left us cold and stranded like a bad Christmas cliche #heynext https://t.co/2HTMT4Of9l
So @Avis almost ruined this wonderful Christmas surprise @Ellen. We still made it happen. Christmas miracles find a way. Tell you people @Avis doesn't care about Christmas or helping others. https://t.co/ZiKNKDTaAr
@trekkieb47 @Avis Thanks. They made Christmas way more complicated than it should have been. Almost ruined it.
@Big_in_VA @Avis Definitely do not use these people. How are they not gonna have staff at their counters? We could have walked in there and stolen all their shit if we wanted, but we're not terrible human beings like they are.
Hey @Ellen, do not do business with @Avis.They left us stranded Christmas morning at the Philly airport after we prepaid a car, no humans around, no phone help, no refund. Ruined our xmas. Look at the video of us surprising mom though!!! SO WORTH IT!!!
@RogueISP @Avis They left us stranded at PHL christmas morning 1am after we prepaid for a car. No humans at their area, no buses to the area, people on the phone were no help. They left us stranded. Won't give us our money back either. Nobody will talk to us!!
Going all out on @Avis for leaving us stranded at 1am Christmas Morning with no staff, after we prepaid our rental car, and told us we were out of luck and won't give us out money back. #ThingsImNotApologizingFor
Still silence from @Avis. I am seriously going to have to call the credit card company to get our money back. Wow.
@cheryl303 @Avis We booked directly through Avis hahahahah
Hey @TheEllenShow I got my mom good :) EVERYONE on the internet knew except her!!! https://t.co/ZiKNKDTaAr
@fairuse we could have been screwed so bad if my sister didn't come and get us.
@fairuse I don't understand how they could have NO staff at the counter. Like, people need to pick up their cars. Why don't you have anyone there to give the car????
Please RT that tweet about Avis. They took like $300 told us we cancelled and won't give us our money back. We did nothing wrong, they fucked up bad. Let's bring the fuckers down! https://t.co/Kv58DcAn3n
@PatchouliW @steveken @Avis ALL THE LAWYERS
Hey @Avis, how are you gonna say we cancelled when you had no staff at your counters to give us the car we paid for? We didn't cancel the car, you had no staff to give us the fucking car. You want us to get lawyers involved??
@steveken @Avis Dude, to make matters worse, I got SUPER sick on the flight so I was not well at all... standing in the cold, waiting for a shuttle that never came. Then we got india on the phone, who did nothing. We got nowhere.
@steveken @Avis they fucked up big time, like whoa. like what would have happened if my sister couldn't get us? that was terrifying at 1am.
So @Avis is trying to tell us we cancelled our prepaid rental car, which we arrived at PHL for at 11pm and there were NO HUMANS anywhere to be found. You will give us our money back or you will face the wrath of me, or a lawyer. YOU fucked this up, not us. Make it right!!! https://t.co/Yjk47yR5MN
@JonhaRichman @Avis @Resolver OMG @Avis yeah, it cancelled because you had NO HUMAN BEINGS AVAILABLE TO HELP US GET OUR ALREADY PAID FOR CAR https://t.co/O26xdZHaYI
@JonhaRichman @Avis @Resolver It's pretty absurd that they had NOBODY at their counter. Just touchscreens, and radios beeping about things we couldn't understand. We paid for the car, and Avis was like HAHAHA OH WELL! Worst customer service experience ever. Never again Avis. You're on the shitlist.
@Resolver I used to do your job. Avis fucked me over 11pm Xmas eve. We prepaid for a car, then get to philly and there are no humans or buses to the AVIS building. Then, they give us the runaround for 2 hours on the phone, ulitimatly ending with my sister picking us up. No refund
Still no word from @Avis about getting us our money back for a car we prepaid... and then wasn't available, and they had no humans staffing their counters. Never, EVER, going to use these guys again. This is ridiculous! What if my sister hadn't been able to get me?? Wow. FIX NOW.
1am PHL. @Avis rental area had no agents. Just touchscreens. No Humans to help us with our prepaid rental car. What are you going to do to make this right? My sister had to come get us and you won't give us back our money in a timely fashion. You guys dropped the ball HARD.
After @Avis spectacularly fucked up our car leaving us stranded 1am Christmas Day at PHL, this wonderful thing happened. Thanks again, @SouthwestAir! https://t.co/gbbrJyCEsR
@jtl999 man it sucked
Dear @SouthwestAir thank your crew for me. I got horrendously sick on the flight home mid flight and they took care of me like the champs they are. I love you guys.
@fairuse it was a miserable night and it royalty screwed up Christmas Morning.
My special Christmas turned into a nightmare. Got violently ill on the plane, then the rental car got fucked up and nobody from @avis was there to help at 1am Xmas morning. Then the hotel reservation got screwed too. What a mess :(
@DJRobertDrake @SouthwestAir we're on our way. i couldn't do gifts :( I will make their flight as painless as possible! https://t.co/UDs70PJNJv

@CReppWx WOW that's something i'd expect to see on a t-shirt. With a wolf... and some lightning.
@SouthwestAir depression hurts man and it's bad right now and i just keep crying so apologies to the crew ahead of time. I'm flying home to surprise mom and I'm still sad how stupid is that?

@cheryl303 @RideRTD Yeah, doesn't help the ugly crying right now though. I'm so passionate about public transportation. This was my dream job.
@KyleClark I only applied because I felt bad for them after watching the spot on your show :( I'm so passionate about public transportation. My dad works for Amtrak.
Hey @KyleClark you're right. I'm not sure they're interested in improving things.

@AriMelber friend got a text message from a Wyoming number asking to pick up her ballot in Colorado, which is shady as fuck. She will be hand delivering it today because of that text. How many people fell for it though?

I remember nights in the parking lot of the ACME by fashion bug, it would smell the color green. @fastlerner
@fastlerner you should check into the altantic city electric site on the other side of the bridge. lots of foul shit there too. my grandfather worked there.
I grew up in the shadow of Dupont in Pennsville. My grandfather worked there. My mom worked at the college next to it. I had a house less than a mile from it. I wonder what the hell they've done to me. @fastlerner https://t.co/PkMuxs2Nq0
@fastlerner am from pennsville, loved your article on chambers works. can we talk?
@cheerose thank you :)
Current problem: I know a lot of people. I mean, A LOT. The problem is figuring out where I met them. Yahoo, AIM, IRC, Forums, Games... who knows. I probably know you if I added you. Help me figure this out if you can!

@CReppWx It's hard to tell the weather by looks alone here, but backed up clouds usually mean wind. Cow shit smell means snow.

Remembered I used to hang out online with quantum physicists online before that was actually a field of study back in the day. My mom's best friend was a physicist, and she pointed me their way. They didn't care I was in high school, just that I was curious :) &lt;3

Another fun fact: I used to hang out online with a bunch of DJ's who weren't DJ's yet, listening to them make music and critiquing it. Why? Because I LOVE MUSIC, and I went to college to be a music teacher :D &lt;3
@Kalarigamerchic What district? I'm Boulder.
The twitter algorithm is scary good at finding people I used to talk to before twitter was even a thing. It's cool and terrifying at the same time.
@Kalarigamerchic We definitely talked back in the day. Memory is SLOWLY coming back the more I talk to people online, and the more music I listen to.
@Sub_ZeroProject you guys were making music way back in the early 00's, weren't you? did you hang out on IRC at all? i've been listening to you on google music all day, and all of this is SUPER FAMILIAR.
@Kalarigamerchic I was using a MUSH/MOO client to chat on https://t.co/EAE0Iczi0X and I vaguely remember Dragon's Era. We must go WAY back, lady!
@Kalarigamerchic i was serenity or serenarae or serenaraerini because i, too, was a huge sailor moon nerd!

@KarlBode she had every right to be mad. i felt bad for her.
This reminds me of when Mona smashed up that Comcast office in Virginia with a hammer. Spectrum, you guys are fucking up pretty bad... @KarlBode
Remembered the names of both my diaryland accounts AND both of my xangas last night. The archive online that is my brain is almost complete!!!! SO EXCITED!!!
So, this wild memory rabbit hole has just now concluded. I met my husband in Ultima Online in the early 00's, No wonder it felt like we always knew each other! #MeantToBe
@RogueISP *sigh
@RogueISP Wow...
I remember talking to a lot of people in the UK and Ireland over ICQ back in the day! I remember the Irish kids were learning Gaelic, which was fascinating to young me.
@KarlBode This doesn't surprise me at ALL.

If I have followed you in the last week, there's a chance we know each other. Let's try to figure out how! Twitter's algorithm is helping me figure this out. I hung out in a lot of infosec and crypto channels, it turns out. Thanks again for dealing with me through all of this!
I am cellogirl THANK YOU EVERYONE!
More fun facts: Because I worked mid-shift, I was up late at night. So most of my friends are also night-dwellers and Europeans online! They're also SUPER nerds, because we all were back then!
@Big_in_VA this is a new problem to encounter in life...
@Big_in_VA they were acquired a few times. my data is very very old. my account was established in 1997
We have established I was on QuakeNet. I don't actually play Quake (motion sickness) but I chatted A LOT on their IRC servers.
@Big_in_VA NO.
I'm pretty irritated Yahoo lost 14 years worth of data on me. My account was created in 1997.
@DrugSense does anyone man this account that I could DM? I need to ask a question from a very VERY long time ago.
@steveken RIGHT???
To the people who I'm inevitably freaking the fuck out by coming out of nowhere from 20 years ago... We may have played Entropia together. Also, my signal/telegram can be obtained by DM'ing me.
@fairuse just got back from taking friend's dog to the vet. time for me to relax too. almost 70 outside
@RogueISP @Oculophage The stupid was much easier to ignore.
@RogueISP I seem to be stirring up memories people also forgot over time. Much of our brains are indexed on old HDD and places on the internet that no longer exist.
@Oculophage I've been on it so long that I forgot vast swaths of it existed. The internet was a very small and MUCH different place back then.
@RogueISP Several. That's the problem D: I think I remember my SN's, that's also part of the problem. Recovering lost memories you purposely kept secret is proving difficult.
rapidly discovering that if you were on IRC in the late 90's or early 00's, we probably chatted...
@fairuse nice! sounds like a lovely day
@fairuse got five inches sunday, and it's been in the 60's the rest of the week lol
@JeffHolton a whole mess of terrible things that were completely out of my control happened all at once, and Comcast didn't really care. So, I had to leave. They knew they were fucking up, because they offered me a severance package to stay quiet about it for three years.

@mattblaze i was already following you on twitter, so we knew each other somehow. i used to be comcastbonnie
@mattblaze your name just sent me down another rabbit hole. we probably met on yahoo, icq, or AIM between 1997-2010. I know that's a long time &gt;_&lt;
@mattblaze i just remembered i know you! HI AGAIN!
@kymdouglas Girl, just saw you on Ellen. You have all of my best vibes being sent your way for a swift and healthy recovery!!
@HamiltonMorris I was on it for two years and didn't die. Yeah,  I almost did a few times, but I kept watch of heat sources and body temp...
@onezerosix It's pretty awesome!!! Thanks &lt;3
@skulldaisygimp I think helping my friend all weekend jogged my memory. I went into comcastbonnie mode and i think that jump started that part of my brain or something.
@Zigeunerin It was a pretty nasty crash. I was asleep when it happened, since my husband was driving. So, I didn't realize how bad the impact was I guess!
@berylmom Things are slowly getting better for me. I'm really glad to be feeling like ME again!
@Princess_Holly &lt;3 &lt;3
@berylmom yes m'aam. it was a combination of things: i had a nervous breakdown right before my wedding on 10/10/10, then this happened 8 days later, and my great grandmother died like, the day before or after this accident. My brain shut down.
Today, 8 years ago, the accident that caused me to leave Comcast and lose part of my memory happened. This week, I started getting my memory back. Thank you for sticking it out with me, folks. https://t.co/JO1oPSvzF5

If Italians celebrate their heritage on Columbus Day, and Irish folks celebrate their heritage on St. Patrick's Day, why can't black folks have a national day of celebrating their heritage? I'm not talking about Kwanzaa, either. US is a melting pot. Celebrate Diversity!

@MrSnarkyPants There is still much work to be done, I see.
@MrSnarkyPants I need to do more research into the cellular side. I'm pretty well-versed on the radio/tv side. Learned a lot about it when it went off inadvertently while working at Comcast.
@MrSnarkyPants Husband (who runs video ops for spectrum) sent me some video EAS stuff to read up on, so I'll be reading that tonight.
@MrSnarkyPants Good to know, but in a real emergency, wouldn't you want all of the communications avenues using EAS to trigger at once? If we're gonna test this shit, we should do it like it was a real emergency.
I would love to see the spike in traffic on cell networks as a result of the presidential EAS that just got sent out. Looks like it went out 2 minutes late over TV, though? My cell got nothin'. #PresidentialAlert
@CNS_Rhina How was I not following this account?
@craignewmark Thank you :)
I'm trying to bring a little CCBonnie to @RideRTD, (Denver's Regional Transportation District). You all know how much I love public transportation/helping people, and that I can take the abuse that comes from angry customers  ;) Tell @RideRTD your best experience with me! &lt;3
This entire roll of Glad trash bags is defective... but this trash bag is still smiling. https://t.co/sEcKOV2CZr
(Forgot to include it's ComcastBonnie. Whoops! Hard to keep track of folks changing their sn's...)
@craignewmark would you be willing to endorse my awesomeness for @RideRTD? *waves*
@RideRTD we need a mascot! https://t.co/i9hbBKsoSd

@banaifeldstein The announcer really makes this feel like it belongs on a real channel. I found it on /r/theocho!
@SteveStreza i can't believe i didn't know this was a thing until today...
Guys, I didn't know Maze Marble Races were a thing, and I can't stop watching now. It's like competitive Plinko. I need to start a league! https://t.co/Ehj2kGiS5M
@SteveStaeger Glad I could help! I've got plenty of these.
@SteveStaeger #HeyNext https://t.co/R6zRNwNh1g
to add to this: I've seen how Colorado and the military handle reports of assault, and i've been disgusted by it.
@SteveStaeger took in domestic violence victim and her child for a year. I have seen the system fail repeatedly for victims of sexual assault. I have seen her own family fail her. It's ugly stuff.
@FreddysUSA Done
@kristenkurtis They were also raised with Brands. Raised to trust them, to know their Brand will be there for them when they need Brand the most. But yes, what happened to families/villages looking out for one another?
I don't understand how @FreddysUSA consistently manages to poke a hole in the cup when making milkshakes. Today, hole was in the SIDE of the cup. Nice... Maybe reinforce bottom half of shake cups???
@dougblackjr *internet high five* people out here (CO) are saying it's horrifying, creepy, terrifying, and don't understand why I love it.

@SteveStaeger I currently own THREE crockpots in various sizes, and was gifted FOUR of the HUGE ones for my wedding. Wanna swap recipes?
@yoshicool My doctor requires a visit every four months just to keep track of meds and vitals. That's not a bad thing... you probably should too if your insurance allows it. #raredisorders
@Tawnie You've heard of showerbeer, right? Why not showerwine? :P
@SteveStaeger *in the shower
@SteveStaeger Firefighter trick (my dad is a lifer back in NJ): Lemons. Just douse yourself in lemons in the shows. Like literally squeeze lemon juice on you. It gets rid of the smoke smell. So do lemon-scented air fresheners :)
Whoops! https://t.co/CAEEsafwBA
@RideRTD The positions says: Only open to RTD employees at this time :/
@cardassianv0le Girl, was it the Cargill one? There's a facility here in CO that seems to have a recall every other week and that's naaaaaaaasty
Dear @RideRTD I've decided I really want to tweet with you fine folks. Please let this public transportation fangirl know when you need her!
The hold music for Colorado unemployment is pleasant, and mostly music I've played in chamber ensembles. I keep catching myself fingering the notes for the cello part.
I love that @NJTVNews is putting the spotlight on the garden part of The Garden State, my home! We are generations of passionate people keeping watch over fertile land. We know its worth. #NJTVIYN
@RideRTD PS: I very badly want to work with that badass grandma. She reminds me of my own.
@RideRTD Definitely keep me posted! The job I thought I was going to do fell through :x
@RideRTD I just got laid off from my latest gig, looks like you need a "me"? I am a daughter of public transportation, specifically rail!
Hey @RideRTD I know how it feels to take the abuse... I used to work for Comcast's social media team :/ #HeyNext
@lindsaypell I dunno, I was close enough that he signed my phone üòç
@covercash I'm adding your subreddit to my subreddit's side bar
@SteveStaeger My mom loved that show because there were so few badass ladies on TV back then.
Dear @pauloakenfold, thanks for signing my phone! You did not disappoint this gal tonight :) &lt;3 https://t.co/1D3567Ya9b
@SteveStaeger You looked VERY excited about the whole interview, so I understand why :)
@SteveStaeger did you just get petted on air by a breakin' dude? ü§£

@Panel2TRex @xpnmorningshow Ehhh wait till he's older and able to appreciate music beyond sesame street and daniel tiger :)
@RogueISP some sort of endangered woodpecker made a nest out of a fiber bundle. had to wait for wildlife officials to relocate the bird/fiber piece. took a few hours.
@RogueISP At least I had non-backhoe incidents... like a woodpecker taking out data to hundreds of thousands of CA people back in the day.
@RogueISP Depending on who you work for, that could mean any number of things. Hope it wasn't a backhoe.
@RogueISP i hope you DO manage to wake up soon. &lt;3

@Panel2TRex @xpnmorningshow @wxpnfm You may enjoy my bazillion hour nostalgia list, which i'm adding to over the course of today as i hear stuff that's missing. I just put it on shuffle and BAM. All the nostalgic feels. https://t.co/5MNfDG9c08
@RogueISP You might say... you can't even because coffee :P
No bluetooth toggle still. Device Manager refreshes every second, BT driver is up to date, even un/reinstalled it. Balls. (logitech receiver is a dongle, not onboard bluetooth) https://t.co/VrHvrH9bEf
Oh xpn .. I just want tomorrow and its brightness like sunny morning light. fuck last days of work. #TBTXPN
Today is my last working day. Bluetooth on my PC suddenly doesn't exist when i woke up. Mass uninstall of shit going on. Already tried reinstalling drivers. Fucking whatever, today.
@steveken I don't handle rejection well...
@chrysics @imgur I AM MOUNTAIN HEAR ME ROAR
A fitting FB memory after our discussion on appropriate maintenance times during @imgur happy fun maintenance time yesterday. Time adjusted since that was East and now I am Mountain. https://t.co/ciA0a9RJ4F
@stephenkallao @wxpnfm One day in high school down in Salem County (across from Wilmington) our boiler broke in winter... the wrong way. Walked in to 104F inside the school, and one VERY angry 150+ year old cello :(
At least they were quick with their rejection for the job. :|
@MichaelAvenatti Stop. My justice boner can't get any bigger. :P
Only in Colorado... this is the same place I saw "Would you like to learn recorder?" with little tear-offs that said NO THANKS https://t.co/u19nlynuOL
@imgur Any idea when I can get to my pics again? It's been almost six hours :(
@imgur WE'RE ALL SLEEPLESS HUSKS HERE MY FRIENDS.
LOL. Hey guys, did you know there's never a good time to conduct maintenance? I'm going to take the high road here and just say that 1am-4am maintenances that took out all internet/video/phone services worked pretty well for me... Non-peak usage hours FTW. https://t.co/pOW90PrONq
@imgur 1am-4am was standard maintenance window when I worked at cumcast... just sayin. Worked out pretty well for us when people lost all their phone/internet/tv, instead of just pics :P
@stephenkallao I did not know this was a statement by a band/musician. In which case, she's leaving people waiting who spent money expecting a show to start on time. If I started playing a wedding late in my quartet, I'd be in a LOT of trouble... Obligatory Kallao cat tax: https://t.co/OcvrwBHVWH

@stephenkallao Quality over speed any day.
@ALT_uscis Mmmmm yes. Mom was a social worker, so I know the fuckery black folks go through. They'd come eat with us when they had no food or money. Where's their millions eh? (Got lice once because of other kids we were helping.) #NoRegrets
@ALT_uscis TBI's are a thing. Didn't we have a whole movie about this with Will Smith???
@xpnmorningshow beating myself up for brain farts during my interview :( Trying to soothe my brain with Sigur Ros this morning. https://t.co/eSAGLM0uiy
So incredibly angry with myself because I don't think I was at my best during my interview yesterday. I really like this company, a lot, and would love to work for them. But my stupid poo brain had to go and fuck it up. #TuesdayThoughts
@sherean @comcastcares :) What can I say... I love helping people, STILL! I try to do what I can when I can. Took in domestic violence lady and her kid for a year. Taking helping to another level since moving to Colorado!
@sherean @comcastcares I haven't been since January 2011 :(
Throwback to 2010 with the @comcastcares team https://t.co/F0nCOVI5ew
Could you use some help? Just asking is more than staying silent. #HowYouCouldHelpIn5Words
@xpnmorningshow Thank you, Loves! trying to maintain over here... and figure out wtf to wear since CO is very uh, laid back in interviews. Too fancy, scare them off. Too underdressed, look like a slob.
I keep seeing people younger than me post about how awful McCain was in the past with his decisions. Hey folks? He apologized AND expressed remorse for those decisions. You make mistakes, too. Remember that. How will history look back upon you?
@xpnmorningshow with me luck at my in person interview today! so nervous, even though i shouldn't be. GAHHHH. Mom/Dad get here Friday though, bringing me jersey tomatoes and corn &lt;3 &lt;3
3 working days after today, then mom and dad arrive Friday. Got that in-person interview today, and I'm pretty excited. #MondayMotivation
@SteveStaeger John McCain is a goddamned American Hero.

Teacher friends: Who needs supplies for their classrooms? Send me what you need the most. Reddit isn't doing the teacher exchange anymore, so I need a teacher to do this for. (both mom and mom-in-law are teachers, and I went to college to  be one, so I get it)

@MichaelAvenatti It's a wonderful day to be an American and watch the legal system do its job &lt;3
@TimesCall As someone who grew up in the shadow of the Manhattan Project and Dupont, even WITH cleanup, the land will be tainted for many MANY years. I'm never setting foot on it.

@steveken If I don't train my replacement, I don't get severance. Yes, my boss knows I should stay, but HIS boss made the decision.
Be great. Rise above the bullshit. Make the world a better place. This video really hit me in the feels this morning, folks. https://t.co/GPU1tfFtvn #MondayMotivation
Only 8 more working days of this job... Ugh. Training my replacement and working a gig that I know I'm not going to have end of next week is just... soulcrushing.
@kristenkurtis It's YOUR wedding. Who cares? You do NOT have to follow the rules. I sure as hell didn't, and everyone in attendance said it was the most awesome wedding they'd ever been to.
I really appreciated how all the news broadcasts lead with the news of Aretha's passing... and dedicated many minutes to her. The orange shitgibbon came second, which must have infuriated the shit out of him.
@xpnmorningshow I didn't realize till I moved out here how uncommon oldies are to most people. I grew up around this stuff w/Philly and Jersey Shore being so close. Weird to not hear it all summer.
@bouldercounty @DaddyDaddymac @bdonahueweedman @realDonaldTrump @GOP @BoCoClerk I reached out via email several days ago and have not received any response.
@xpnmorningshow I was waiting on the side of the highway in Vermont for Phish's Coventry, then the National Guard wouldn't let people in due to intense rains. Poor Phans :(
@SteveStaeger i, too love looking through newspaper archives :D  (sorry tonight's broadcast is depressing. trying to lighten things up :)
@SteveStaeger people have their faces in their devices too much...  they don't notice the world around them and miss indicators of crazy people.
@SteveStaeger ooooh you're playing anchor tonight! Let's dress up as t-rex's and conduct a symphony of Colorado players :) less depressing than murder
I live near the airport where the tankers refuel and get more orange goo for the area. Badass doesn't begin to cover how badass they are.

@aliciamalone @glamourpussLLC @AdelynRae @tcm She's got the eye for the perfect mix of classic and modern stuff when she dresses people on TCM. Should be called it's own genre of fashion!
@yoshicool I don't own a home here though, so that's a moot point. In NJ, they did not publish your voter reg info, and CO never told me they did :( Found out the hard way when someone showed up at my door.

@jack_daniel @SufferinBa5tard His grandparents got the Inn listed on the national registry of historic places when they owned it, too. https://t.co/hGtI6T8oJO
@jack_daniel @SufferinBa5tard Inn is in Yarmouth (port?). Husband lived next to Bobby Byrnes in Hyannis. I loved it up there, and we need to get back sooner than later. Airfare is kinda nuts from CO to MA though.
@CReppWx Sandy made landfall north of where wx folk expected it to, which spared my part of NJ. Irene though... that flooded the bejesus out of my neighborhood. Nothing worse than 8 inches of rain in 3 hours though, in freak storm.
@jack_daniel @SufferinBa5tard :o you lived there when he did then... and when I was driving up there every other weekend from south jersey to see him. hyannis/barnstable area. his grandparents owned liberty hill inn!
@xpnmorningshow Doug is streaming on Hulu not FYI! (So is Daria). Do yourself a favor and don't look up the prices of the Pete &amp; Pete dvd's :( Holy crap. cc @kristenkurtis used to sing doug opener acapella w/friends :)
@jack_daniel @SufferinBa5tard Wait, you're on the Cape? That's where my husband is from!!!
@xpnmorningshow I HAVE THIS ALBUM BECAUSE OF PETE &amp; PETE. I need to get that series on DVD or something... cc @kristenkurtis
@CReppWx I feel the need to emphasize HELPING THE NEIGHBORS. When flooding happens, your elderly neighbors are stuck. Clean out the drains, get your marsh boats/kayaks, and help them out. Check on them at least! (Irene was worse than Sandy for us, BTW!)
I was just telling @RogueISP this, but with all the vitriol I have for Comcast, I am not shitting on their employees. They rock. I am shitting on management (but not all of them, there are good ones).
Did you know... Some states publish your full name, address, and affiliation when you register to vote? If you've moved, and have privacy concerns, you might want to ask about this before registering. See if you can have your info made private w/ county clerk.
@RogueISP I married a field tech &lt;3 Comcast love boat. He's moved on up in the cable world though.
@RogueISP I worked with some AMAZING people there. It's just a shame all those talented and dedicated people are continually fucked over. Gimme a follow back and then I can DM you :P
@RogueISP BUT, to be fair, the employees of Comcast aren't the problem. It's their management. See the post from yesterday I made about one fantastic tech being selfless.
@RogueISP I occasionally email their PR people begging for a job :P I'd love to use my powers for good! I was TRYING to do that at comcast.
@RogueISP I was there when they started with the caps. Their own meter couldn't accurately keep track of how much data you used. People had to set up their own monitors on their routers to prove CC wrong. Huge clusterfuck.
@RogueISP Actually trying to move to Longmont, with their fabulous municipal broadband, and no fuckery like Sandvine (that I know of, yet). Still in Telco world sort of because of my husband.
@RogueISP You know Sandvine has been doing all sorts of fuckery since AT LEAST 2007. I have a Sandvine frisbee, actually... They got caught throttling shit at Comcast though, and had to lay off the traffic shaping until people forgot it existed again.
@CReppWx Don't forget the hurricane parties! When the power goes out, there's nothing left but to drink all the booze :P Within reason. If it's really bad out, need to be sober to help the neighbors.
@RogueISP I am the holder of Comcast's only customer service award, ever. There six years, eventually had a nervous breakdown. Still recovering :P Also, grew up around infosec people, so howdy!
@blankbaby Wait, you have a Trek podcast and I haven't been on it??? :o
@jack_daniel But... I married someone from Massachusetts! Granted, he is a Masshole, but I'm from Jersey soooooo it all works out in the end :D
@JohnCollins @MatchaBarNYC ROFL
@DaddyDaddymac @bdonahueweedman @realDonaldTrump @GOP Only if CO will make an exception for me and not publicly publish my voter info, including my affiliation and address. Got stalkers :( Working on it, though. Need @BoulderCounty Clerk to get back to me :/
@toastido You having an emo night over there, toastido?
@CReppWx Just so you know: My sisters and I would dance in the streets during the worst of the hurricanes in NJ (yes, even Sandy), and call ourselves the Rain Tribe. And yes, we thoroughly disinfected afterwards. Flooded roads are gross.
@glamourpussLLC @aliciamalone @AdelynRae @tcm I am so jealous of Alicia with that FANTASTIC red hair. She can pull off so many amazing looks! Of course, Holly is the one who makes it all come together, though :) Thanks for reminding me to follow Alicia!
From one concerned citizen to another, I fear for the future of our democracy and the United States, too. This guy was CIA director for four years. https://t.co/vpv6U2J7RY
@comcast I can give you his name in a DM if you want to give this tech proper recognition for being awesome. you have to promise they won't get in any trouble, though!
I had to share this from a cable group I belong to. This Comcast tech deserves a bonus or a nice case of beer or SOMETHING. That kid will remember the kindness of that tech for life! &lt;3 YOU HEAR THAT @COMCASTCARES??? https://t.co/2WQIuZBHy1
@kristenkurtis That's just like, your opinion, man -Big Lebowski
Motherfucking Windows update reinstalled/enabled a ton of drivers I uninstalled or disabled (for a good reason) and I DO NOT APPROVE. Also, it restarted my PC last night, and forced me to again this morning to install the updates. Ugh. #Windows10
@yoshicool Oh boo. My windows machine bluescreens if I have a bluetooth device attache while it does updates... Usually repeatedly while I'm asleep too.
@yoshicool Yeah I got that part. I had to learn how to do that in linux for the rare cumcast customer that called in running linux. It's kinda weird it would essentially crash your shit though lol.
@yoshicool indeed! but did you have some sort of kernel panic in your highlighted bit? i know what's going on up top...
In today's installment of training my replacement: I notify the bossfolk of the many things I did in the background they didn't realize. Not being malicious, but blog and support domain are attached to my personal gmail...

I don't pray, but I am sending good vibes to the Queen of Soul, @ArethaFranklin Reports say she is gravely ill. Celebrate her life while she's still living, folks. #MondayMotivation
@xpnmorningshow be safe, Philly area! You know lots of rain in low lying areas=flooding, which you should never drive through. K? We're smart listeners right? :)
@GeorgeChakiris_ You should try to get your account verified! It will help people to know if you really are the REAL George Chakiris :)
Whelp, Comcast is down. 75% sure one of the fiber contractors running the new shit in my community is to blame :/
Didn't sleep at all Weds into Thurs. Had half a cheeseburger on Weds, and a hot dog Thurs. I think me getting laid off is manifesting differently this go-around... and it sucks. #FridayFeeling
@wxpnfm are you folks having stream problems today? I don't use your web player (it eats too many resources), and use the stream links posted on your site. Stream is stopping, pausing, skipping around.

@Jarime Don't work in telcom anymore, thank gawd. Been doing webapp stuff mostly, supporting and deploying it.
I am very sorry for all the ranting, my beloved tweeps. I seldom handle lay-offs well, but I'm handling this one a lot better than the last few. I'm not in a deep pit of depression, yet. Just the OMGANXIETY of the unknown.
I was given another BASH task last night (still learning, folks) and am reminded of how terribad I am at math. Education system failed me there :(
@kristenkurtis this is why I try to take the train whenever possible :P Only started flying since I moved out here, and there's no trains :(
@DJRobertDrake It's a cool 59F here right now... but it'll warm up later today. CO Springs had baseball-softball sized hail last night :x

#IStartMyDayBy trying not to freak out about training my replacement at work, or getting that permanent crown put in... or the possibility of finding a new job. #anxietyproblems 2mg klonopin just to sleep last night :(
7:20am permanent  crown put in. After that, get to train my replacement :/ What a wonderful day.
Facebook appears to be broken... https://t.co/vrua84r0FZ
@waynedixon I will give dudebro the best documentation/training I can do, because regardless of how shitty the situation is, I never fuck over my customers.
@covercash I will give dudebro the best documentation I have, because regardless of how shitty the situation is, I never fuck over my customers.
@robini71 It'll be OK. This has to be the fourth time this has happened to me now. Never fired, always laid off.
@kristenkurtis @xpnmorningshow sad news :( I probably won't be awake early enough for your show anymore. Got laid off yesterday, last day is 8/31. Train my replacement rest of month though!
I got laid off because my parent company said I cost too much, and don't like me working remotely (when they couldn't find anyone locally). I train my cheaper replacement Monday. Wonderful for the #JobsReport since someone else gets hired while I'm laid off.
I guess I can say it now... I'm laid off end of this month, and I have to train my cheaper, on-site replacement starting Monday. #friyay? More like let me have a brain vacation.
@wxpnfm whoever picked "Don't Worry, Be Happy!" a little bit ago, thanks. I needed it right then and there for reasons I can't tweet out yet. Gonna be a rough day ahead, and I have #TBTXPN to get me through it.
@JeffHolton I was building onboarding technical training. Was the first besides my manager on my team to be let go. Ticket stats were bad because I was working on that onboarding project :(
Hey infosec followers! My good buddy @forwardsecrecy is out doing his own infosec thang, and might be a fun person to follow :) We started in the Cumcast trenches together way back in the day. He's good people!
@robini71 I wish you could see the picture of kiddo and I on Sunday. She and I are both SO smiley in it!
@6abc how far back does your online archive go? looking for the excellent shot chopper 6 took of my town when it was on fire back in 2001. Google is failing me!
@cardassianv0le Reminder that not all crotchfruit are rage-inducing :) &lt;3 But yes, they're particularly annoying at airports.
@jack_daniel @forwardsecrecy @joshcorman Awwww now kiss :P I'm actually pretty close to Webroot's building. VMWARE is right next to it out here!
@jack_daniel I almost didn't recognize you at first. You have an actual pic! Do you and @forwardsecrecy know each other? He's an infosec dude too, and we braved the front lines of Cumcast together...
@jack_daniel It's goin! Slowly getting my life back together/focusing on me after two years of focusing on helping a domestic violence victim and their child. Getting my teeth fixed finally, which is a huge help. How are you dude??
@jack_daniel Hey my grumpy friend! Long time no see :)
I like this hashtag. It's because I liked the 140 character limit, which kept rants to a minimum and folks like me with A.D.D. able to stick with tweeting. Plus that whole winning @shortyawards was a nice perk :) I loved helping you all! Miss it a lot. #WhyIJoinedTwitter
@toastido you're over by audi and landrover dealers arent you!
@toastido dude i can see my apartment complex. WHERE ARE YOU
@toastido dude you're very close to me. when do you fly out? i dont read a lot of my tweets because i have so many people i follow D:
@toastido WHAT? YOU'RE HERE???
#ColoradoDay 142 years old... My aunt and uncle back in NJ live in a house that's WAY older than this state. https://t.co/gfUipEjXFf
Dear @xpnmorningshow listeners, I will love you if you get me a recording of Sail Us To The Moon if it gets played tonight. Or even Pyramid Song! Sold last night's tix to pay for trip to see parkinsons diagnosed grandma :/
@JeffHolton Oh yeah? I was vCloud Air, which they did a shit job of deploying too late. Lasted a whole six months after moving out here.
@xpnmorningshow this is one of my drive around crying songs...
@yoshicool WE ARE HARDCORE IN NEW JERSEY.
@yoshicool Tell her the climate has changed so much, we really don't get that much snow :( Most of the winter feels like spring back east.
@yoshicool Also, I had "zero period" every day of high school. Started at 7am, all music ensembles. MWF "Strolling Strings" Tues "Riverview Chamber Players" Thurs "Riverview Quarter" followed by another three hours of music classes.
@yoshicool It doesn't snow THAT much here. Everyone thinks CO is all winter wonderland. Winters here are a joke compared to NJ. It's just COLD and humid right now, and the humidity makes everything feel cold when you dont have any for weeks at a time :P
@yoshicool I start at 8am EST... which is 6am MST. It's so early, and cold. Why is it 51F at the end of July??
@steveken the job is all software side lol you never physically touch the hardware. it's a video noc for all of spectrum's video nationally
@steveken video engineer which is very networking heavy
@steveken Not really, there's a lack of people for the jobs around. For example: The Burger King across the street from me reduced their hours because they can't find employees. They start at $11 an hour...
@steveken Balls. Well, that sucks. I know the feeling of being stuck not finding work even though you're qualified :( Unemployment is under 3% in Denver Metro. Wild!
@steveken You'd be surprised who he'll hire. Varied backgrounds make for a better team. Plus, he'll relocate you if you fit the bill. I also have issues with the elevation the first two weeks I'm back from sea level. Gotta prep before coming here!
@steveken ROFL. Well, my husband needs engineers?
@steveken If I could make an excel sheet that did everything I need it to calculate, I could sell it as an alternative to the product I support LOL
@steveken Have page bookmarked, but when you throw in all of these weird shift differentials and overtime things, it makes my eyes pop out of my head.
I am not really great at math (I'd like to be better) and work in a job that requires me to constantly convert 1/60th times to 1/100th times... and my brain is just all sorts of full of fuck when I do it. Too early for this on a Monday!
This needs a restoration! https://t.co/Z5t3NdaQPP
I love that @tcm is playing a biography of Skippy the Wirehair Terrier. This is awesome!
@justdannyso There was a complicated family issue that precipitated this particularly terribad bout of depression. Now that's it's resolved, depression magically disappeared ;) It's nice to feel motivated enough to take care of myself again :P
The original King Kong might look hokey as fuck now, but that was cutting edge special FX back in the day. #respectyourroots
@SteveStaeger I didn't know you functioned this early in the day :P
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA *deep breath* HAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  IT HAPPENED! https://t.co/5dzlEYJIhH
@jtl999 SO incredibly happy. It's like a heavy fog has lifted from my life.
Material objects are just objects. Family, blood or not, is WAY more important than objects. I learned this last night. I am far happier having family back in my life, than having the object. #FridayMotivation
When squirt bottles aren't enough to deter your dog-sized cat, you have to upgrade to a supersoaker. *sigh*
I need to tell you all I had been in a crippling depressive state since Sept like when I had that nervous breakdown at Comcast. Came out of the fog of it last week. I feel so overjoyed by everything in the world right now, and I'm having a tough time handling it! #FridayFeeling
@cardassianv0le Age is a number. You dress to impress yourself. Your body is your fuckin temple and it's not ugly. It's just aging like a fine amazing cheese or wine, and gets more fabulous with age :D
@xpnmorningshow i hope you guys play kelce's speech somewhere. the most inspiring moment in philly sports ever.
@xpnmorningshow E_A_G_L_E_S EAGLES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
For those of you who don't know, we took in a domestic violence victim and her child for a year. Some stupid shit caused us to stop talking to each other in September. It really was stupid. Family is more important than things. #Friyay
Guys, kiddo's mom and I made up last night. Got to see kiddo on video for the first time in nine months. My heart is so full of happiness today! VERY MUCH #FRIYAY!!!! We're having a pool party this weekend together :) :) &lt;3 &lt;3
Happy Sysadmin day, friends! Remember to take care of yourselves. I've lost six sysadmin friends to overworking themselves. One was found dead at his desk on Christmas. Take care of yourselves, PLEASE.
@MaestroMitchell Hey Brett, anyway to see YYM at RR? I didnt get tix because I was going to fly to Philly for Radiohead, but sold my tix because OMG EXPENSIVE FLIGHTS. Also, any recommendations for luthiers of 200 year old cellos?
@SteveStaeger Looking back on tweets, I may have come on a *smidge* hard. I get excited about stuff :)
@rogersramkoski PRETTY!!!
@CReppWx @beckyditchfield @NWSBoulder Looks like the storms back home &lt;3
@SteveStaeger @MaestroMitchell I am actually a cellist! I went to college to be a music teacher and ended up in tech &lt;3 we had season tickets to co symphony last season!

@SteveStaeger There weren't many corporate tweeters back in the day and we were figuring this out as the platforms grew. Exciting time to be in that line of work :) Lots of crazy shit though!
@SteveStaeger I'm a nerd. There are nerdier nerds than me, and that's cool... but I'm a nerd who happens to have a passion to help people :)
@SteveStaeger Sorry, I just smoked a bowl while watching a rad storm. https://t.co/paRjebXraS my brief moment of internet fame! I love helping people, what can I say üòã I got to meet THE GROVER with his handler from Sesame Street! Highlight of my career. see also https://t.co/Q8R9WqWxRB
@SteveStaeger did you know.... i hold a customer service award for COMCAST? i think it's still the only customer service award they've ever received :P #internetfame

@SteveStaeger You're fun and exude nerrrrrrd which is a-ok :) I enjoy watching you sub for @KyleClark

@KyleClark You need a professional twitter stalker who's been at it 10 years to get the info you need :P
RE: Trump Hollywood Star Smashing	Never EVER support violence and destruction of personal property to get your point across. I hate the orange shitgibbon as much as the next person, but let's  be civil human beings. Remember Martin Luther King and Ghandi's lessons.
@TheDemCoalition @realDonaldTrump Never EVER support violence and destruction of personal property to get your point across. I hate the orange shitgibbon as much as the next person, but let's  be civil human beings.
Also, this happened with a previous Windows10 update, where I had to uninstall Checkpoint SSL VPN to get my network adapters working again. WTF WINDOWS UPDATES?!
5:30am sit at PC, no net. Reset modem&lt;router&lt;uninstall network adapters&lt;flush all the things... no dice. Mind you, I got a Windows10 update last night. The root cause? AT&amp;T Global Connect Client. Had to completely uninstall and BAM, all my connections worked.
@kristenkurtis Girrrrrl I am so excited for you :)
@fairuse We got plenty of flooding here... I saw @Hersheypark is closed INDEFINITELY because of the flood waters. So glad I don't have to worry about that anymore being up on a hill. NJ old house, every rain meant whole road was flooded.
@fairuse We got SO MUCH RAIN yesterday. It was glorious!
God damnit teamviwer. First, you let me buy a full-priced license, when you knew in two months you were switching to a subscription model. Now this shit. Don't forget the massive "hack" awhile back either. Not looking good for these guys. https://t.co/Khbc3aqOAJ
@DJRobertDrake @wxpnfm Shall I send you another FANTASTIC ornament? This year I have more time to think about it ;)
Hey @linuxacademyCOM do you guys offer scholarships for women trying to break away from M$? I'd really like to get in on the nix side!!!
CHECK YOUR GENERICS, PEOPLE! THEY MIGHT HAVE CHANGED!	And with that said, now you know why I am accidentally taking wrong meds. Pill color and shapes changed suddenly, pharm tech (i love my pharmacist, really) didn't tell me it changed.
This is impacting all sorts of drugs. SO many manufacturers have consolidated their operations into centralized sites. When one of those sites goes down, EVERYONE suffers. Check out this list of all the drugs currently having shortages: #TuesdayThoughts https://t.co/nojtI0wcOs
@jtl999 dude i have had the same generics for SEVEN YEARS, then the last fill they changed because there are super shortages of like everything. I have a name brand inhaler for the first time since I was a kid because no generics in stock.
Philly fans get a bad rep, but look at the multiple standing ovations they gave Chase Utley last night. We love our sports heroes. If we could hold the Notorious RBG in the same regard, that would rock! #TuesdayThoughts
OK I have moved my klonopin to another room. I accidentally took it and my adderall AGAIN today and I don't like it. I need to stop being a space cadet. STOP THE DRUG SHORTAGES AND GIVE ME MY NORMAL GENERICS!!!!
@DJRobertDrake We just got INCHES of GLORIOUS RAIN! It'll help out wildfires out SO MUCH &lt;3
@AndrewHashem @borklander @HotDinnerBatman wut
@yoshicool Sexy
I forgot my mother in law is a george washington scholar and a graduate of Suffolk Law. Stand by for another opinion on this matter.
HELP. I NEED A CONSTITUTIONAL LAW EXPERT TO MAKE MY BRAIN STOP WONDERING ABOUT THIS TWEET SITUATION. #MondayMorning
Today is going to be an interesting day when you accidentally take your adderall AND klonopin at the same time because the generics changed the shape and color. Woooooboy.
One thing I wonder: Can twitter legally remove the president's tweet? The courts ruled he can't block anyone, and tweets are historical record of presidential comments...
Please report this tweet for violating the Twitter ToS. I already did. This is inciting violence against others, a big NONO. https://t.co/BFJpt8OTea

@xpnmorningshow I remember singing this at the place in Great Adventure that let you record yourself singing popular songs in recording booths. No Doubt has been a part of my life for ages, too :) &lt;3
@DrewHamilton I dunno, it's pretty bad... It's hard to find things bad enough to equate to the orange shitgibbon. Either he's holocaust level bad, or IE level bad... take your pick.

@mikesisak Also, hello new reporter I haven't seen on my feed before! :) I was in the NY Times once upon a time... You're in one of the noble professions, spreading the light of truth (or trying to, which is difficult these days).
@mikesisak @SouthwestAir I think I heard on the news that it wasn't a safety issue so much as people just don't like airline peanuts.
@SouthwestAir I'll see you when I surprise my mom xmas morning. What should I bring my flight crew for xmas eve? Definitely NOT peanuts!
@SouthwestAir Yup, that is EXACTLY why :) Here's some of their cheer from Dec 9th last year! https://t.co/rqb6pN1wHM
@SouthwestAir @FlySJC @PHXSkyHarbor One day, I saw a giant salmon fly by my window... out of KBJC, a municipal airport. Talk about confusing! You should have done up the whole plane like a shark... maybe meme sharks from the superbowl? :P
@SouthwestAir but it's ok. Removing peanuts makes the cabin safer for everyone, and most people aren't as IN to peanuts as I am :P
@SouthwestAir I will never forget the time my awesome flight crew saw my excitement over airline peanuts (i love them) and gave me something like 50 bags of them. This is why I fly with you - the awesome people!
This spot @KyleClark did last night (that dreamy grandpa's blazer-wearing hunk) embodies what a lot of us are thinking right now. Give it a rest, focus on the important things, and stop pushing your shit on me. https://t.co/v8iQUj5Fc1
@fairuse @Cinemax telcos do not have a history of letting companies they acquire do what they're best at.
@fairuse att always says make money XYZ. that is their way :P way to make a rookie mistake and push yourself too hard! at least i'm miserable from the comfort of my home office.
@perthguppy @yoshicool better than what TV was offering people with licenses per month... the low low price of like $35 per month for existing license holders. Yeah, ok no thanks.
@perthguppy @yoshicool BAD UI/UX! Hrm.
@perthguppy @yoshicool you rock :) but do i need a trial password??
@perthguppy @yoshicool yeah imma need you to link us to free shit, cause i can't find it on the connectwise site ;)
@perthguppy @yoshicool i think i read in /r/sysadmin screenconnect isn't free anymore? looks like they got bought out?
@perthguppy @yoshicool my issue is my clients, and which remote tools they support :( bulk are small businesses, which aren't run like big company IT depts... if they have IT at all.
@xpnmorningshow MORE CLASSICAL BANJO PLS
@yoshicool Right? It's easy to get my less techy users to run. Gotomeeting is becoming far too complicated with it's multiple prompts and windows and sometimes running a lite client or having UAC issues in Windows :(
I just read that domestic violence incidents increase during sporting events, like the World Cup. If you are worried for your safety during/after matches, I am here to help.
@WangingOut FUCK YOU WANGBOT GET IN THE CHANNEL
@craignewmark @ProSyn Growing up with the internet since 94 helped me to pick through the disinfo noise. There was a disinfo site for awhile, and I think it turned into infowars... internet of then vs now is like letting toddlers into a chem lab.
@blankbaby Open offices are a great way to encourage your employees to make box forts for privacy... and extremely shitty for people like me with sensory processing disorders.
@WangingOut COME BACK TO THE CHANNEL YOU ASSHOLE BOT.
Apparently Teamviewer is now slang for "do you wanna fuck remotely", which really amuses and confuses the shit out of my sysadmin brain. Wow, what a world we live in! :P
@fairuse I'm still recovering, they ended up pulling three while fixing the bottom. Body is not happy. Lots of hot/colds and puking.
The boys and the coach are out of the cave! Now just get those kids out of the immigrant detention centers and reunited with their parents with the same excitement and urgency as 12 Thai boys half a planet away. #ThailandCaveRescue

@xpnmorningshow hello from the dentist chair early this morning https://t.co/pP1y3feVGG
As much as I love to shit on Comcast, the issue with your connection is appears to be Level3's fault... as usual when it comes to nationally impacting outages.
It kinda feels like Comcast is shitting the bed nationally right now...
@yoshicool It's supposed to  be in the mid-90's here today, and 102 tomorrow. UGH.
@infowolfe appetite disappeared too, though soup sounds awesome. i'll have to grab some later today!
@infowolfe I've got a fever from an infection and a serious case of the stupids today, apparently. Not getting more than four hours sleep last night and the night before isn't helping either :(
@infowolfe Fuck, you're right.
@fairuse i wish i could get a nap!!! up all night. no bueno.
@fairuse i've just got an infection :/ dentist monday morning, but kinda fucked until then
@fairuse He's probably twice the size she is though, but she still kicks his ass. Moose, the other male, and him get along splendidly. Moose takes pity on Merlin because he's truly stupid. Moose bopped him on the head, and Merlin just sat there like "HEY FRIEND!" and Moose just pitied him
@fairuse Not really. He's pretty chill for a huge cat! Though, him and the bengal are mortal enemies... I hope I dont throw up my stinking adderall.
@fairuse Our big guy, Merlin, is bigger than Mylo...
@SpataTimes That is awesome! We have dudes out here who get to play with actual cannons to do avalanche control.
You know what sucks? Waking up at 2:30am with a fever and not being able to get back to sleep... I couldn't eat yesterday either, so now I'm tired and hungry but still can't eat :/ At least tomorrow's Friday?
@yoshicool Pants? In this heat? People are crazy. I'm dreading a doctor's appt later today because I have to put pants on, and it's supposed to be in the upper 90's :(
@robini71 Ginger Ale is a lifesaver when you don't have medical marijuana handy!

@steveken it's sad because i did this last month and there were zero problems... i'm confused why orders #2 and #3 were so fucking difficult
@steveken the delivery people are contractors kind of like door dashers. it stops being amazon's problem when the order says its delivered - amazon no longer knows who delivered the order, which is slightly terrifying.
@steveken I paid for the first, which they refunded immediately after TWO calls, which was applied to order #2, which was missing a bag that never showed up. Amazon wants me to call or email them a THIRD time, and I'm like... fuck it. It hurts to talk right now.
@SpataTimes @replyall That's.... disturbing. :P
My reaction when I hear @kristenkurtis on @WorldCafe fundraising for @wxpnfm instead of on the @xpnmorningshow https://t.co/5CZKNo7jVJ
@AmazonHelp That takes you to Amazon site, not Amazon Prime Now :( Order isn't listed because it's not an "amazon" order.
@AmazonHelp I thought you were going to link me to a chat. I only see Email Customer Service and Call them.
@AmazonHelp Chat is fine, since it literally hurts to talk right now.
@AmazonHelp Order was refunded and applied to 2nd order, which was missing a whole bag of stuff. Too tired/in pain to deal with making another call right now. I could DM you a phone number to call, however?
Hello friends! Looking for DJ suggestions for the violinist from my wedding quartet. She's getting married, and has specific songs she *needs* played. She's also a music teacher, so a GOOD DJ is preferred ;)
@AmazonHelp PS: I was one of the first people to do your job, except I did it for Comcast. Check out my @shortyawards for customer service. I know good customer service when I see it, and I have been underwhelmed by you folks thus far.
@AmazonHelp The second bag of missing stuff would be nice, since the first shipment arrived two hours after it went missing, and the stuff inside was melted/no longer cold. At this point, I'm so irritated that I don't want your delivery people trying again. Why is this so difficult???
@robini71 @amazon What's really screwed up, is the 2nd time they tried to deliver my whole food order... it actually showed up, minus a bag of cold stuff. Original order magically showed up 10 minutes before 2nd order, with melted ice cream and warm cold stuff. *super sad face*
@AmazonHelp Already spoke w/TWO members of your team. Order was refunded (after much back and forth, which is ridiculous. 1st guy told me I was SOL) and re-entered. 2nd order arrived missing one of three bags. Your link points me to contact page I already utilized.
#FridayFredism	REMEMBER THE CHILD. https://t.co/6vtr2q42kh
An @amazonprimenow update: 2nd order showed up one bag short... and the 1st order finally showed up 5 minutes before the 2nd some how. No address on bags, so I guess 1st delivery person figured out their fuckup? This whole order has been a giant clusterfuck.
So, @amazonprimenow how the fuck am I supposed to eat when my refund won't be processed for 3-5 days? What the hell is the point in getting delivery when your delivery person can't even find an address? I even left directions to get here, just in case they got lost.
Well, @amazonprimenow is a steaming pile of shit. My Whole Foods order was delivered, and is nowhere to be found. That was my dinner, since I only have Amazon giftcards to last until Thursday NEXT WEEK. 3-5 days for refund. Wonderful.
@XPNMembership Just a thought: Do I get a new shirt this year, despite being a sustaining member? I can't use any other part of my membership benefits being in CO, and love rocking my XPN shirts out here!
@xpnmorningshow if I can be a sustaining member all the way out here in Colorado, someone from NJ and DE can too!

@AmberCadabra &lt;3 The more people that know that mental illness is a disability completely out of our control, the more we'll be able to get help. Just finding a therapist was like pulling teeth :( Severe lack of mental healthcare in this country.

@barkway forever and ever. the thing that still kills me is the other cats looking for her :(

@barkway He lead a long, good life! I lost a cat this time two weeks ago :( I feel your pain.
@barkway Sorry you lost a furbaby :(
I have a finch that's so stupid, it keeps pecking the hard clear plastic of the bird feeder, rather than stick its head in the hole to get food out. It did this all day yesterday, and seems to be back for round 2 today. Stupid birb.

@kristenkurtis @xpnmorningshow doesn't Radiohead's Creep have a bit about rain?
@kristenkurtis @xpnmorningshow it would be awesome for a 90's song that's water-themed to memorialize my poor baby cat that passed away the other day. Have poo-brain, can't think of one myself.
Dear @USPSHelp I have escalated this to @RepLoBiondo as the lack of mail for two months is endangering my friend's health and government benefits.
@RepLoBiondo Former constituent from Salem County - Just spoke to Marla on the phone, and she was VERY helpful. Give her a high five from me, and enjoy your retirement when it gets here!
I just learned that @USPS hasn't delivered mail to a disabled friend's place in over TWO MONTHS... and this person isn't alone in their postal woes, either. Atlantic City, GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER. @USPSHelp
@USPSHelp I'm pretty sure it's illegal to not deliver mail to someone's address that is serviceable. Important court documents may have been lost. Friend might lose assistance because of missed mail.
@USPSHelp Disabled friend hasn't had mail delivered in TWO MONTHS. Others in the same complex have same issue. Location Atlantic City. Lack of mail preventing her from getting assistance she need, caseworker confirmed other lack of mail folks.
Was too sad about loss of cat to post yesterday. Some moms look lovingly at their sons on their wedding day. Others, like my mom, thinks she's a T-Rex :P Happy belated Mothers Day to both the moms in this pic. https://t.co/1rjmzvXc8b

Whoopsies! I forgot that having tits means I know nothing about my line of work, and that the guys know everything. Pay no attention to my 15 years of experience or anything. Tits negate ALL of that. *gets more angry*
Hey @FBI and #IRS just got another IRS scam call from 646-396-7490 telling me i'll be arrested within 24 hours *cracks up*
@steveken It went to voicemail, which is the only reason I know what it was. Listening to the VM is ok ;)
@IRSnews I just got a call from 619-730-0199 which was totally a scam. The authorities are going to take me into custody... oh nooooo *laughs* My aunt is an EA, so yeah.. not falling for this shit.
@robini71 when i googled this one, other folks had received calls as recently as 4 hours ago from the same number.
@robini71 This is why I publicly shame them by posting their shitty scam phone numbers (smiles)
Mischievous friends... this number just robocalled me with an IRS scam. Do what you do! 619-730-0199
@steveken STUPID FAILING HDD. That was the cause of much drama in my job for one of my clients yesterday...
@steveken I don't have a "local" library here :/ Amazon has some of them for Prime Video, but you have to buy the bulk of them. I just like old cartoons ;)
@steveken @Nickelodeon I wish someone would bring back the unedited Looney Tunes. Boomerang shows the "politically correct" ones :( And with a disclaimer at the beginning of some of the episodes.
@David_Leavitt Watership Down...
@kristenkurtis YOU GOT TO SLEEP IN!!!! Awesome. Just like this Janelle Monae song :D
@steveken @Nickelodeon I lived through the second half of the 80's... in NJ. Does that count :P I still think we need a classic @Nickelodeon channel, which I emailed their VP of programming about over 8 years ago.
@steveken @Nickelodeon Cmon, you don't love flashing back to childhood? :P I had so much stuff that fit the Memphis Design in the 90's...
Good news, everyone! The old school @Nickelodeon aesthetic is BACK! https://t.co/bUD188MURZ
We need a Church of Mr Rogers or something...  #FridayFeeling #FlashbackFriday https://t.co/ceAwA3lJA8
@wxpnfm you guys should do funky friday in the morning every friday! SO MUCH EASIER TO GET MOVING! :)
@wxpnfm Can I just tell you how excited I was to hear promos for Paul Stankard's glasswork? I used to run into him all the time at the college he went to/my mom worked at :) Have a healthy love of glass as a result!
@robini71 yay!
@robini71 I miss hearing them!
@kristenkurtis @schlindsay She'll be in Denver... just sayin' ;)
@toastido @yoshicool i forgot to add *mic drop* to the end of that last tweet
@toastido @yoshicool I was gonna say, I probably could ;) Exceedingly good at unfucking fucked up internets.
@yoshicool @toastido ‡≤°_‡≤°
@toastido @yoshicool Used to it. Am girl on internet.
@yoshicool @toastido Gross. Too bad I don't work for comcast anymore, or it might stay up. HA!
@toastido @yoshicool There's your problem: I AM THE INTERNET.
@berylmom I have MED here in CO. My first dispensary visit when I moved here was overwhelming! Now, it's just like going to the liquor store... but more apple store-looking and they're WAY more stringent about ID's.
@yoshicool @toastido That's *your* problem now, buddy :P
@jtl999 @yoshicool @Twitter @toastido BRING BACK FAIL WHALE.
@rogersramkoski BLACK MAGIC IS BLACK MAGIC YO. It doesn't come in flavors :P
@yoshicool @Twitter @toastido Throw something soft at his head just to make sure :P
Just so you all have my professional award-winning customer service opinion... @Starbuds303 in Louisville is the *best* dispensary I've been to in my almost 4 years in CO. Helpful and consistent kickass staff + large variety + great quality #420day
@JohnCollins Oh really? It's an interesting place... definitely not Delaware ;)
@yoshicool @Twitter @toastido it's all in your head. @toastido must be cray cray :P
@rogersramkoski This isn't more networking black magic like NSX, is it? :P
@CReppWx I actually exchanged my @CO_Symphony tickets for the Sunday performance because I'm worried about Denver drivers+rain/snow+420+tourists :/ Stay safe out there!
@stephenkallao How exciting! Not. Tax fraud?
I think you need to give your post more hashtags dude #420day #weed #cannabis #colorado #police (i'm avoiding Denver because #tourists) https://t.co/Z067fMm5Gg
@robdehaven Yes! She even thanked the ATC folks :)
If Sully Sullenberger can get a movie about his amazing landing in the Hudson, Tammie Jo Shults deserves one too. She landed a plane on a runway sans one engine, stayed cool as a cucumber the whole time, and personally talked to each passenger as they disembarked.
Bring back Fail Whale. https://t.co/2x1yL5HAuu
@kristenkurtis @xpnmorningshow I will NEVER forget @mymorningjacket playing this at Bonnaroo 04 and the skies opening up during this song. https://t.co/kPAILFgXEe
@kristenkurtis did you try turning it off and on again? LOL
@steveken @Tao_of_Will If you loved the book avoid the movie. It was *so bad* compared to the book. A totally different story.
@fairuse MRIs are seldom fun, and always uncomfortable :/
@stacksmasher LOL thanks :) I needed something that would let me keep my stuff on me, but also not hinder my ability to maneuver around the drum. I have a matching purse, actually!
@Tao_of_Will OH SNAP! :D #badinfluence
@Tao_of_Will There you go :) I'd be happy to have green grass out here to cut. So dry! Soooo not spring yet either. If you can, try to see it IMAX!
@Tao_of_Will ReadyP1 nothing like the book :( Husband and I were very disappointed. Wrinkle is something you should see in theaters just for the SFX. So awesome in that flick! Usually wait for OND now, but some stuff you just have to see in theaters :)
@Tao_of_Will Read the book before the movie, was so pissed at the movie :( Also, where's the VR tie-in promos? Remember The Matrix's online promo site? Miss that stuff.
@Tao_of_Will I am so spoiled by having Alamo Drafthouse out here. Gives me a reason to go to the movies again :) Saw Ready Player One (disappointed) and Wrinkle in Time (Oprah slays it) in last few weeks.
@Tao_of_Will Whenever we get a good storm, it smells strongly of cow shit since the winds start blowing out of Greely's direction :P You see Isle of Dogs yet? A++ would see again
@Tao_of_Will What the heck were you doing in GREELEY? It's like, all cows up there!
@goon29 EVERYTHING HURTS SO GOOD.
I did a workshop with Denver Taiko on Saturday. It's like doing three hours of squats, with plenty of arm workout thrown in. I can barely walk down steps, but it was SO worth it :) (sorry for blurry pic) https://t.co/SrJJgS6T79
@Spiceworks I think I feel special being followed by you. Maybe. It IS Friday the 13th, though. Did you mean to follow me? :P
@fairuse Twas 80 here yesterday, then snowed overnight... open MRI?? i'd need a nap after two MRI's...
Congress is a bunch of our grandparents who are tech-stupid. Try to explain things to them? HA. They don't really care about how shit works...  just yelling about it when something goes wrong, like most of my clients. #ITLife https://t.co/suVFvu9jdN
@fairuse Shhhh I start work at 6am MDT :P
@kristenkurtis Wasn't sure if you were in this for just Gwen or the whole band. Now I know! I instantly thought of you when she announced this on Ellen yesterday &lt;3
@kristenkurtis Your girl is doing a residency in Vegas. Pack your bags! :)
@kristenkurtis LESS THAN FOUR MONTHS! :D :D :D This is also one of my fave Radiohead songs.
@fairuse If someone is able to catch them! A neighbor tried with fishing nets, to no avail. Mom's out getting feed to lure them into a pen.
@DJRobertDrake I want to go back to Japan so bad! Specifically the recovering Tohoku region. I watch nothing but NHK World for the most part (and TCM), and much has changed since I was there in 2008!
Yesterday, my mom woke up to 5 chickens in her yard. Neighborhood posted on FB trying to find owners to no avail. Now they're trying to catch them, without much luck. The Chicken Saga continues... Pretty hen though! https://t.co/RFjPt1RrmR
@kristenkurtis Friday laugh: Yesterday my mom woke up to 5 fancy chickens in her yard/roaming the neighborhood. She and neighbors posted on FB trying to find the owners, but nobody's come forward. Now, she's trying to catch them, and failing hilariously.
@kristenkurtis Girl, I had allergies back home... but out here I don't. Except for Aspen trees. You know, the most prevalent tree in the state? Ugh. #poofyface
@fairuse @FrankEliason I yell profanities at the Comcast Business IVR, and that routes me to a person pretty quickly ;) Like, just screaming the Jay and Silent Bob song :D
@kristenkurtis Don't lie, you know you're doing this Philly stuff because of the awesomeness of Marilyn :)
HOLY FUCK OMG LOL. Maybe his mustache is the secret to his cyber power? Quick, SOMEONE CHOP HIS MUSTACHE OFF! https://t.co/zGyX6IKfV1
The compassionate human in me is appalled by the shooting at YouTube. The sysadmin in me wonders if their DR plan worked out.
@kristenkurtis She's Marilyn from Preston, Marilyn, and Steve right?? Always wondered what happened to her!
Oh hey, Villanova won last night! This means I need to hit up my fave cheesesteak place to celebrate after work :) WTG PHILLY!!!! Bring ALL the championships home :) :)
@blankbaby Oh my, Bunnyman! You look totally different! Is it the fact that you're not wearing a kickass Hawaiian shirt? :P
Awww today eight years ago, I rolled over in bed and said "We should get married" to with my husband said "Yeah??" and I said "Yeah." and we were engaged. Following morning, got a fake ring from the Chinese lady in Suburban Station before work at Comcast.
@DJRobertDrake @LivingColour @Twitter @LateNightSeth Did you fangirl out a little? :)
@xpnmorningshow @DJRobertDrake @kristenkurtis ommmggg this song reminds me of elementary school music class :)
Hmmm, I'm not sure how well that would work out. Don't a good chunk of processors come from China? Didn't Foxconn just buy Belkin/Linksys/Wemo?   https://t.co/UWY5d56SgX #FCC #China #TradeWar #NationalSecurity
@wxpnfm Summertime is one of my fave songs, and I love the endless remixes of it! This Organica remix is pretty awesome :)
Dear asshole: the south is dead, you treasonous traitor. https://t.co/b0zgmKnRzl
@kristenkurtis AHHHHH ONLY FOUR MONTHS UNTIL WE SEE THESE GUYS LIVE AHHHHH!!!! This is also my melancholy song. *high five*
@kristenkurtis We did get 30 minutes of surprise THUNDERSNOW Sunday night. I was watching it rain HARD outside, only to find out from husband that it was *snowing* HUGE flakes, not raining, and lightning/thundering!
@kristenkurtis I was joking, but AWESOME! :D FYI: I think we may have swapped weather? https://t.co/08oRdO13ao
@kristenkurtis OH OH. This is my job! Did you try turning it on and off again? :P
@kristenkurtis snow day brain! :P
We've lost one of the great minds of the ages today. RIP Stephen Hawking :(
@robini71 Working same gig telecommuting to NJ, kiddo situation got complicated with her mom *very big sad face* so we haven't heard or seen her since September.
@robini71 and everything is just fine out here. it's a nice day outside, no clouds, brilliant colorado blue sky, lots of birds *smiles*
@robini71 I always try to give descriptions to pictures I post just for you :) Just because you're awesome in a different way, doesn't mean you can't enjoy bird stuff too!
@robini71 It's about 12 inches tall, has orange-yellow on the tail, is mostly tan with tons of black spots, a black "bib" on it's chest, red streaks that look like blush on its cheeks, and a curved long-ish beak *smiles*
I've been ridiculously excited about a Northern Flicker deciding my bird feeder is a cool place to hang out. Today, it let me take pics! #birds https://t.co/pExonzbIjN
@DJRobertDrake @SEPTA @SEPTA_SOCIAL @SEPTAPHILLY This girl has her priorities straight!
@kristenkurtis glad to hear it! y'all got as much snow as we did last week. it's all melted now, but it was definitely there for a few days, which is way too long for colorado snow to stick around!
@kristenkurtis I hope the storm wasn't too bad for you. You made it in to the studio this morning, so it can't be snowpocalypse bad.
@stephenkallao Dude, I definitely did not wear pants during the last podcast I did. There is no requirement for clothing for podcasts, just sayin. Cats, yes. Clothes, no.
@stephenkallao i went full crazy cat lady and created an instagram account for the cats... merlins.magical.balls is the account. that way, i'll stop sending you cat pics ;) #CatsofXPN https://t.co/9MtQaopC1r
@kristenkurtis no snow here this week. Just stunning sunrises. https://t.co/A7XNOuDvbN
@wxpnfm EVERY. TIME. EVERY TIME this song comes on, I am compelled to adopt more animals, which I can't do because I already have too many rescues in one house! @kristenkurtis
@kristenkurtis how'd you all make out with the STORMY STORM? We got lucky and our -temps went into the 70's yesterday, and finally melted snow from last week!
@theericschuman you have to play "My Heart Will Go On" from Titanic for all us teens of the 90's who saw the movie in theatres 5+ times :)
ROFL. It turns out my issue with @Comcast yesterday was occurring NATIONALLY. Impacted a bunch of my clients. Playing the "THANKS, COMCAST" game apologizing to folks today. Someone jacked up routing, methinks! :x
@TMobile *clink* keep up the great work :)
@TMobile today marks 2 years since we've been pals after I dumped Verizon. No regrets :) &lt;3
China is already working on instituting a national score based upon your social media posts. This reminds me of that concept. Are you being patriotic enough in your posts to warrant being admitted into the country? Hope so, or you're SOL. https://t.co/rF1pbjLXnt
@jtl999 I got a good laugh too ;)
@comcast @comcastcares I used to be @comcastbonnie, yo. I don't need their help. The issue is on your end, and has already been escalated. It's cute you reached out, though :)
Gotta love it when I report an issue to @Comcast and they're like... WAT. Only Comcast connections can't get to a specific site. It's pingable, it can be traced, just won't load the page. IT'S NOT DNS. It's not the site. WHEEEE.
@MrSnarkyPants Merlin has a catchy account name, too. He's only following other cats ;)
I've been in the social media game for a LONG time, and somehow, my cat is more popular on instagram than me! To be fair, he is rather dashing with the looks, and stupid enough to be entertaining.
@xpnmorningshow @wxpnfm This song always reminds me of the end of Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, one of my favorite movies! &lt;3 &lt;3
@DICKS THANK YOU!!!!!!
@blankbaby That is a FANTASTIC shirt!
RT @blankbaby: Why, yes, I am wearing red pants with this shirt. Thank you for asking! https://t.co/0vcjnHlwlt
@kristenkurtis bringing back some memories with Bird and the Bee!!!
So many people told me that Merlin should have his own Instagram account, that I finally made him one. Check out https://t.co/wkeZ8wRKUm for all the cat action :)
Just had a Snow White moment: While putting the bird feeder back on the holder, a chickadee came up and started feasting while the feeder was still in my hand. Neat!
@Big_in_VA yup, but only a short visit. went back in December though :)
@kristenkurtis YAAAAAAS QUEEN! *high five*
@kristenkurtis any luck?
@kristenkurtis Girl, since I got GA and my husband has three herniated discs and has issues standing... perhaps you could come with me? :D
Scored two tix to @radiohead in Philly July 31st!! AHHHHHH!!!!! @kristenkurtis
Desperately trying to see @Radiohead at MSG or Philly in July, going to fly out from Denver. Wish me luck trying to get tickets today! Haven't seem them since Tower Theater gig on 6/1/06!
@kristenkurtis @wxpnfm OMG I HAVE TO FLY HOME FOR RADIOHEAD NOW!!! MY FAAAAAAAVORITE!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I just watched four bald eagles beat the shit out of each other. Kind of feels like they embody America at the moment, fighting amongst themselves.
Dear children in school: I'm sorry we keep failing to keep you safe. Good luck staying alive today!		This is not a tweet I should be making. We've averaged one school shooting every 60 hours this year. Way to go, America. #ThursdayThoughts
@TeamUSA @chloekimsnow PLEASE get @chloekimsnow some ice cream for that AMAZING RUN yesterday!! &lt;3 &lt;3 Or get her somewhere they make that cool ice cream on the spot! Very popular in Asia :)
@DJRobertDrake If this Jersey girl can be a member all the way out here in Colorado, the rest of Jersey has NO EXCUSE! Let's hear the bell ding, folks! @wxpnfm @LeichtLunch
That run by snowboarder Chloe Kim last night was üî•üî•üî•ü•áü•áü•á
I was in Walmart over the weekend, and noticed they sell @HardCandyLife. I remember being HYPED about Hard Candy nail polishes in high school in the late 90's/early 00's, so I checked out the selection, only to find NO NAIL POLISHES! :o My, how times have changed.
Loving @Microsoft and their hiring of autistic folk! I wish I knew that I had a sensory processing disorder earlier in life, and how it would impact my work life. MS is making things a little easier for others, with their badass lady Chief Accessibility Officer.
There should be a Philadelphians climbing things twitter or instagram account. What is it about folks from back home climbing things? :) They're determined, if nothing else!
Of all the streams to watch, @6abc is THE BEST. Just like their newscasts! 	 https://t.co/vNDIitzUoP #EaglesParade #Eagles
@forwardsecrecy I know a few of the beta/alpha testers, they got me an invite last year. Dig it!
@robini71 Everyone always goes on and on about how awful colorado winters are, but I'll take colorado winters over new jersey winters any day!
@robini71 I'm so excited! But pretty bummed I'm stuck way out here! At least it's supposed to be 62 outside here today *big grin*
Who's got a stream of the #EaglesParade? I'm stuck in Colorado :( I know the line at my old train station in Wilmington has people out to the condos snaked around the block! BIG DAY IN PHILLY METRO!!!
@forwardsecrecy I, too, am on Keybase :D
Good Morning! The sun is shining, the world is still revolving, and there's a car in space. What a time to be alive :)
Beautiful launch by @SpaceX of #FalconHeavy this afternoon. Those boosters setting down was like watching a well-choreographed ballet. History is being made!!!
Looks like we are go for 3:45pm EST for #FalconHeavy!!!! https://t.co/59BFVyGRSP for the live stream from @SpaceX
ARE YOU ALL HYPED FOR #FalconHeavy TODAY?! :D
@kristenkurtis Just the way the voice sounds reminded me of late 90's Gwen :) Nobody can ever match her voice ;)
@kristenkurtis this US Girls person sounds a lot like old school Gwen!
I partied with the upper video engineers last night, and it was hilarious watching their reaction when NBC blacked out briefly. Once they figured out (rather quickly) it wasn't them, they went back to fiddling with other gadgets :P
*Wakes up* *sees #phillypolicescanner trending* Damnit, Philly.
Dear Amazon: If I search for Eagles leggings, don't show me shit that won't ship until the end of FEBRUARY. Grrrrr.
@NeilHanlon @digitalocean whomp whomp :/ RIP uptime
@Hysiq I know the feeling, lady.
@AskAtlassian I was worried it was that. It's not really a technical issue, but it's the reason we went with JIRA, and if I can't do the thing I'm trying to do, we have to dump the product (I don't want to do that!!). Ticket submitted.
@askatlassian is there not a number I can call for help with JIRA? Do I have to fill out a form and wait for a callback?
@LeichtLunch Probably focused on the Eagles win last night :) &lt;3 No worries!
@LeichtLunch Hail to the Thief, not Hail to the Chief lol :)
@fannykaplans *waves*
@KyleClark and your hair looked different last night because the lighting in that "studio" is way different from your normal studio. People need to focus on more important things... like their own lives. Or making the world a better place. 2/2
@KyleClark why do people criticize the fuck out of your body? Your hair is fine, your cheeks get red... who cares? They get red when you're passionate about something (green makeup tempers the redness btw). Not cool to criticize women's looks, not acceptable for guys too. 1/2
@kristenkurtis @BettyMWhite I woke up and saw #BettyWhite trending and thought she died... and then saw it was her birthday. Phew! Betty White is what I aspire to be when I'm that age :)
That Google Arts &amp; Culture thing keeps giving me results that are paintings of dudes... Not so sure about this AI.
@MTNzaService Jan 13 at 10:45am Mountain Time, someone from IP 41.113.89.207 tried gaining access to my Steam account. They failed, but I'm reporting it anyway. Thanks!
@nexton9news Just wanted to let you know CO Symphony is the most CHILL orchestral experience I've ever had, and I've been playing cello for 22 years. VERY reasonably priced+alcoholic drinks available. Would love to introduce folks my age to the symphony!

@xpnmorningshow I love Seu Jorge! Like many others, I was introduced to him through "The Life Aquatic", which is one of my fave flix :)
@robdehaven The money spent on the gowns could have been put toward the causes of the amazing activists who were attending last night. Unless they were donated... but they could be auctioned off!
Why are we commenting on dresses women wore to the #goldenglobes and criticizing their choices? Isn't this the opposite of what we should have been doing?
@filmiliarface Madame Curie is one of the most badass STEM rolemodels I had growing up. Loved the flick!
I feel so special that @DJRobertDrake liked my Christmas card enough to send me some @wxpnfm swag :) I hope my ornament has a place in the halls of XPN Christmases to come! https://t.co/IEF7ifOFAe

@filmiliarface well, I'm thankful this year brought us you! I'm alone on Saturdays while husband makes sure millions can see TCM :) You rock all sorts of lonely socks!
@filmiliarface I didn't know Osbourne died until the yearly "who died this year" spot started playing :( *hugs* sadness

@wxpnfm SAD CATS AND DOGS TIME D: @SarahMcLachlan This is a stark contrast from No Doubt's "Oi to the World"
@kristenkurtis I just blasted the bejesus out of that to wake my husband up ;) WTG! Also, this feels wrong with Shawn Colvin singing and not Vince Guaraldi Trio. I remember going to "The Wall" and buying this on CD.
@kristenkurtis you happy you got your No Doubt on? :) &lt;3
Just a disclaimer to cover everyone's butts: I am not an employee of Amtrak, and my views/opinions do not reflect those of my family nor the company. #AmtrakDerailment
@MSUScottW that Cascades derailment D:
More on Cascades train: Same thing happened in Philly. Regulations to put track control system in place nationally pushed back to end of 2018. Lives could have been saved if implemented on time. #AmtrakDerailment
Why the Cascades train derailed: Going 80 in a 30. Previous test engineers said the slowdown at this curve of track was problematic prior to the inaugural run. No track control system in place. Engineer error, or physics fucked everything up. #AmtrakDerailment #DaughterofAmtrak
@xpnmorningshow holy crap is this guy stoned? :D
@xpnmorningshow it's important regulations for legal weed be in place. unauthorized pesticides and mold are a real issue! CO regularly busts growers for this crap. Don't want that in my lungs!

FUCK THE FCC #NetNeutrality
OK so no bomb, let's get on with this show #NetNeutrality https://t.co/n2RSjE3lHj
Did they just evacuate the #NetNeutrality hearing???
Oh, fiber buildouts being prevented by #NetNeutrality @AjitPaiFCC?? How about you hold VERIZON accountable for the billions we gave them for fiber buildouts that NEVER HAPPENED.
Oh, @AjitPaiFCC you should just shut up now. You have no idea what you're talking about. Get a professional up there who knows what they're doing. #NetNeutrality The internet is more than BUSINESSES.
Hey, let's end power utility neutrality and make it so your Apple computer gets full power while your homebuilt box doesn't. #NetNeutrality Internet is a utility and a requirement to participate in the modern world.
@covercash Trying to avoid an incident like my southwest tweet the other day :P
Watch the #NetNeutrality bullshit here: https://t.co/8LOSyhQgxN obligatory fuck @AjitPaiFCC and reminder that the majority of IT-literate folks support net neutrality.
@FCC How about you focus on keeping the net open and neutral for all? I'm the daughter of a firefighter, and this is cool and all, but #NetNeutrality takes priority today.
Look at my pretty drawing of @AjitPaiFCC and the battle for #NetNeutrality https://t.co/1ff28i8Ue5
I triple dog dare @AjitPaiFCC to stick his tongue to a cold flagpole &amp; tell it that his tongue won't get stuck because the flagpole would give his tongue special rights to remove itself quickly compared to other flagpole lickers  #NetNeutrality
@covercash @AjitPaiFCC HACK THE PLANET! #NetNeutrality
Prepare for #NetNeutrality tweets all day. Remember that time Comcast said they weren't throttling P2P traffic, then it took a customer to prove they were? Tech was called Sandvine, and could easily be used again. Fuck @AjitPaiFCC
I have fought for #netneutrality for years now. I have the decision from 2015 hardcopied and bound. If that piece of shit @AjitPaiFCC ruins a good thing, the citizens of the internet will ruin him. I worked for Comcast. They will fuck your shit up if NN is revoked.

@xpnmorningshow glad I flew back to CO last night! It was getting chilly before I left. I got all sorts of excited when @DJRobertDrake posted my card on FB!!! Wait till you open it :)
@CatSkoor @SouthwestAir Perhaps I should have worded that differently... :x
Got here early and caught these @SouthwestAir employees spreading some holiday cheer https://t.co/gbrpOSVHXV
@wxpnfm @somevelvetblog OH, and wait until my card gets there for @DJRobertDrake :D :D
@wxpnfm I think I *have* to make the joke every time I hear it, just because :)
@wxpnfm @somevelvetblog LOL. Nah, I have you guys in the background while I work all day :) Ask @kristenkurtis i'm tweeting at her at 6am my time most days!
@KyleClark There's a weatherguy from my homeland of South Jersey, @chris_sowers at WPVI, who was in a similar situation as you. Carry a whiteboard around, and don't talk. Rest your voice or it WILL get worse. Ask Chris!!!
@wxpnfm Hello from Rocky Mountain High BOULDER COLORADO :D It's Friday too... Totally Rocky Mtn High day!

@stephenkallao our current place (#3 since moving out here) has these veneer things covering the holes under the cabinets in the kitchen/bathrooms. two of the four have figured out how to pop them off and get stuck under the cabinets &gt;:| had to stuff holes full of loud scary plastic stuff.
@DJRobertDrake it's coming! I finished it with a special home made surprise inside :) https://t.co/yJizNDlwdQ
@stephenkallao they do have a very uh... unique meow. our bengal is the loudest cat i've ever owned, and also the smallest
@stephenkallao SIAMESE AND A BLACK DUDE! YAAAAAAAAS! Does your siamese yowl at you affectionately? :)
@stephenkallao moving 1800 miles from south jersey to colorado with two hotels reminded us of that. first night in lexington, bengal and black dude got stuck IN THE HOTEL WALL. had to get broom handle to get them out :x catproofed every room after that.
@stephenkallao He was in a @petsmart adoption center and husband and I said he looked so sad, we had to bring him home. Little did we know, he eats twice as much food as the other cats, LOVES trash, and can pull doorjams out of the wall/carpet off the floor.
@stephenkallao First night in our new place in Colorado, the big black cat got out. There's a fuckton of coyotes outside here, and we were FREAKING OUT. He did too, and hid under the deck all night &gt;_&lt; https://t.co/d6UomANM2Q
@stephenkallao We've only had him about ehhh three months? He's "special". Drools. Delayed reaction time. Loves trash. He hails from Wyoming. https://t.co/q9kv00vzju
@stephenkallao The rest of the gang: there's one very stupid dog too, but not as stupid as the first cat I sent you. Wait for the next pic https://t.co/ftDk7719JV
Oh look! It's Wednesday. Wonder who's going to get in trouble today? https://t.co/HbiyBPUY5E
@stephenkallao i, too, am ruled by cats... four of them. welcome to the xpn partay! https://t.co/hUyOUxj9VS
@DJRobertDrake I have the card, and the stamps (holy shit, I have stamps?)... gotta remember to send it!!!
To the drunk and/or stoned guy singing holiday tunes in the mall parking lot: Happy Holidaze to you too, buddy. #neveradullmoment
@DJRobertDrake what's the addy to send cards to? You'll be getting one from Colorado!
@xpnmorningshow now I have to message mom because Barry Manilow is on :P and having flashblacks of being in a cab on West End going by Copacabana
@McGuckins &lt;3 you guys are so amazing that husband and I deal with driving to Boulder just for you folks (and D'Angelos for cheesesteaks!).
@slak909 i feel like we should exchange cat pics...
@FCC Stop. You and I both know the repeal is complete and utter bullshit that makes the ISP's more money. I should know, I used to work at one. BRING TOM WHEELER BACK.
We are building a RFID cat feeder because newest cat never stops eating. Hoping this works out!! Might need the help of the pro's at @McGuckins
@xpnmorningshow apparently, in the late 90's, we had a lot to be thankful for. &lt;3
@karlbode i'd be much obliged if you could spread this term, much like Santorum had a new meaning during the elections last year.

@kristenkurtis LOVE the new Bjork, but the video... is amazing, and slightly risque. But beautiful.
@covercash I think all of the edibles are stamped with THC on them now. Honestly, I just wanna get home without getting arrested. I'd be so sad if I couldn't eat pork roll because of a tiny amount of illegal shit :(
@covercash Ummmmmm.... good question. Fruity Boulder Hippy foods? :P
I posted on FB asking friends/family if they wanted me to bring stuff from CO home to NJ when I go home next month. Everyone wants weed. Guys, it's still illegal in NJ :( And every federal facility, like airports.
Oh snap, I hit 90k tweets the other day too! Whoaaaaadude.
I don't normally do sportsball (I love Sumo though!),  but I am damned proud of the Eagles for being surprisingly AWESOME for once. Also, I am enjoying seeing Broncos fans eat their words out here. #CelebrateMonday

@xpnmorningshow AHHHH RADIOHEAD COME TO DENVER PLEASE!!! I saw them at the Tower back in 03 or was it 04? I forget :( Amazing show though.
@FishroomSci @USFWS NICE! Though, I wouldn't want to be near a moose...
Hey guys, everything is totally (not) cool in Puerto Rico now, didn't you know? We're pulling our troops out because everything is (totally not) awesome!  https://t.co/inz7aFTLzI
@kristenkurtis ERMAGERD GWEN?!
@xpnmorningshow omg it's SO EARLY. 4am out here. nothing like maintenances off-hours!
@USFWS also, a good friend of my family worked for y'all, went down on Flight 93. Rich Guadagno. He'll never be forgotten. Ever.
@USFWS we actually have an aggressive elk problem in CO. Every year I hear about them attacking police cruisers, in particular. Weird elk. :P
I have "Phish - Run like an antelope" stuck in my head now... Thanks @USFWS :P https://t.co/gCIit4AD4U
@SouthwestAir its name is Pongo, and yeah... I didn't buy a car in high school/college so I could buy this cello. transporting it from NJ to CO has terrified me for the last three years. i need to do it though, because it's my soul.
@bdimcheff @SouthwestAir If you check out @TheStradMag they have tons of reports of musicians transporting delicate instruments, running into all sorts of issues at the airport. Even when a seat has been bought for the instrument.
@bdimcheff @SouthwestAir There are many horror stories of string players bringing their instruments on flights. I need to ensure nothing will happen to this instrument. It is my baby. Other option is to get it home by train.
@SouthwestAir I want to bring my cello to my new home in CO from NJ next month when I fly back with you (I &lt;3 you guys so much). Would paying for an extra seat ensure no shenanigans? Cello is 180 years old. Can't leave it out of my sight.
BEHOLD! Relics from my past employments :) https://t.co/l8kFfgpd9Q
@wxpnfm MIC IS ON!!!
@xpnmorningshow it's horrible! first stop: wawa by the airport for a bunch of stuff (i get in around midnight). then there's one across the street from my hotel! YAY! gonna eat so much bread stuff. and italian. and pizza. mmmmm
@xpnmorningshow coming home in a month!!!! GONNA EAT SO MUCH WAWA AND BREAD OMG. And be able to listen to you over the air :)
@jtl999 It's always a good time for mashed potatoes :D
@comcastcares did they finally give you guys your own space to be loud and not disturb VP's in? :P Looks like it!

@pr1ntf I'm just glad shit works now.
@xpnmorningshow you should see how miserable Broncos fans are out here. So happy to see the Eagles winning for once! :D
Looked up from working on something, and there's this guy. Husband and I named him Pickles. Coyotes are weird. https://t.co/lNjmhExLzB
@xpnmorningshow now I KNOW my neighbors are going to wake up, because I just turned Brubeck up to 100%
@covercash Ehhhhh. If I have to make mac n cheese, I'll spend the 20 minutes making kraft 3 cheese n shells ;)
@covercash I HAVE. There's a costco very close-by, but the elevation makes baking complicated. It takes like, an hour and a half to make :(
@covercash I don't even have that readily available out here :( Gotta make my own... THE HORROR!
@xpnmorningshow *wakes up downstairs neighbors with drum solo*
@MrSnarkyPants sign MOM picked the right hotel :) my teeny tiny town of 7k has TWO wawas. YEAH BOY!
@jonk thankfully, i caught $59 nonstop each way tix on @SouthwestAir (i love them so much!). mom said best present ever! EAT ALL THE WAWA FOOD.
@MrSnarkyPants there's one directly across the street from our hotel :D need some Herr's potato chips too.
@jonk you don't know how much you'll miss it till you don't have it!!!
@covercash Trust me when I say current state Wawa is better than no Wawa at all. Colorado, despite the abundant stoners, has nothing similar to Wawa :(
I'm going home to NJ next month for the first time since 2015. So excited to eat bread, pork roll, and WAWA. And see my family/friends :)

@chasman609 That's kind of how I feel, but why is it always crazy Americans with guns? Not crazy Swiss folks with guns?
@LynCKos Go deeper than an organization. One organization doesn't dictate the motives of all americans. Trying to hit root cause.
I rarely get political here, but I am always looking for solutions to problems. What is the root cause of mass shootings in America?
I don't think this is a gun problem. I think this is an American problem. Other countries have heavy gun ownership, no mass shootings. #ugh

@barkway hey are any of the disability or special needs shelters still open by any chance? still trolling through the broward OEM site.
@barkway Get glass, put against wall. Listen for anything? Something to do, at least :)
@barkway GAH! there's no winning in your situation is there :( happy to keep you sane here however i can, in the meantime.
@barkway @cspanwj Generator AND hot water panel working apparently! I wish I could go down and help you cleanup. Doubt there's any flights near you right now.
Ripping off people and not helping them when they need help the most kills me inside. I wish I could goto FL myself and help cleanup!

@barkway @cspanwj check that link I just sent, call those numbers (or i can for you if you need me to). rick scott was all NO PRICE GOUGING in his pressers..

I need a licensed tree person in Broward County to help these folks out with medical issues!!! Insurance rules mandate licensed treepeople. https://t.co/ZVXD5hju2i
@barkway @cspanwj GOD DAMNIT INSURANCE! Hold on, what county are you in. I'll tweet out an all-hands for you, this is a medical issue.
@barkway @cspanwj And I'd be happy to ship you masks as a bandaid for now, as insignificant as that may be.
@barkway @cspanwj GAH. I have lung issues too. Are any shelters still setup for folks with med needs? Have you tried your county's OEM? I can get # for you.
@barkway @cspanwj Balls. Not the good kind. Is it possible to start getting branches off the main trunk to get that cut up at least? Neighbors w/chainsaw?
@barkway @cspanwj What can I/we do to help? I'm not a corporation anymore, but I still help people.

@Belen_DeLeon girl, this day makes it hard to brain. Alliteration is a bitch on air!
@RodneyU215 Girl, do it! I was never encouraged to enter tech. I am glad I did! You'll have excellent mentors :)

@LeichtLunch need "here comes the sun" today. 9/11 got me crying and running out of tissues remembering lost family.
@DJRobertDrake Saw too much death and destruction up close. Lost family on flight 93. It's hard to human today.
Today, I remember good family friend, Richard Guadagno who was on ill-fated Flight 93 9/11/01 https://t.co/3tYaYZlyoQ
I can't forget. How can you forget the smell of death everywhere. https://t.co/P2FalXWpyt
@DJRobertDrake I don't want to remember.
I can't forget 9/11. I can't forget the smell of that much death. #september11

@jlivingood @jtl999 Thank you, Jason :) Google defaults to v6 when you ask, have to specifically look for v4 lookup. Neat :D
@jtl999 today we learned! WOOHOO!
@jtl999 yeah it's what i think is the nat ip. doesnt show up on router or modem
@gallifreyeve to be fair, i've been having an off week. discovered a hard drive in this laptop i didn't know i had. never bothered to look :x
@jtl999 it seems that way
@gallifreyeve router has no ipv4 (it's enabled), and google is saying my ip is v6 :o
@gallifreyeve I don't get a static IP with my service, unless I pay $30 a month... so maybe this is why? My modem "isn't compatible" with it. Yeah, ok.
@gallifreyeve I had both at first, now I just have one. Biz class too, MB7420
@gallifreyeve Does your modem have an IPv4? We both have similar connections, so yeah. I'm curious!
@covercash Just what I need, drama in the Pacific Rim area :P
@covercash @jlivingood There is *no* other choice. I need bizclass.
I just discovered I no longer have an IPv4 addy assigned to my modem. THE FUTURE IS NOW! @jlivingood

@alamodenver Sounds like some of the people I work with in IT. I am the 11% of the kickass chick IT workforce, bitches!
@richtpt It's in NJ :( Too dry to bring it out here. It's 180 years old, and already been glued back together a few times.
Throwback Thursday is now #FlashbackFriday ? OK. Here's me in like, 11th grade... with RED hair. https://t.co/Dx8SEhrbnJ
@XPNMembership I'm so jealous of the hoodie, still, a year later :P Can't wait for shirt to get here to show CO what good radio is :)
@XPNMembership We should be back from cowboy territory by then with kiddo :) Or I can stream y'all on Tune-in :) &lt;3
@XPNMembership do you know when they go on tonight so I can make sure we're home/listening? Got that two hour time difference...
@waynedixon This is true. I miss old twitter still. I miss the excitement when it became the tool for revolution during the Arab Spring.
@waynedixon I miss the fail whale :(
@anildash To be fair, I'm not a fan of pooping outside my own home either... but I'm also not a narcissistic sociopath.
@lomoon @xpnmorningshow @somevelvetblog @kristenkurtis A small child will be listening with me (she's not mine) and painting nails while you take over. Hello from an XPN member in Colorado :) &lt;3
So, what big thing happened to cause twitter to overload this morning?
@AmyZenunim @Max_Hallam @xychelsea I read well after I tweeted that (over on reddit) she mandated the previous pics. She's gorgeous! Try rocking a coral lippie, love :D
@kristenkurtis this is one of my fave radiohead songs. radiohead is my no doubt ;) also, still snowing here https://t.co/m6BnUSjjhL
God damn, we've made it through this week to Friday! Between the news and the snow... this week has me spent.
@pueblokc lol it keeps melting, but we've had a fuckton of precipitation. the ground is too warm for it to accumulate much.
@pueblokc tell me about it... it hasn't stopped either. It just kind of gets lighter for a bit, then ramps up again.
@pueblokc https://t.co/ZmVHK9kCK7
@pueblokc I'm so fuckin' over it! :P Getting a fuckton up here by Boulder.
@xychelsea Convince the media to use this, please. They're doing you a disservice by using that old picture.
@griffisblessing This isn't nearly as bad as last week: https://t.co/Zds1ad4l5Y last week fucked up calibrated equipment in my apartment.
@kristenkurtis https://t.co/TLcBrJs0IN Chris is the soundtrack to our snow today.
In more positive news, Roger Ailes from FOX NEWS seems to have died.
Turn it up for Chris Cornell and Snow. Fucking snow. https://t.co/TLcBrJs0IN
@xpnmorningshow @kristenkurtis are you trying to make it so i can't make calls through the tears this morning? :( Man... snow, and this.
@kristenkurtis *BIG HUGS* Girl, I can hear it in your voice. We're all grieving with you.
now @xpnmorningshow is playing Chris Cornell singing Ave Maria... the tears man, the tears. @kristenkurtis
Waking up and finding out about Chris Cornell :( :( :( :( Also, it's snowing.
It's old, but I just found out about this account that is literally tweets from a bird. @ir_zilite pretty neat :)
@skulldaisygimp Pretty tired of it lol... though, it's in the 90's back home :x

@barkway also, i lived upper west side manhattan for a bit. i know noise. this is ridiculous when whole apartment is shaking.
@barkway it was never like this until new mgmt co took over, decided to do "improvements" which are making things worse :(

.@cfranklinnews i don't think you understand how reddit works, sir. spamming /r/newjersey + /r/southjersey w/your own articles is bad form.
A very happy 25th to my littlest sister! I remember when she was born... Now I feel old.

@OddKidOut_ also, I am not a fan of Boulder proper. get lots of dirty looks driving around a GAS POWERED car. cyclists give no fucks. good weed tho
@OddKidOut_ I'm a South Jersey girl. If you're ever out here, hit me up. You have a free place to crash (got a guest room, plus I'm a musician too!)
@OddKidOut_ From what I understand, you're a Philly kid right? I'm repping you as a transplant way out here in Boulder/Denver :)
@wxpnfm can't do your broadcast engineer gig, moved to Colorado :( that stuff is my jam, though. i work best when things break :)

@sadserver You just need to relocate to a datacenter in Denver! :)
@Big_in_VA @axs Bug bounties for other sites are at least several hundred to several thousand bucks.
Find bug in checkout process, ask for presale code as bug bounty. No response other than THANKS! from @axs which is LAME.
This needs to be this summer's music anthem: https://t.co/lwB8kgfkDY Bill O'Reilly remixed, and it's amazing.
I am hoping @axs is amazeballs at #greatcustomerservice, working with one of their reps now. Will report my findings! :)
@gorillaz this only applies to entering your password at checkout. you can login to the site fine. the checkout part is the buggy password.
@gorillaz processing vendor for your red rocks show is uh, sheisty at best. fair warning: password cant be longer than 8 and no nonalpha!!
@axs nothing would make me happier to rectify that clusterfuck than a presale code for gorillaz. to be fair, transaction vendor fucked up.
@axs i want to make sure i get gorillaz tix online. should have charged consulting fee for discovering login bug when buying APC tix. 1/2

@Jarime I've wanted to see them since high school. never had the chance to until today.

@steveken i would *love* a solid night of sleep just once in my life.

@fairuse dont you guys need the rain though? we keep getting SNOW. SO MUCH SNOW.

Things the wind did: Blew away doormats/outdoor carpets, broke my water heater and heater, blew the siding off the apartment...
Cause of no heat: Bernoulli Effect. Pressure switch got angry. 90mph+ winds+close to reservoir=water sucked out of pipes.
Also, utility closet door frozen shut/lock seized up. Had to crowbar the shit out of it to get it open for maintenance. &lt;3 them.
Pressure switch flipped, turned off heat. Pressure so bad from 90mph winds, it hurt my ears INDOORS yesterday, so not surprised!!!
@Big_in_VA NJ prepped me for this: got lots of space heaters/heated blankets! maint. can't open heat closet door, must crowbar open!
No heat or hot water this morning. Thanks, 90mph winds! Four other units are without heat too :(

@kristenkurtis you making starting work at 6:30am MST easier &lt;3 *waves from Boulder*
Just gave @wxpnfm some cash all the way from Colorado. It's not even 7am here yet, and I'm giving! #GivingTuesday
@jlivingood so nice of them to drop this the day before turkey day :P https://t.co/fwVO3MRNqv
Dude. What? *sigh* https://t.co/pVZktj5ejH
@rogersramkoski did you leave vmw??? more depressed because orange hitler this year, i think.
Does anyone else get super depressed on their birthday? Saying hello to year 32 in a weird state of mind.
The look on Chichi's face sums up my feelings about today https://t.co/8HE7wgwqi5
BTW giant salmon flew by my window Friday. Thought I was losing my mind. Comm. jets never fly from KBJC! Turned out to be a charter. https://t.co/MsFn0OHHR9
Good Morning! Just saw a bald eagle fly by my window. Hopefully, that's a sign of a good day ahead!!!
@AlaskaAir used to seeing fire tankers and weird custom planes, not commercial jets :) or giant salmon...
@AlaskaAir found out! it's washington football team empty plane! weird seeing giant salmon fly by my window...
@AlaskaAir why did giant salmon plane just take off from KBJC? never see comm. flights out of that airport! live near runway...
A very pink good morning to you all! HAPPY FRIDAY!! https://t.co/CiPizd14oH
@theericschuman oooh perfect song for all this snow falling right now!!! &lt;3
My, what a difference 24 hours makes in Colorado! Top is 4:30pm today, bottom 4:30pm yesterday. #Coloradosnow https://t.co/iTYjeuDG8E
Oh, the Y already reached out to @chemours who wants nothing to do with Salem Co anymore. BAD CORPORATE CITIZENS! SHAME!
Also: it would be a nice gesture to buy the building back, seeing as how you kind of poisoned the fuck out of all of us. #FUSRAP #superfund
Salem Co YMCA was donated to county by Dupont in the 20's. Building used to be used for Chambersworks employees recreation.
Hey Dupont: @ymcasalemcounty, which you donated building for, is up for govt sale. STEP IN. BE A GOOD CORPORATE CITIZEN.
@wxpnfm you're saying Chickory TIP... not Chickory Tit. I seriously thought you were saying the latter until I googled them.
@richtpt just pay a low voltage electrician to do it? :D
@richtpt don't forget: husband used to install this stuff at CC.
@richtpt it's called wallfishing, and it's pretty easy if there's wires already there (like phone lines)
@richtpt cat5 is easy to run, believe it or not :) networking on a small scale is not as scary as it sounds.
@bmayzure i think we could all use a little fire whale with us sometimes. this is in contrast to fail whale, which none of us want to see.
@richtpt anything running over powerlines will have issues unless SUPER NEW wiring :( run cat5? repeaters?
@richtpt right? :(
@richtpt too rich for my blood! glad i didnt buy the lifetime license tho. stopped working after TV9.
@CharterComPR y'all shut town the twc email addys the other day. it's official now :) my husband is a mgr video twc side. ready 4 future? :)
*sigh* I could really use a TeamViewer license.
@DSLReports You know... you reported it, now they'll hop in to action! It should never get to that point, ever.
Remember when @paulboutin wrote that NY Times article with me in it? He's writing about other stuff now: https://t.co/jZZJpF0F39
Day has been busy. I get wonderful emails with weird translations from coworkers sometimes, which sometimes end up like this: https://t.co/R0qDM51yUS
Gwen Ifill died? What? This is very sudden :( I love PBS Newshour and seeing her anchor it has always been a delight.
@add414 I'm so sorry to hear that *hugs*
@jlivingood Mirai botnet is no joke. Security in GENERAL needs to be taken more seriously.
@theericschuman any philly orch pick is good. been listening to dupre playing elgar a lot this week :(
@Shatter242 if you send me the words, i'll make it into an inspirational poop poster or something ;)
@Shatter242 I love it!!!

Rest In Peace, Leonard Cohen. You truly were a master of your art.
@iJustJas sorry, girl :(
@Tao_of_Will every telco in the country has offices here. pretty wild. you know the NCCC person too ;)
46.9% of America did not vote in the election. Almost half. I am incredibly disappointed, but not surprised.
@Tao_of_Will true! i've met SO MANY comcasters out here, too! one from NCCC about to work with husband ;)
@Tao_of_Will aspen don't really have pollen. they have these pod things, unique to them, and i'm allergic to those! CO is weird.
@Tao_of_Will get this: allergic to nothing in CO except ASPEN TREES. and they are EVERYWHERE OMG.
@Tao_of_Will oh, did you dry out in tuscon? i've had such issues adjusting to the 20% humidity every day here.
This is much shorter, and I've also played it. https://t.co/x8NxX0GY4b #cello #grieving #jaquelinedupre
Jaqueline Du Pre did it better, but this is keeping me slightly calm right now: https://t.co/S632ZYeyIz #cello #yoyoma #elgar #grieving
@Tao_of_Will man, when i 1st started at vmware out here, they told me i was "too intense" and to step back a bit. i'm like, WAT?!
@Tao_of_Will husband is manager of twc/charter/spectrum whatever national video content ops (or whatever their name is now) SO COOL
@Tao_of_Will it's very dry! people are uh, interesting. no rush to do anything... which drives me nuts! 1/2
@onezerosix https://t.co/15Y2kDCFYL
@Tao_of_Will I was wondering if you were still alive! &lt;3 Blockbuster/NCCC/Comcast buddies for life! How the hell are ya?
@steveken that's not how you do customer service over twitter lol
I am having issues functioning withing crying this morning. Please try again later.
@jtl999 9 hours of nature weather scenes... a-ok :)
The Weather Channel is the place to be if you'd like to avoid election coverage. Good on ya, Weather Channel. Beautiful scenery!
@CenturyLinkHelp don't have ctl, used to do your job but for Comcast. No offense, but I don't need your assistance.
@thepacketrat @ra6bit All is well now. There were issues with XO too but ehhhh.
GUYS LOOK WHO TWEETED AT ME LOL Y'all are twitter customer service n00bs, CenturyLink. https://t.co/Av0jiqPBYx
@stacksmasher i'm so jealous of NextLight up in Longmont. Gets me all hot and bothered. &lt;3 munibroadband!!!
Welp... didn't expect that tweet to blow up. Howdy to all you new people. I mostly post tech stuff, or rants about Comcast.
@harper i really wish you could have a gif for your profile pic. need those googly eyes spinning!
@harper used to tweet for comcast. don't like stalkerpeople reading more personal/private tweets. friends-only on that SN.
@harper even the people at twitter were impressed with my three-letter SN :) i get a lot of interesting tweets to that one. *high five*
@NicanBun right? L3 to L3 is OK now though. Just L3 to CenturyLink seems to be jacked.
@harper you are one of the few people I know with a twitter account older than my own (@hrm). thanks for the RT i think? :)
@JoeUchill *waves* thanks for the follow cybersecuritybro :) i just have an interest in the topic. also enjoy watching meltdowns.
@stacksmasher @ra6bit surprised it's happening this late in the day. election day in US, expected some CYBERINSANITY. oooh good band name.
The internet is getting very angry again. So much latency and packet loss for Level3 again! 25% packet loss whaaaaat! https://t.co/ldaesPqUtz
My week in a nutshell: Standing at the doors waiting for them to open at doctor's office. They're not auto-doors. Did it TWICE, too :(
@lisaillman thanks for follow. not much in common though. we need to exchange cat pics, since i have three of them :)
Please vote. Pretty please? Don't care who you vote for, just do it. #voted #ElectionDay
@theericschuman also, have you seen the video for that song? it's really REALLY good.
@theericschuman @wxpnfm request: Moby's newest single "Are you lost in the world like me?" VOTE ON TUESDAY!
@SpaethCo I can poke you here too!
Wish I knew what was up with my neck. It hurt so bad when I woke up, I was in tears. I have a pretty high pain tolerance, too. UUUUUUGH
Last political post, promise! Y'all notice that Trump/Pence=TP? You're gonna need it to wipe all that shit off the US if they get elected.
@trekkieb47 i love your follower count this very second
Trump is secretly just a Ferengi that is poorly disguised. That's an insult to Ferengi, though. #MakeRulesofAcquisitionGreatAgain
I'm in the land of hybrids and electric cars. Tell me again why we need another oil pipeline?
@jasonhand you and i should have drinks. you're close, and i used to tweet for the big C ;)
THAT FEEL WHEN YOU'VE SPENT THREE MONTHS ON AN ISSUE AND FINALLY FIND THE ROOT CAUSE https://t.co/imKviE6DPD
@fairuse i just want... sleep.
Time appropriate greetings to you all! Happy Halloween, or Samhain if that's your thang.
@theericschuman it's in the 70's in Boulder... Can you play some Washed Out "It feels alright" from Paracosm? Good day for it.
@theericschuman play the theme from "Ghostwriter" on PBS ;)
@theericschuman it's pronounced JIF DAMNIT!
Good Morning and Happy Friday! I'm still basking in the afterglow of that Tool show Wednesday night. Was row 11 BBB :D SO CLOSE https://t.co/IozFIH8srT
RT @ctg1701: New KSK (pre-production) for when the Root zone key is rolled #DNSSEC https://t.co/qiBqQWwLiI
I finally updated my profile pic. You all probably think I'm tunring goth with the grayscale lipsticks lately. Secret? Always have been one.
@Jarime wellll tix for this show sold out in 15 minutes. that may be why? :P it's my stupid ticket luck that got me these tix
@Jarime https://t.co/0YXkaPIBmP
I saw Tool tonight. It was amazing.
It isn't easy/cheap being an ISP. RIP Google Fiber https://t.co/xKrhzCec3x
@WelcomeToDot need a banana for scale
@richtpt the guys working with me on this migration understand. they were baffled too!
The satisfaction of figuring out an issue after an entire day of poking and prodding servers.... mmmyeahhhhh :D feelsgoodman.jpg
