In all, it's been wild to watch people blindly repeat every little detail leaked from the Chicago Police Department as fact. I'm familiar with @AJGuglielmi because he once had the same PR role (and tactics) in Baltimore. We all deserve better. Jussie is the victim, here, FYI.
And this is a great example of the "reporting" that's been happening re: the leaks from the Chicago PD. When pressed, the reporter brazenly notes that he's just blindly repeating what he's told by the PD: https://t.co/1KPB3ln5lu
Recently, "sources" said that Jussie arrived home with the food he purchased from Subway in his hand as if to suggest that if he had really been attacked he would have immediately thrown away everything he had. C'mon. The attack was close to his condo, not miles away.
First, "sources" said that Jussie kept the rope around his neck to the hospital. Then "sources" later corrected the story to note that Jussie had the rope around his neck when he arrived back to his building when the police arrived. Why did the "sources" lie initially?
Then we learned that a woman in Jussie's condo bldg saw someone outside of the building in the timeframe &amp; reported this to the police. Then "sources" discounted *her* account by saying the description didn't match Jussie's description of the attackers.
Then "sources" said that Jussie couldn't have actually been hurt because he drove himself to the hospital. Later, "sources" cleaned that one up and noted that he was driven to the hospital by a friend *after* the police had interrogated him at his home.
Then "sources" loudly said that there was essentially no video of anything. But at the same time the "sources" said that, the police *had video* of Jussie in Subway, walking down the street, and had various other footage -- again, this was quietly reported.
Then "sources" said that Jussie didn't call 911 for 40 mins after the attack. Why don't we have the timestamps from the 911 call(s) yet? It is my understanding that the call was made immediately but that it took police 40 mins *to arrive*.
Then "sources" said that Jussie's ribs were broken, but neither the hospital nor Jussie's team ever said that his ribs were broken. But the "sources" made Jussie out to be a liar when he never said that in the first place. 3/
It was reported that "sources" w/in the Chicago PD said that Jussie refused to release his phone records. Then they quietly noted that he *never* refused to the phone records. He denied giving them his *phone.* They don't need his phone to access his phone records. 2/
THREAD. Why is the Chicago Police Department intentionally spreading misinformation about #JussieSmollett? Even if I didn't know him, I'd be concerned just about the way information has "leaked" via "sources" within the Chicago PD to reporters. And it's been since day one. 1/

@ismat I think we are saying the same thing. I was just noting that a FICO score is a distinct asset *and* that it is an input too ‚Äî as you wrote, re: Equifax FICO.
@nsilverberg In the end, we were saying the *exact* same thing but I guess it was easier to make a thread to get RTs. A FICO score can stand alone because it is proprietary *and* it is used as an input in the credit bureaus like Equifax.
@nsilverberg And I wasn‚Äôt saying that it *wasn‚Äôt* based off of a credit report but that there is a distinct asset called a FICO score.
@nsilverberg I hate that this is what Twitter becomes. I was literally talking in my DMs with *another* woman expert who was an advocate and who I‚Äôve been discussing this issue with which is how I was responding.
