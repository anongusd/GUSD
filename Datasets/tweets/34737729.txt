Wasserman Schultz: Would @realDonaldTrump collude with a foreign power to win the presidency? Cohen: Yes
Chair Cummings has skipped order over to Debbie Wasserman Schultz - who was chair of the DNC during the #Wikileaks email dump and ended up losing her position there over the controversy
"I did not want to work at the White House...I was extremely proud to be the personal lawyer of @realDonaldTrump," Cohen says in response to a Jim Jordan line of questioning alleging he's trashing his former employer over sour grapes
Ranking member Jordan using a line of questioning calling Cohen's personal credibility into question - citing his fake Twitter accounts, failure to pay taxes and taxi medallions scandal.
Committee Republicans began @MichaelCohen212 hearing asking for a postponement on these grounds https://t.co/831p5xmbDB
"Nothing went on in Trump world - especially having to do with the campaign - without Trump knowing," @MichaelCohen212 says of @DonaldJTrumpJr Trump Tower meeting

"For the record, #individual1 is President @realDonaldTrump," @MichaelCohen212 tells House Oversight Committee
Cohen says he hopes his testimony today is part of his steps on the path to redemption and apologizes for protecting @POTUS in his previous Hill appearance.
"You have stacked the deck against the truth," Oversight ranking member @Jim_Jordan says of Democrats' restrictions on questions to Cohen. Jordan alleges the president's former lawyer is "their patsy today."
"The days of protecting @potus are over. Over," says Oversight Chair Cummings ahead of @MichaelCohen212 testimony
Cummings says Cohen's history of lying to Congress is "an important factor we need to weigh" but says the need for the American people to hear from the president's former lawyer outweighs that concern
"This new evidence raises a host of troubling legal and ethical concerns about the presidents actions in the White House and before," Oversight Chair Cummings says of check Cohen will show Trump allegedly wrote to pay off Stormy Daniels

My guess is @wmata counts my 2-stop trip as "on time." I bailed @ Woodley Park because train was holding to see if we wld make 9:30 cutoff window before they shut down track. Rather than wait to be offloaded, I left - is that their definition of success? @unsuckdcmetro https://t.co/qT7jiUDJJ3

(3/3) Finally made it to the Orange/Blue line to get to work on Capitol Hill. Of course, I had to pay for a full fare again. An hour and 45 minutes later, I was at work. Oh and btw, the Metro app said Red Line trains were running on time. @unsuckdcmetro
(2/3) Went two stops before train was held at Woodley. Operator could not say if train would go thru Farragut so I got off and waited for L2 bus - three went by too full to pick up passengers. At 9:30, I shared an Uber with a stranger for $9 to get downtown @unsuckdcmetro
