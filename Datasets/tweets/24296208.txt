The 5th of my 5 reasons for leaving Twitter is how much time Twitter consumes. For almost 10 years I have been spending several hours per day reading tweets, retweeting tweets, and tweeting. I read only one book in 2018, and that was an audiobook. Just drop off the key, Lee.
Best Metro Areas for STEM Professionals 	Greater Austin #4 	https://t.co/eSMwyvqWE7
State of the Union is good.  https://t.co/GrHQNOIxeF
My 4th reason out of 5 for leaving Twitter is that the management of the company apparently leans left and is not reluctant to apply its biases to filtering our followers and tweets. Hop on the bus, Gus. You don't need to discuss much. Just get yourself free.
@MikeHowton See, we‚Äôve been on Twitter too long. There was nothing scary about your kind tweet.
There remain 3 more reasons of my 5 for leaving Twitter. This reason is the unhappiness caused by the toxic outrage, snark, and puss that Twitter delivers each morning before breakfast. Sets angry frame of mind for rest of the day. Can live without it. Make a new plan, Stan.
@NRO @VDHanson Didn‚Äôt seem to trouble Comey.

More good news from the Texas startup ecosystem: Austin‚Äôs Seismos has announced $10.5 million equity investment led by Houston‚Äôs Quantum Energy Partners.  https://t.co/ZNJSPoigFK
The second of my reasons for leaving Twitter is that my addiction often has me rudely ignoring actual human beings in the same room, including family, and adorable dogs, too. You don‚Äôt need to be coy, Roy, just get yourself free.
Am tweeting reasons I'll be leaving Twitter. One reason, not my biggest reason, is the regret I have for a few tweets I've tweeted. Several more reasons to come, ending with the big one, then after almost ten years, I'm leaving Twitter. Out the back, Jack.

Internet patents vs standards? In 1980s, before IEEE would consider making Ethernet a standard, Xerox had to agree to license my Ethernet patent to any supplier for a nominal charge. This policy worked out famously. 5G standards bodies should adopt a similar policy. https://t.co/8nhlOspX1t
