@TrumpOrBust2020 @rockynickydog Somebody needs to test these barbaric state abortion laws in the SCOTUS.  I don't think they're constitutional.
@KamalaHarris Medicare for all would lead to lower quality healthcare, especially for senior citizens, doctor shortages, and long wait times.
@KamalaHarris Medicare currently has an unfunded liability of $29.3T.  In short, Medicare is broke.  Saying you're going to institute Medicare for all are nice words, but they're just that, words...in short, pandering.
@KamalaHarris And, don't say you'll tax the rich to pay for it.  You could confiscate all of the personal wealth in this country and you would only have around $2T. You still need another $1.2T just for the first year!
@KamalaHarris Where are you going to get the extra $3.2T to add to the annual budget?  That is almost double the current budget.  And, that's just an estimate, remember that originally Medicare ended up costing 10 times what was estimated.

@SenJeffMerkley It's constitutional and legal...get over it.
@phishinthegorge @iameuru @amyklobuchar Yep, more fried brain cells. I support the best president since Reagan, President Donald J. Trump.  And, he will be president until 2014, so get used to it, doper.
@phishinthegorge @iameuru @amyklobuchar Me neither, pal. Have some more of that weed and fry some more brain cells.
@SenJeffMerkley Bullshit.

@phishinthegorge @iameuru @amyklobuchar I can see it has fried a few brain cells.

@ewarren I don't support liars and fake indians.
@tedlieu Stick it.
@PattyMurray Bullshit. You Democrats don't care about American lives and safety, but Trump does care.
@ewarren Go down there and visit the border and then try to tell us there is no emergency. Stop the hypocrisy and lying.
@KamalaHarris I don't support hussy's who sleep their way to the top.
@RepAdamSchiff Fund the wall and stop the hypocrisy and bullshit!
@amyklobuchar Trump is already working on that.
@AdamSchiff Yeah, we can always expect nothing good from Democrats...thanks for confirming that.

@RepSwalwell I hope you get 20 feet of it.
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Sure, since you are in liberalville.  Who else would elect a radical leftist like you?  Where I live it would be the same numbers, except in support for Trump.

@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Get a life...dildo.
@RightHookUSA @TheBeaSmith And, there will be plenty of them if he becomes president.
@SenWhitehouse You'll believe anything Senator, especially if it's a negative about Trump.  NY Times prints garbage...never reveals it's anonymous sources...but what the hay, you don't care.  For you Democrats it's the accusation that counts, the hell with any real evidence.
@BernieSanders I hope you get the nomination because it will be fun watching Trump mop the floor with you.  Sadly though, you won't get the nomination...too old, and you're a white male.
@AOC Democrats destroy American Democracy...Trump is trying to save it, you little twit.  Oh, and your paragraph on socialism is pure horseshit.
@gspatton007 @Rainbow_Whisper They'll grow up to be Democrats.
@TheJuanWilliams I like how Pavlich and Gutfeld packed it up your Marxist backside last night on The Five.  You're no match for either, they see right through your skewed polls, lies, distortions and warped opinions.

@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump DOA in the Senate, and rightly so.
@RepJeffries Definitely was treason. I guess Democrats are the only one's duly elected?  Stop the hypocrisy and bullshit.
@SenBlumenthal So?  Since when has the rule of law stopped a Democrat, especially Obama and the Obama Administration?  Most corrupt president and administration in history!

@brianstelter He staged the hoax.
@KamalaHarris Thanks for the demonstration of why you should never be president.  You, and your radical leftist pal's, do not care about American lives or safety, but Trump does care. "Waste of taxpayer resources???"  What about the billions that illegal aliens cost the taxpayer??
@IlhanMN You're a criminal and you should be deported.
@PattyMurray NOT unprecedented &amp; definitely NOT un-American abuse of power, Trump took action to protect American lives and safety.  It's lawful and constitutional.  He had no choice because you radical leftists do not care about American lives and safety. You even kill defenseless babies.
@SenFeinstein Your bill is DOA!  Enforce current laws!

@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Good use of money to PROTECT AMERICAN LIVES, something you Democrats care little about.  The more people killed by illegals the better for you Democrats.  The more drugs, and sex traffickers, the better for you Democrats.  BTW, do you receive bribes from the Cartels?

@brianstelter Oh, now the fake news networks are going to carry one of Trump's speeches. I'll watch it on Fox News without the leftist spin.
@Michael89919442 Thank you...appreciate it.
@ChrisMurphyCT Bring it on.
@SenWhitehouse @senatemajldr I hope those hornets sting the crap out of you and your Marxist pals. I for one am looking forward to this!!  If it's in the Washington Post it's crap.
@RepCummings Well, if you radical leftists would do your job and respect American lives and safety, Trump wouldn't have to take this constitutional action.  But, no, you radical leftists would rather play politics.
@brianstelter Blah,blah,blah...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn...CNN fake news
@RepAdamSchiff Constitutional and legal...shut up.
@LarrySchweikart @Tea_Party_Chris @TheHourNews He will need it handed to him because he doesn't have the fire in the belly.
@SenBlumenthal Constitutional and legal...shut up.
@AnaCabrera @brianstelter Doesn't stand a chance.
@GovBillWeld You don't stand a chance against Trump, pal...quit while you're ahead. I sure as hell wouldn't vote for you.
@brianstelter And, the media is not biased left...yeah, right.  All you spew is leftist opinions and fake news.  CNN being the worst.
@brianstelter The right's new talking point???  It is s coup and it's still ongoing by the deep state and radical leftists.  Wake up baldy.
@GovBillWeld Don't waste your time and money running against Trump in the primaries, you'll lose...trust me.
@seanhannity @frednicols1329 Good.

@SenatorMenendez Probably not, but they can be used to protect American people from tyranny, tyranny that would come from the Democrats goal of destroying capitalism and instituting radical socialism/communism. The Democrats goal is to disarm all Americans.

@cspan @SenatorLeahy @senatemajldr This is NOT good news, it's a cave by the Republicans.
@AOC @Lawrence zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn
@KenDilanianNBC @Lawrence WTF?  So, you leftists are going to manufacture some?  What a stupid comment.
Kamala’s claims about pot, Tupac and Snoop go up in smoke.		Like Hillary, just another leftist liar.		https://t.co/90qAoaCey3
@4YrsToday @Tomhoyt6 55% Trump haters.
@RepSwalwell @HouseDemocrats @realDonaldTrump What a crock of leftist psychobabble and just plain bullshit.
@senatemajldr Once again the Republicans cave...sigh.
@SenSanders @SenWhitehouse Typical leftist bullshit...it never ends.
@THEHermanCain No. Force a CR.  Wait for when the sequester (what Obama instituted) kicks in (in September) and start sequestering money from Democrat social programs...they'll come to the table.
@SenGillibrand Conservative women voices yes, Democrat women voices no. Which makes a big no for you, you couldn't lead horse to water.
@SenSchumer That so-called bipartisan proposal is a sham!  I encourage President Trump to veto that sham of an agreement.
@tedlieu Here is the truth Ted old boy. https://t.co/ycvzgQBrpq
@Bud_Doggin @JimKlunk Somebody send this to Ted lieu.
@ZeeInTheMoment @patann0438 @stripedbanana3 @DavyCro50709303 I'd go for that.
@ZeeInTheMoment @stripedbanana3 @DavyCro50709303 You got that right! Total rip off. Some courses have a book requirement, but then never use or refer to the book...I've had a few of those classes.
@stripedbanana3 @ZeeInTheMoment @DavyCro50709303 And, many of their $$$ are spent on liberal causes and leftist candidates.
@stripedbanana3 @ZeeInTheMoment @DavyCro50709303 That's all any tax break is.
@AOC Central to your campaign...destruction of capitalism.
@Ilhan @GovTimWalz @LtGovFlanagan No it's not...build the pipeline!
@ZeeInTheMoment @stripedbanana3 @DavyCro50709303 Personally, I am for a flat tax...15-20% flat rate for everyone.
@AOC Yep, get them evil old corporations...destroy capitalism...central to your campaign.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump That's a lie...your speciality. I haven't heard any truth out of your dumb ass Marxist mouth yet.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Liar.
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @Tea_Party_Chris @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I encourage President Trump to veto the agreement.  Republicans once again cave.
@ZeeInTheMoment @stripedbanana3 @DavyCro50709303 I don't have a problem with a tax break, just not paying zero taxes. There are some tax breaks given already. https://t.co/eWw9iQ9VrN
@SerendipityDizl @HLAurora63 Right on.  Many liberals think this way.
@gatewaypundit @stanley59217007 I'd wager it was a setup.
@stripedbanana3 @DavyCro50709303 When colleges see that you're going to get a tax break for tuition, they will simply take advantage of it and raise tuition. The colleges need to be investigated, and their tax status changed.
@RealSaavedra @Melishous Why am I not surprised?

@petluvers4Trump @Jamierodr10 @IsraelUSAforevr @TXHurricaneRed @DonnaWR8 @jjauthor @Education4Libs @RealDrGina @ReneeCarrollAZ @TheTrumpLady @DaRealGrizzle Keep it up.
@PattyMurray Stop screwing them then, and secure the border! Fund the wall! Idiot!
@ZeeInTheMoment @stripedbanana3 @DavyCro50709303 Disagree with the tax break. My daughter and son both have bachelor degrees, and they both got their degrees on their own without running up huge student loan debt, or any help from their parents.  I got a BBA and a MBA on my own without running up student loan debt.
@stripedbanana3 @DavyCro50709303 This would be a socialistic approach. A college degree is not aright.
@TheBeaSmith @nypost Is AZ going to vote stupid again?
@brianstelter Who cares.
@SenJeffMerkley You, and your Communist Party USA comrades (aka Democrats) are the ones playing politics with peoples lives.  Stop the bullshit, you lefists could care less about the American people.  You're phonier than a three dollar bill, pal.
@janschakowsky @NewsMassCentral @RepRobinKelly @SpeakerPelosi You're not fighting for the people, you're out to destroy capitalism and the American way of life...socialists and Marxists in that group, no real Americans.
@ewarren No change necessary, Trump is doing a great job...turned this country around after 8 years of destruction by Obama and YOUR party.  Democrats destroy. Democrats divide.

@JacobAWohl @Alperian2020 Rest assured, very few Democrats are.
@Roosterman82 @DavyCro50709303 No, I'd vote for Pence.

@RepSwalwell @NewYorker Good description of you wacko leftists. No interest in improving and saving American lives, only GET TRUMP, and the hell with everything else.
@brianstelter Maybe you should stop reporting fake news then, some people get upset about that.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump 110% total bullshit. You don't have a clue about the military, just like you're clueless about the border. You appear to have only one job, and it's not representing the people of your district, it's to get Trump...and you're even a failure at that.

@AOC @RepSarbanes HR1 is a bad bill.  Vote no.  And, it's unconstitutional.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Executive time for Trump is constructive time, executive time for you is laying around playing with yourself.
@RepJeffries And, where are you getting that trillion $ from? And, you're going to bail out all those leftist states, that blew all their boom times / rainy day funds on social programs? Fund the wall!
@amyklobuchar @GStephanopoulos Simple, it's about fake science and lies.
@SenSanders zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn....bullshit
@SenGillibrand You're wrong period.
@Danielle682013 @teresa_zita @JeanneLoberg @robjh1 @shadesome Independent?  You're not an Independent, you're a leftist!  If you can't figure out how much damage that lazy incompetent corrupt Marxist duo did to this country I feel sorry for you.  BTW, go do some REAL research on Moochelle...she's a lazy ass racist.
@SenKamalaHarris So, smart government, according to you, is allowing into CA more drugs, more MS-13 gang members, more sex trafficers, more criminals, and more infectious deseases?  America doesn't need a president who thinks like this.
@amyklobuchar Who will do your housework and dishes; Chief of Staff, Sec of Defense, Sec of State? Which one will pick up your dry cleaning?
@PattyMurray blah,blah,blah...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn
@RepSwalwell Oh bullshit!  Stop the hypocrisy and bullshit...liar.
@PattyMurray Not surprised...haven't seen a good vote for America come from you yet.
@RMConservative And, so is Newsome of CA.
@tedlieu @RepGraceMeng @RepHoulahan @RepDarrenSoto @RepThompson And, total destruction of capitalism and the American way of life...the good communist that you are.

@amyklobuchar @realDonaldTrump False science is on your side, there is NO emperical evidence of man made climate change.  Climate change is nothing more than a ploy by you radical Democrats to destroy capitalism and the American way of life.

@Aprilj33858822 @RepAdamSchiff Well, you know what they say about opinions, they're like assholes, everyone has one.  Trump is exactly what this country needed after the complete disaster of the last 8 years of the Kenyan born corrupt Marxist Obama.  Nailed it.

@RepAdamSchiff When are you going to be investigated?  You're the corrupt one, not Trump.
@RepJeffries A lot of bullshit here, but then you're a Democrat.
@ewarren Another loser...sigh.
@ewarren Oh stop the BS!
@ewarren More dreams are possible now than they ever will be with a socialist like you as president.  Democrats destroy. Democrats divide.
@ewarren Aaaahhhhh, the old leftist wish list. Plotting the destruction of capitalism and replacing with communism.
@RepAdamSchiff @RepJayapal You should be investigated for your meeting with Simpson in Aspen.  You're the one hiding something.
@RepSwalwell @RepMarkTakano This president has done far more for vets than you Marxists EVER WILL! You hypocrites cut the military and benefits every chance you get. So, don't give me that crap.
@tedlieu @KSAmofaEN @AdelAljubeir @realDonaldTrump Oh stop the bullshit, you're getting boring and stupid.
@ewarren Yeah, right....who cares?
@KamalaHarris And, how are you going to pay for it?  Grocery prices are high enough now without you Marxists raising them even more.  You leftists always promise more than you can provide...or, intend to provide (big difference).
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Bullshit!  The majority of the jobs createdby the Marxist Obama were temp jobs and low paying service jobs, not good paying manufacturing jobs.  Get your facts straight...oops, I forgot that you're just the typical lying Democrat.
@KamalaHarris Well,if you Marxist twits would fund the wall and beef up border security there wouldn't be any separated children to worry about!  Of course, being the hypocrite that you are, you had no problem with this policy under Obama?!
@ewarren @joekennedy What? Trump never stole nothing,pal. Trump didn't create division, division created Trump.  Warren has never created anything of substance in her life...except she's a damn good liar.
@ewarren @joekennedy Blah, blah, blah...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn
@ewarren @joekennedy Wrong...Donald J. Trump!
@ewarren @EdMarkey zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn
@Im_Workin @Tony19542 Yep, Shep and Juan. Mike Wallace a close third.  And, Marie Harf.
@swissfamily6 @Tony19542 Can't stand the guy...he's the reason the 'mute' button was added to remotes.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump At least we get a tax refund if you Marxist Democrats had your way there would be no refunds, and we would owe more!  Stop the bullshit and hypocrisy!
@Thomas1774Paine Yes, and your car, your lawn mower (hell,even the grass), your bar-b-que, your washing machine and dryer, your furnance, your stove, your refrigerator, your TV, etc, etc. But the one's in power will still have their airplanes, cars, etc.
@ewarren @wutrain zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn
@BledsoeChuck @Tea_Party_Chris @gatewaypundit George Soros and Oprah are behind him.
@Jim_Jordan @letsrollamerica I would love to debate a leftist on solar power.  I live off grid and use solar as power. It's not what they think.
@Jim_Jordan @remi3457 @AdamSchiff Why isn't Schiff being investigated?
@joekennedy @ewarren @EdMarkey @RepLoriTrahan Who cares?
@ewarren BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! Lies a lot too.
@RepAOC @SenMarkey Hilarious document!  BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!
@ewarren Being the liar that you are, you should fit right in with the rest of the socialists running.
@ewarren @danrivera01843 Destroying America one socialist Democrat candidate at a time.  You'll stick it  to working families just like you Democrats always do.  You promise one thing and do the opposite. Your open borders policy will increase illegal immigration, increase crime, etc, etc.
@ewarren @danrivera01843 Lawrence Mayor is an idiot.  Or, a Marxist.
@ewarren @danrivera01843 Just what we need, another left-wing liar...sigh.
@MAJMO50 @caskett2014 @Bmw2163Heart You're so right!  There is no such thing as a peaceful Muslim...just read the Quran.
2020 Dems jumped to back AOC’s Green New Deal – despite private jet use, racking up air miles		https://t.co/arE3DLJwXX
@Dvscott81Scott Shirley Jackson Lee, same Representative who thought the astronauts planted a flag on Mars.
@Truthseeker126 Trump's rally will be much larger, more enthusastic, but the leftist media will cover Master Beto's and try to spin it as larger...just sayin'.
@ewarren zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn
@DrDannielle AOC's apartment?
@DonaldJTrumpJr @stanley59217007 Because they're all anti-American...Marxists.
@WayneDupreeShow @CCM1956 Yeah, he fooled a lot of us.
@TheCVRP I'd NEVER own an electric car!  I'll keep my gas guzzling pick-up, and the wife her SUV.
@Trumpist2 @smalltownandrew You just now figured that out?
@robjh1 @DwightCooper16 He's a leftist, just like his brother. I stopped watching him a long time ago.  There arn't many shows left to watch on Fox News...Tucker, Hannity, Ingram, and The Five on occasion (preferrably when Juan is on vacation) that's about it.
@AOC The GOP doesn't give a rat's rear about you...you're the gift that keeps on giving.  Keep up the radical ideas. You're a nothing...a media creation.
@ewarren Having another beer?  Quiting the race? Resigning from the Senate?  Attending an indian pow wow?
@SenGillibrand I've got more important things to do, like picking up my one-armed grandmother at the airport with two suitcases.
@HLAurora63 @LolaFor_Trump If it wasn't  for the biased left-wing media, we would have never heard of this Marxist twit.
@RepJeffries @letgobestill In your Marxist dreams, pal.
@CoryBooker zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn
@RepAdamSchiff Best SOTU speech ever...you didn't notice the CBS and CNN polls, huh? You must be part of the 24%...not surprising.
@RepAdamSchiff The planet would be saved if we could get rid of Democrats.  The hot air and methane you leftists spew is creating climate change.
@TrumpOrBust2020 @ReneeCarrollAZ @ActingWhitaker @JacksonLeeTX18 She may be the most ignorant of these leftist twits. When visiting JPL she asked if the Mars Rover would be able to show "the flag the astronauts planted there".  She complained that hurricane names were too "lilly white" and suggested names like “Keisha, Jamal and Deshawn".
@ewarren Welcome to the cadre of losers.
@buzzman888 @HLAurora63 @CoryBooker OMG the world's coming to an end...run for the hills.  This may be the biggest bunch of absolute morons to ever run for president.
@JoeyDoyle100 @Airbornex82nd Quack, quack.....
@ACTBrigitte @V23_nedm Yep, this last election should be a wake up call to all Americans.
@stephphilip8 @Jenn198523 Oh, and I don't care what the leftists, the chickenshit RINOs, and the swamp rats say, this liar was born in Mombasa Kenya, not Hawaii.
@stephphilip8 @Jenn198523 Obama, worst president in U.S. history.  This man did so much damage to this country that it may be impossible to recover from.  The most inept and corrupt president ever.  As CinC, he was incompetent and a coward. He deserves the title as the biggest divider, not Trump.
@RashidaTlaib One socialist twit tweeting another socialist twit.
@RepSwalwell Acting AG Whitaker owned you socialist twits on the Judiciary Committee yesterday. It was beautiful to watch.
@Airbornex82nd @Tea_Party_Chris She should be deported, she broke immigration laws!  She married her brother in order to obtain a green card...illegal...not to mention immoral.
Zoning Makes the Green New Deal Impossible.		A bad idea is made worse by its inability to grapple with local land use restrictions.		https://t.co/Nk19nd3FRY

@PattyMurray And, families across America are sick of you Democrats killing babies.  Fund the wall, and no shutdown...see how simple that was.
@SenBlumenthal We never had any rights until Trump, and his nominations, came along!  The right president at the right time.
@RepJeffries Rep. Jeffries, who are you, where did you come from and how the heck did you get elected to the House?
@Tips_Of_Love @brianstelter Yep, I'm pretty mature.
@Tips_Of_Love @brianstelter Are you gay?
That Was Quick!… Ocasio-Cortez Pulls Her Lunatic Green New Deal Plan from Her Webpage.	https://t.co/r6GFDwu0KK
@Tips_Of_Love @brianstelter I'm really enjoying it too.
@harrisonjaime @ChrisMurphyCT No.
@thebradfordfile @Tea_Party_Chris Always has been.
@Tips_Of_Love @brianstelter If it takes two men two hours to pack a canoe uphill backwards, how many pancakes does it take to cover a log cabin?
@Tips_Of_Love @brianstelter What things?
@Tips_Of_Love @brianstelter Know what?
@PattyMurray Yeah, you and your leftist cronies have ruined the state of WA.
@RMConservative The Democrats don't care.
@Tips_Of_Love @BerkeleyGirl63 @brianstelter Why is there air?
@SenBlumenthal For once I agree with you.
@KamalaHarris It's communism plain and simple. Nice to know that you support communism.
@ewarren Yeah, we could waste it on feel good social programs...yeah right.
@DemRedistrict @EricHolder Fair maps IAW what Democrats think is fair maps...yeah, right. If Holder has anything to do with it, it's corrupt.
@colliertimothy8 Good analogy.
@BerkeleyGirl63 @Tips_Of_Love @brianstelter More bullshit
@Tips_Of_Love @brianstelter Total bullshit
@SenWarren Repeal Roe vs Wade, to protect babies from you murderers.
@brianstelter @evanperez @KaraScannell Who cares?
@PattyMurray Barr will be confirmed, get over it.
@tedlieu So?
@CoryBooker And,154 years ago the Democrats created the KKK.
@brianstelter Tough shit...suck it up, fake news.
@ErnestLamonica @stangplt51 Hilarious!

@ChrisCoons @SenatorShaheen @lisamurkowski @NitaLowey Blah,blah,blah...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn
@SenSchumer No they didn't.  Baby killer!
@ewarren Good man...confirm him.
@KamalaHarris It's all about destroying capitalism...in short communism.
@SenatorDurbin @RepDebDingell He was a flaming leftist.
@PattyMurray Roe vs Wade needs to be overturned to keep you leftists from murdering babies!

@AOC Says a lot about the intelligence level of these Democrat presidential candidates...a bunch of mental midgets.
@AOC pffftttttttttttttttttttttt
@amyklobuchar I'd rather watch snow melt.
@PattyMurray @leahegriffin Hmmmm...you support these, but killing babies is okay...hypocrite.
@ewarren I'd rather watch snow melt.
@CoryBooker Climate change caused by man is a hoax.  Wake up.
@SenWhitehouse @SenAlexander @davidcicilline You mean the infrastructure the leftists let deteriorate as they wasted their rainy day funds (from economic booms) on social programs? How much of this new money will be wasted the same way?
@Airbornex82nd She needs to be deported, she broke immigration laws!
@TedLieuPAC @Based_Right @AOCpress I'd rather watch snow melt. She is an idiot.
@RealSaavedra @AreYouManEnoug2 I'm in trouble!!!!!!
@donlemon @RogerCaynor You don't have any integrity, pal.
@RepJeffries @HouseJudiciary Respect this house of socialist twits? Nah, continue the dog and pony show, that's all you deserve.
@SenatorLeahy @amyklobuchar @SenatorEnzi No, keep the embargo.
@ewarren Quiting?  You should.
@brianschatz Healthcare is not a right, nor is a college degree!  Climate change is a hoax. BTW, you're a socialist.
@MarkSteynOnline @TheriotChristy I was ROTFLMAO watching you on Tucker Carlson last night...the fratulence skit was hilarious.
@AdamSchiff You're a corrupt political hack and a   liar.
@PattyMurray More leftist bullshit.
@KamalaHarris It's complete destruction of capitalism! It is IMPOSSIBLE to obtain 100% clean renewable energy!  Candidates AS IGNORANT as you have no business running for office.  I'll even debate you on renewable energy as I live on solar, I happen to live off grid!
@SenFeinstein He was a flaming leftist.
@tedlieu Good.
@tedlieu Good. Not scared, just don't like meaningless witch hunts.
@RepJerryNadler @RepDougCollins Stop the bullshit.
@AdamSchiff You are a political hack, and you're a liar.
@RepSwalwell @HouseGOP @HouseJudiciary @realDonaldTrump Stop the witch hunt! Keep up the overreach, see ya on the street in two years.
@RepSwalwell Flaming leftist. A midget.
@AOC Increase funding to ICE, they're needed to protect America from people like you and the other socialist twits in the House.
@SenBlumenthal Baby killer!
@BorderNarcotics @sart48 Start with Obama and Holder.
@michaeljohns @Mrs_Malindo @AOC Hell, if you like living then @AOC and the new wave of Dem #socialists are not for you!
@RepDanCrenshaw @MsAvaArmstrong Too bad the clueless Ted Lieu didn't accompany you. Keep up the excellent work.
@realDonaldTrump @colliertimothy8 @thehill He needs to be investigated by the Senate.
@MrSnakeLA @FiIibuster He is the right president at the right time...someone (can't remember who) on Twitter summed it up best by saying 'Trump didn't create division, division created Trump.'
@jko410 @LaylaAlisha11 M-O-R-O-N.
@PattyMurray Don't even equate yourself to 'Henry ‘Scoop’ Jackson' you couldn't walk in his shoes.  Scoop Jackson would be considered a Republican by today's standards, you're still a radical leftist who condones killing babies.
@RashidaTlaib @AOC zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn
@colliertimothy8 I've been saying this for years.  FDR prolonged the Depression.
@mjs_DC Good.  No loss.
@Dvscott81Scott My bad.
@Lrihendry It's far worse than socialism, it's communism.
@4uConservatives @magnusson_kyle It's far more than socialism, it's the total destruction of capitalism and the restriction of movement of people...in short communism.  The Democrats have finally played their hand in what they're really after for the future of America...or what's left of it.
@spweber54 @AOC WTF?
@donlemon That'll be the day you EVER ask a leftist (Democrat) a tough question.  You're phonier than a three dollar bill, pal.
@CoryBooker But America won't be proud of.
@Airbornex82nd @LaylaAlisha11 @AOC @POTUS Yesterday I was pissed, but after sleeping on it I have realized the blessing this really is.  2020 should be an interesting election...go GOP, we have a chance...go Democrats, America is finished...it's that simple.
@ArizonaKayte @AOC She doesn't realize how much she exposed herself as a blooming idiot.  I believe in private even Pelosi is laughing her butt off.
@DoingRight1 My answer is 'yes' at first, until they wake up and find out how ridiculous it is and how they're playing into Trump's hand. I hope they never wake up.
@Boyd_2650 @HLAurora63 @RepAdamSchiff @POTUS The Senate needs to investigate Adam Schiff.
@Tweets4MAGA @HLAurora63 This Green Deal is all about destroying capitalism and restricting the movement of people.  In short, communism.
@Redtowel4 @AOC Pull my finger.
@SenGillibrand The solution is to get rid of Democrats who kill babies!  Democrat Party: The Party Of Death.
@cs00582scs @KamalaHarris @AOC @EdMarkey No, no, we need those twits to stay on that Green deal band wagon.  If they do, Trump will eat them alive in any debate.  I'm afraid they will wake up and realize the stupid mistake they just made.
@RepJerryNadler @Tea_Party_Chris So? Whoop-de-do.
@Patrici15767099 @letgobestill I just threw out my bananas and peanut butter.  S-T-U-P-I-D.
@colliertimothy8 It was good.
@ArizonaKayte @AOC @buzzman888 @RuthieRedSox @ReneeCarrollAZ @KAG4All @lilbulli1031 @LadyRedWave @Jamierodr10 @megdogwuff @Patriot_Mom_17 @HLAurora63 I think you're right on. At first I was livid about it until I saw how insane it is, and then four of the twits running for 2020 jumped on the Green Deal bandwagon and the light bulb went off.  We conservatives need those twits to stay on that bandwagon...Trump will own them.
@SenJeffMerkley On your CNN interview, when attempting to define socialism,you said "Well, it is a society coming together to increase the standard of living of our seniors, and that is pretty much the definition. And the president's attacking it." You're an idiot.
@AdamSchiff He's not terrified of congressional oversight, he's just not happy about ridiculous partisan witch hunts, i.e., your investigations (out of revenge).  What we need is an investigation of you, and your meeting with Glenn Simpson, which would not be a witch hunt.
@SenWhitehouse @ChrisMurphyCT Stop smoking whatever you're smoking, you're hallucinating.
@DailyCaller @AlisQ45 Our enemies are laughing their ass off, not only about this insane plan, but the American people being stupid enough to elect these twits.  We're doomed.
@hughhewitt There's only one trap door? The whole plan is insane!
@NevadaJack2 @Phishie_Philly John Roberts, Bush's Sandra Day O'Connor...we need one more conservative.
@silver_fox9 @nypost Real rats or politicians...hard to tell them apart.
@SocialismStench @Lrihendry It is so insane I really don't know how one can put a cost in $$$ on it!  $2T, I believe is a way low ball number, it has to be much larger than that.
@RepAdamSchiff We now know that you met w/Fusion GPS head honcho Glenn Simpson in Aspen.  So, what was discussed?  You need to be investigated.
@Ilhan @BigErnie2020 Who cares what an immigration law breaker thinks, or says?  You should be deported.
@Hank63R @usminority @AOC Run!  I'll even donate to your campaign.
@Rbigzs @TMURPH88 @heyitsCarolyn @nancy_hamm1 @RL9631 @mymynags @LisaNiebs @sherry25793049 @silver_fox9 @DeplrbleRzistr @Cdeeman123 @ShawnG927 Not one true American among them...all Marxists.
If ICE had more funding and manpower maybe they would have stopped some of these new Marxist twits in the House from coming in, or remaining in the country. https://t.co/MO2Af1UjMj
@brianstelter From you, probably fake news.
Roberts joins Supreme Court's liberal wing in blocking Louisiana abortion law.		Bush's Sandra Day O'Connor.  We need one more conservative.		https://t.co/XZR2VMCzSj
@IlhanMN @AOC You should be deported for breaking immigration laws, and she should be committed to an institution because she is mentally unbalanced. Fund ICE, they do good work.
@KamalaHarris Especially leftist teachers who cram propaganda into little heads full of mush. Oakland is the arm pit of the west coast.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump You would sure sound more credible if you ever really toured the border and saw what it's like.  But, hey, that would take some real effort on your part, and it would open your eyes some, which you don't want.  So, stay ignorant.
@USProgressives @RashidaTlaib @HouseDemocrats Yep, raise them wages...watch the job losses, and the prices go up.
@EvadRules @mollyday15 They're trying to.
@speakrofhouse @DanCovfefe1 Sure glad I didn't have coffee in my mouth when this came up!
@speakrofhouse @DanCovfefe1 Whoa!
@AdamSchiff More leftist bullshit...sigh.  Political hack.
@SenSchumer Barr will be the next AG, get over it.
Message to the voters who elected these new Marxist twits in the House (and Senate) that wrote and support this New Green Deal...I just want to say thanks assholes.
@Public_Citizen @AOC It's absolutely insane, but then it is written and presented by Marxist's who are out to destroy capitalism...this would do it.  But having said that, it ain't NEVER gonna happen...period.
@Ilhan Ain't going to happen, so get over it.
@Ilhan No we don't! It would be the end of America...it's absolutely insane!
@SenKamalaHarris @RepLucyMcBath But, you won't listen to Rep Scalise...so, I will ignore this one.  What do you bet the incident happened in a city run by Democrats?
@SenJeffMerkley How in the hell did you ever get elected?  I never knew there were that many Marxists and idiots in Oregon.  Anyone, with a microgram of grey matter between the ears knows your (and the idiot AOC) Green Deal is absolutely insane.  Pssst...it ain't never gonna happen, pal.
@KamalaHarris Blah, blah,blah....zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn...more leftist bullshit...yawn.
@CoryBooker The next AG will be Barr.
@Ilhan And, you should be deported for breaking immigration laws.
@SenFeinstein Blah,blah, blah...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn.
@ewarren pffftttttttttttt!!!
@SenSchumer Doesn't surprise me, you never vote for the good of America anyway.
@RepSwalwell @HouseDemocrats @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP And, where is the results? No bill out of this Marxist House is going to ever become law, pal.
@CoryBooker Figures.  You never vote in the interests of America anyway.
@SpeakerPelosi zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....yawn
@SenBlumenthal Keep it private.
@SenFeinstein Good.
@RepSwalwell Another really intelligent comment from a moron...sigh.
@ewarren Quitting, eh?
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @DHSgov And, I'm calling for your resignation, if nothing else, for being an idiot.
@SenKamalaHarris BULLSHIT! IT'S A HOAX!
@SenBlumenthal @LindseyGrahamSC @SenFeinstein Oh stop it. You're blowing smoke.
@IlhanMN Trump will mop the floor with him...period.
@SenGillibrand @AOC @SenMarkey And, it's ABSOLUTELY INSANE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@SenatorDurbin @PostOpinions No wall, no deal.
@KamalaHarris @AOC @EdMarkey Thank you, thank you...for jumping on that insane Green Deal band wagon. If by the small chance you are the Democrat nominee, Trump will mop the floor with you, because that Green Deal is absolutely INSANE! And, it's NEVER NEVER going to happen!
@PattyMurray You Democrats have destroyed Washington State.
@SenFeinstein Confirm Barr.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Stop the hpocrisy and bullshit!
@SenKamalaHarris But, you had no problem with the nomination and confirmation of Kagen, who had less experience than any of Trump's nominees. Stop the hypocrisy!
@tedlieu @MattWhitaker46 Nothing.
@RepAdamSchiff Climate change is a hoax!!!!! That Green Deal ain't gonna happen, pal...you heard it from me first. If that Marxist utopian plan was ever initiated this country would make Venezuela look like the garden of Eden. INSANE!
@pearly2004 @RepAdamSchiff @NRA The goal is national gun registration, then put that in a data base.  Now they will know who has the guns and then the next step is confiscation.  Vote no on HR8.
@AdamSchiff You are a political hack!
@ChrisCoons @CardinalDolan Donate your pay.
@BReaganite @pearly2004 Nah, not just yet, I want to see the other Marxist Democrat candidates chew her up...it's gonna be fun to watch.
@mattgaetz @Maxineskrazy Yep.  Vote no on the gun confiscation act HR8.
@Tomuchinfo4you2 @adjunctprofessr @GloriaProphet @POTUS The REAL assault weapon.
@bill_medic142 @LaylaAlisha11 Yeah, I saw a bunch of them sitting on the Democrat side during the SOTU speech.
@SpeakerPelosi There is NO climate crisis!  Besides, how you going to do anything about it, short of destroying the economy, some how control the sun? If you really were interested in protecting God's creation you would stop killing babies.
@SenFeinstein Confirm Barr, and keep the report private.
@SpeakerPelosi @HouseDemocrats FUND THE WALL!
@PattyMurray THEN SECURE THE BORDER AND FUND THE WALL, YOU TWIT!
@tedlieu @HouseJudiciary No, not scared, just voting against a witch hunt which you leftists are known for.
@SenWarren @RepAOC @SenMarkey Climate change is a hoax...shame on you.
@tedlieu @MattWhitaker46 @HouseJudiciary What a crock of leftist crap.  How about you telling the truth just once, eh?
@SenGillibrand I don't trust your solution, but I do believe something should be done about this industry.
@ChrisCoons zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn...we can always count on your anti-American vote.
@RightHookUSA @sart48 She should be deported, she broke immigration laws!
@SenatorDurbin Of course, America can always depend on you for your lousy destructive votes.
@SenKamalaHarris You know, you leftist morons spout off how the middle class keeps getting screwed in this country, and you propose garbage like this!!!!  These solutions would lose jobs , increase prices, and increase taxes, and screw the middle class even more!
@AdamSchiff You are a political hack, of the worst kind!
@HillaryClinton zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn
@Ilhan @AOC @AyannaPressley @RashidaTlaib You should be deported.
@ChadPergram Surprise, surprise.
@RepCummings What?
@HLAurora63 @gailsline The faces of evil.
@RepAdamSchiff @NRA You mean the gun confiscation act HR8.  Bad bill, and it will go down in flames., if not in the communist-run House, the Senate.
@SebGorka Yes!
@AdamSchiff You are a political hack.  You're NOT doing your job, you're just harrassing the president. How about we investigate you? Dirty little secret is you just want his tax returns just to demonize his write-offs.  Has nothing to do with justice.
@SenGillibrand Where do you get this crap from?
@PattyMurray Oh shut up, your solution is socialized medicine paid by the taxpayers...leading to lower quality healthcare, longer lines, doctor shorages, and killing off babies, the weak, and the old. Democrat Party: the Party of Death.
@SenatorLeahy Require a valid ID to vote, and only get to vote once.  Return voting to just one day only and must show up in person.  Anything else is just rift with voter fraud, which your party maximizes.
@bigleaguepol @LovToRideMyTrek I find her credible...what say you Democrats?
@RealJamesWoods @MC_Mad_Man Cheering for themselves and the downfall of capitalism.
@consrvatvebammr @HLAurora63 Because they're communists!  They're out to destroy capitalism.
@RepSwalwell Why are you afraid to allow Rep. Steve Scalise to speak at your gun confiscation House Judiciary meeting?  Huh?  Afraid he may expose your fraud?
@WayneDupreeShow Too much fat between the ears.
@WayneDupreeShow @LovToRideMyTrek Probably, only because he is a Democrat.
@TWPundit @LovToRideMyTrek Lock him up!
@RepSwalwell @mattgaetz Nah, he was correct the first time.  You are lying when you say you're only interested in confiscating guns from criminals. Vote NO on the gun confiscation bill HR8!
@DLoesch @DwightCooper16 Valentine's Day cards are now sexual harrassment?????  Yikes.
@Acosta More Acosta fake news.
@RepMarkMeadows @DragonHutch58 It's just harrassment.  They're still pouting over the 2016 election.  And, by God, if they can't find anything they'll manufacture something.
@SenatorDurbin @NewDayCNN Confirm Barr and fund the wall.
@KatzOnEarth @brianstelter That's just a small part...pay attention.
@SenJackyRosen Sure glad I moved out of Nevada when I did, after seeing all the Marxists elected in that state during this last election.  Now, watch the state self destruct, especially when the next housing bust occurs, which won't be far off.  Oh, and load up Yucca Mt.
@jadler1969 @hughhewitt Good point.
@brianstelter @mathewi @BrendanNyhan Not over hyped...you do it almost daily.  And, your network is not known as the 'fake news network' for nothing, pal.
During the SOTU speech, as I looked at all the old career type politicians, on both sides of the aisle, I said to the wife 'we really do need term limits.'  As for group in white, that is the biggest bunch of communists I've seen since a photo of the Kremlin I saw recently.
@SenGillibrand If it's written and submitted by a Democrat no wonder he hasn't signed it. Because, no doubt, it will be full of socialist goodies that have nothing to do with family leave.
@Maggieb1B @kjune65 @POTUS Or his communist ideals.
@RepMarkMeadows @FiIibuster Schiff should be investigated for his sexual molestations.  We know he did it at least once, and paid the guy off. If he has done it once, he has done it several times. He has only been caught once, and tried to cover that up.
Oh hell yes...not even close! https://t.co/IHoW9DAR50
@TheJuanWilliams Watched more of your Trump hating vitriol on the Five last night.  Still inaccurate, but then I have never heard anything but lies, hypocrisy, and such hatred come from your lying lips anyway. It's starting to get really boring, because that's all you got, pal.
@RepTedDeutch @AMarch4OurLives And, millions more say NO to HR8.  It is NOT common sense legislation, it's just another leftist ruse to confiscate guns...period.
@realDonaldTrump @Lima20Alpha It's an effort to get a hold of your tax returns, probably all the way back to when you were born.  And, even though you have passed IRS audits, they will make your write-offs look evil and illegal.  We really should be investigating Schiff and all his sexual molestations.
@BuckSexton Good point.  It is also telling that the Democrats now all of a sudden, since it's their own, believe in due process...hmmmm.
@Jillibean557 @silver_fox9 Because they're Democrats...the Party of Death.
@LazyMeatball The new KKK
@LazyMeatball Destroying America one socialist / Muslim Democrat candidate at a time.
@KamalaHarris And, where are those water crises? In cities run by Democrats!
@PattyMurray zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn
@colliertimothy8 Good one.
@PattyMurray Shut up! You're full of crap.
@colliertimothy8 I wear a MAGA hat, camoflage version, and have had no problems.  And, I legally conceal carry.  My state has a right to carry law.
@ewarren It was Obama who created this student loan mess.  Why don't you go after the colleges who keep raising their tuition!
@SenKamalaHarris @staceyabrams She was a joke.
@RepJerryNadler @HouseJudiciary Then start doing some action in the cities that have the gun violence, the vast majority are run by you Democrats!  With the strictest gun laws no less! Of course, being Democrats, you will punish the majority because of the few.
@AOC I'm sure you made an ass out of yourself.
@SenCortezMasto @NevadaCurrent @ENERGY Ship more plutonium to Yucca Mountain NV, that's a good place for it.
@FLOTUS @mr65gibson Good job.
@LadyRedWave @1Romans58 It's her bitch clap.
@BillKristol And, I hope it's a year before we see another tweet from you.  Freakin' RINO.
@TWPundit @IFBpaul Lock the bastard up!
@SenBlumenthal Yeah, right, blah, blah, blah...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn.
@Ilhan Sure glad I don't live in your communist state.  The people in that state better get prepared to pay some huge utility bills...just sayin'.
@RepSwalwell No removal of assault weapons BECAUSE you leftists have mislabeled and misidentified what a REAL assault weapon is.  You leftists are clueless, and dangerous!
@IlhanMN @RashidaTlaib Both of these twits should be deported.
@RashidaTlaib Trump owned you, Democrats, last night!  It was a beautiful sight!
@amyklobuchar Don't tell me you're going to run for president? Sigh...
@ReElectNydia @LaylaAlisha11 @thecjpearson @AOC Be afraid of you???!!! BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!  You freakin' Marist!
@KamalaHarris Nope.I don't support Marxists.
@GovMLG You're a disgrace!
@PattyMurray You're confused, you just described Stacy Abrams rebuttal speech...and, I will agree that speech was like that. Trump's speech was uplifting, positive, and exhilarating.
@KamalaHarris Pure bullshit. That's not what you really stand for.
@nytclimate @SenWhitehouse Bullshit.
@SenKamalaHarris Perfect candidate.
@LisaMei62 @lovewrenching36 Good summation.
@TheJuanWilliams @jonfavs Pure bullshit!
@BamaJeans24 Right on!
@SenAlexander @POTUS And, that's it?
@Trump45_USA1st @cs00582scs He's also an admitted communist.
@PattyMurray This ain't going anywhere!  Destroying America one disastrous bill at a time...pathetic.
@BIZPACReview @LovToRideMyTrek Why didn't you leave then?
@Ilhan BS!
@BoSnerdley Pretty soon they're going to be down to Jake (the janitor).
@KamalaHarris Yeah, new leadership in THE HOUSE!
@KamalaHarris @staceyabrams Only another Marxist would enjoy that terrible rebuttal...full of inaccuracies and lies...presented by a poor loser and tax cheat.
@Ilhan @EdLaborCmte zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn
@BoSnerdley @nypost Most little spoiled brats don't apologize.
@HouseJudiciary @RepJerryNadler blah, blah, blah...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn
@SenFeinstein zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....yawn
@HillaryClinton @staceyabrams But, walls keep out the illegal ones...dumbkoff.  They also keep out drugs, MS-13, terrorists, sex trafficers, sexual predators, criminals, etc., you know those types that you leftist Democrats want more of in this country.
@ReElectNydia @LovToRideMyTrek @thecjpearson @AOC Be afraid of a Marxist? Nah I don't think so...just keep up the radical leftist BS and you'll be out on the street in two years.
@colliertimothy8 Damn it!  Why didn't I think of doing that last night?
@cwpinc @colliertimothy8 Yes!  Please!
@HillaryClinton @georgetownsfs Thanks for the warning.
Suggestion to Twitter, put a button next to 'like' and label it 'pfftttt.'
@SpeakerPelosi @HouseJudiciary Didn't need to. All those violent cities were run by Democrats.
@_ROB_29 @RedPillBlackMan BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! Good comparison!
@jojoh888 @darhar981 Cute.
@catzz1402 @EinsteinMaga @DoingRight1 @JulieReichwein1 @SURGDissection @John_R_Berna @CuriousHobbyist @Nick_Clamorgan @Bigbillshater @MagaGoldHat @karen_erotoo1 @Arauz2012 @AugustSandmeier @BlueEyedTweetie Love those old westerns.
@IlhanMN May you be deported.
@SenGillibrand zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn
@THETXEMBASSY @baalter I like that term 'Democrat Jihad Caucus' very fitting.
@realhublife @lloyd4man Whoa!
@NAschenbre7 @FairyQ15 I watched...typical leftist BS laced with inaccuracies and lies.
@KamalaHarris Total bullshit.
@BreitbartNews @LovToRideMyTrek Communists!
@Roger96203916 @SenSchumer @staceyabrams Excellent comment.
@tedlieu Should be good comedy.
@SenWhitehouse You have to laugh to keep from crying reading your absolute ignorant tweets!  You Marxist pukes can't destroy this country fast enough!
@SpeakerPelosi You were so disrepectful last night during the SOTU speech...your usual bitchy demeanor was definitely on display for the whole country to see. BTW, how many drinks did you have before?
@RepSwalwell @HouseJudiciary @AMarch4OurLives @GiffordsCourage You gonna get rid of the Democrats who run those violent cities, and don't do anything about it? "No more silence. We're taking action"... a stupid bravado statement, give me a break.
@colliertimothy8 If she didn't look petty and ridiculous.
@RepJerryNadler @HouseJudiciary Yeah, violence that has been destroying our 'Democrat run' communities.  This is what happens when you elect Democrats.
@PattyMurray Did you fall asleep during the speech?  Because this is an ignorant tweet.
@RennaW @DjLots3 Yup.  About time this came out.
@SenSchumer @staceyabrams BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!  Thanks for the laugh Chucky...pssst, she was terrible.
@tedlieu Why would we want to join you Marxists?  But, hey, don't change a thing you're currently doing...see ya on the street in two years, pal.
@Sniper64286433 @darhar981 She doesn't even know.
@BillOReilly @dlf730 BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
@BoSnerdley Whoa!  How is she gonna handle that?  That's a campaign death sentence.
@RepMaxineWaters Just to let you know, I didn't take your advice.  I watched the SOTU last night, and it was great!  The best I've seen...too bad you missed it.
@mitchellvii @KatherineWolfr2 Stupid, and full inaccuracies and lies.
@Roger96203916 @AOC No, she wore white to honor the KKK.
@brianstelter They're going out of business?  They print fake news? What's the big announcement?
@PattyMurray Fund the wall then!  See, that wasn't so hard.
@brianstelter There aren't that many ignorant people out there...oops, I forgot about Democrats.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Grow up will ya! You sound more like a juvenile every tweet. Stupid, uneducated, pentulant little boy.
@RealMattCouch Oh yes.
@madisonc_morris @Tea_Party_Chris Creeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeepy.
@Aliciastarr001 @cheri4trump Yeah, she's completely unhinged. I had to unfollow her.
@KamalaHarris BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!  Thanks for the laugh.
@SenWhitehouse What an absolute crock of crap!  Medicare for all will bankrupt this country....oops I forgot, that is exactly what you are really after, the destruction of the American economy.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Such an ass you are. Pathetic.
@LisaMei62 @RonJWalters She was purposely trying to distract the viewer, take one's eyes off the POTUS and on her, that's the bitch she is.
@Ilhan Watched the SOTUS last night, and it was great...best I've watched.  The rebuttal, was terrible, which was no surprise.
@TeaBoots @cheri4trump Such a petulant little child.
@BoSnerdley Go ahead, and get beat again.
@emilyslist @CoryBooker Worst rebuttal in history.  She's a loser!  And, a sore one!
@CoryBooker  "Again, this is a president whose rhetoric is often vicious, cruel. Here he talked a lot about World War II, but he couldn't even condemn Nazis when they were marching in Virginia???" You really said that bullshit?  You'll never be POTUS.
@SenSchumer Hey Chucky boy; POLL STUNNERS: Both CBS and CNN Polls: 76 Percent of Viewers Approve President Trump’s State of the Union Speech; CBS: 72 Percent Approve His Immigration Ideas.
@TheJuanWilliams Watching the pre-SOTU show on Fox News last night, thank God for the mute button on the remote every time your mug came on the screen.  Because I knew what was going to come out of that leftist mouth, just more Juan bullshit.
@charliekirk11 @Tea_Party_Chris She's got alot of growing up to do yet.  She's just a petulant little girl.
@RealSaavedra @mljackson12 Spoken as the admitted communist he is.  Of course he didn't like it.
@JerryFalwellJr @remi3457 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Yes!
@Dougs1978 @AD_WHITMAN @BreitbartNews Heels up Harris, bad for America.
@Trump454545 @kjune65 And, squirm she did.
Secure the border! https://t.co/tG0R20VPUN
@Trump454545 @kjune65 All dressed in straight jackets.
@Rainbow_Whisper @HLAurora63 Definitely creepy.
@RealJamesWoods @mljackson12 No wonder Giuilliani called him putzhead back when they were running against each other for Senator.
Both CBS and CNN Polls: 76 Percent of Viewers Approve President Trump’s State of the Union Speech; CBS: 72 Percent Approve His Immigration Ideas.		https://t.co/d4ZxlnGFtW
@Jenn198523 @robjh1 It was priceless! And, Bernie will never be president.
@AOC You were an embarassment...petty, juvenile, small....grow up.  Someday, when you reach puberty and understand how great this country really is, you just might understand just how great that speech and this president is. Grow up.
@IlhanMN Yeah, right...keep trying to convince yourselves. Why do Democrats always lie?
@SenatorLeahy Democrats NEVER save taxpayers dollars...who you trying to kid?
@Ilhan zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn
@SenGillibrand @staceyabrams @AGBecerra Adams is a loser.
@SenFeinstein Confirm her now...any regulation you authored is bad.
@tedlieu @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi Tonight when the cameras show the House Floor during the #StateOfTheUnion, the American people will see the most corrupt and leftist Congress in US history. 		And as the cameras focus in on @POTUS, sitting behind him looking down at him will be the drunk Pelosi.
@RealMattCouch I'm sure he doesn't want to shake hers...touche.
@Bobwadejr2 @LNW4Trump Racist idiot.
@colliertimothy8 Should drop all charges. If found guilty, I hope Trump pardons him.
@SenJeffMerkley A new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll shows Hispanic-Latino approval of President Donald Trump’s job performance jumped 19 points in the past month, hitting, hitting 50% in January.		Hispanics want LEGAL immigration and a wall!
@dbongino @TheriotChristy I wanna see10 years of Pelosi's tax returns.
@KamalaHarris @staceyabrams She's a loser...eats good too.
@KB55554 Disagree, it was a defense masterpiece by Bilichick. Excellent game.
@DavidRutz @FreeBeacon @KamalaHarris Everything that comes out of her mouth is so incredulous and stupid that I crack up too.

@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Talk about diarrhea of the mouth, you have it, pal.
@IlhanMN @Jamiemlong @NickAFrentz Climate change is a hoax, and a propaganda tool for the left in their relentless quest to destroy America.
@RepAdamSchiff But,hey you were fine when the incompetent corrupt coward Obama showed up in the Oval Office around 9:30 am, hung around an hour or two then headed to the golf course.  BTW, Trump is a whole lot smarter than you, pal.
@RepCummings @JoeNBC And, the Lt. Gov should leave also.
@colliertimothy8 I meant to tell you that my son is a retired (25 years) Las Vegas Metro police officer, and former marine.
@RealSaavedra @colliertimothy8 The only time he opens his mouth is to change feet.
@ewarren @ReElectCummings If a Democrat is writing / submitting the bill we're gonna get screwed.
@colliertimothy8 Yep.  Loved those home comings!
@JoeNBC Shut up.
@KamalaHarris Not interested.
@PattyMurray Blah, blah, blah...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn
@RealJamesWoods @CoolHandLuke001 She does do a good job.
@Markdunlop1 @KamalaHarris If this was true, which it isn't, zero $$$ is a compromise?  FU.
@Markdunlop1 @KamalaHarris That's a myth, pal.
@Markdunlop1 @KamalaHarris Bullshit.
@IDF @colliertimothy8 Cool.
@Unite4Truth @KAG4All @MaxineWaters @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats @TomFitton Lock her up!
@dbongino @jenniforlyn Mine will be on loud and clear.
@IlhanMN Leave shaping America alone, it is doing just fine...NO SHARIA LAW IN AMERICA, get that through your skull.
@IlhanMN @RashidaTlaib But, you're a Muslim woman, which is a second class citizen in your stupid culture.
@RepJerryNadler @HudsonRiverPark I wouldn't visit, or spend a nickel in that corrupt state.
@SenSchumer Ahem...Trump approval rating at 48%; way far above yours, pal.
@SenSchumer Like you give a rat's rear about unity...hypocrite.
@dcexaminer @JamesFBuckley2 @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump That's because we FINALLY have a real FLOTUS.
@brianstelter @DLind What a freakin' moron you are baldy.
@tedlieu @PMorici1 @AOC A whole lot smarter.
@tedlieu @PMorici1 @AOC And,  @PMorici1 is a whole lot smater. Oh, and Happy Lunar New Year...dumb shit.
@DrShayPhD @LovToRideMyTrek Sorry for your loss.
Hey Democrats what do you think about this?		Former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke Endorses Democrat Candidate…		https://t.co/hOswgeaWdA
@RepMaxineWaters When are you going to wake up to the fact he is not?!  It's YOU, and YOUR party that are the REAL liars and hypocrites...not to mention baby killers.
MAXINE MELTDOWN! Waters begs Americans to ‘turn the television off’ during Trump SOTU.		Tough shit low IQ Waters.		https://t.co/EjpDUoo3PS
Hey Democrats, Trump's approval back up to 48%. Eat your heart out.		https://t.co/WNmnEtjyW1
@SenGillibrand They are succeeding like they NEVER did under Obama and the Democrats.  Democrats destroy economies, not build them.
@KamalaHarris Well, it was your party who shot down the bill to pay them backpay, take it up with Pelosi.
@tedlieu @POTUS Oh shut up.
@PattyMurray Send more troops. Trump doesn't have to answer your stupid questions, he's the CinC.
@drudgefeed Did the bear get high?
@brianstelter Easy to understand, lift up the American people, improve the economy, rebuild the military, more respect overseas, and I could go on. Best president in my lifetime.
@tedlieu Stick it.
@AOC But, already been taxed!
@tedlieu @RepMcGovern No we don't! Not when the House is run with Marxists as it is now.
@SenBlumenthal Oh knock off the hypocrisy, you were fine with the policy when Obama intiated it.
@AOC Duh?
@HillaryClinton Yeah, let's just kill their babies...typical leftist solution.  Democrat Party: The Party of Death.
@PattyMurray Then get off your lazy butt and get to work on an immigration reform bill! Stop the whining and BS!  Compromise on the wall!
@AOC I think I'll drive my big old gas guzzler into town, and buy some new clothes, and maybe a new coffee mug, tool around town somemore, top off gas tank,.....
@tedlieu @MattWhitaker46 Stick it.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Liar!
@SenKamalaHarris Speak the truth????  You mean leftist opininated bullshit?  I'd rather watch snow melt than listen to anything that comes out of your lying mouth.
@SenSchumer Stop the bullshit! The middle class are far better off under Trump than they ever were under the 8 disasterous years of Obama and you democrats!!!!!!  Best president ever!!!!!!!
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump "The American people are not dumb. You disrespect us by treating us like we're stupid???" You're the stupid one, pal...dumber than a bag of hammers. All those criminals, illegals, sexual predators, drugs, MS-13's, are just fine with you.
NBC News panel blames Trump for Ralph Northam's blackface scandal.		Just one, of about ten million, reasons I don't watch NBC News.		https://t.co/YjpLmhYnxS

@MsAvaArmstrong I hope he passes a lot of gas.
@PattyMurray @Interior @EPA It's the economy and the American people he is standing up for, just the opposite of what you and your Party of death stands up for.
Democrats have a free ride for human-traffickers in their immigration proposal.		https://t.co/edVDmUjDeO
@catturd2 @RonJWalters My hand is raised high!
@ABC @Tea_Party_Chris Cool.
@PattyMurray @BetsyDeVosED You're pure evil.
@AOC All of it, should b egreat, just skip the rebuttal by the leftist loser.
@AOC @staceyabrams I would rather watch snow melt than watch an anti-American left-wing bad loser like her.
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Racist wall?  How in the hell did you ever get elected Senator with your pea sized leftist brain?  BTW, have you visited the border...of course not, you just hate Trump...to hell with saving American lives, just hate Trump is your motto.
@AmyMek @MC_Mad_Man She needs to be deported, along with anyone who voted for this Jew hating anti-American POS.
@SenBlumenthal @qctimes @ChuckGrassley I don't trust anything with your name on it.
@brianstelter The leftist media destroys Democracy...especially CNN.
@PattyMurray @BetsyDeVosED You need to resign after blocking the bill to stop infanticide.  You're pure evil.
@Ilhan @amprog I'd rather watch snow melt.  Progressives don't have values, only destructiveness.
@SidneyPowell1 @AnthemRespect After watching your excellent interview with Mark Levin, I got so mad I immediately ordered your book.  Should get it today.
@HillaryClinton @ACLU Easy to see why you're NOT president!  Your Party of Death created this policy under Obama, and of course you leftist hypocrites were fine with it then. Hypocrite! Liar!
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Oh stop it, hypocrite. Your Party of Death created this policy under the evil Obama, and of course you liked it then.  If you were really concerned, you would get off your lazy ass and work with the GOP for some REAL immigration policy reform.
@janderson0925 Remove them, and the voters who voted for these anti-Americans.
@PattyMurray You blocked the Senate Bill Prohibiting Infanticide???!!! You're pure evil Senator. But then, you do belong to the Party of Death.
@cathie_peterson @FoxNews And, the leftist morons like you will listen to fake news CNN and swallow every bit of it...Gullible. You'll rejoice and celebrate the Party of Death, and their continual assault on freedom, and destruction of the American economy and way of life. Pathetic.
@speakrofhouse @inittowinit007 Sure glad I don't live in VA.
@AprilDRyan Typical leftist Trump haters. But, Trump will have the last laugh when he goes down in history as one of the best presidents ever.  So, get over it.
@BoSnerdley @CNNPolitics I don't read anything written or presented by CNN, I prefer REAL HONEST TRUEFUL news stories.
@DeepStateExpose @OscuraPraetoria Goes to show anyone can be called a scholar now days...even an embecile like this nutbag.
@TheJuanWilliams The Superbowl was a dud?  You don't know much about football do you?  It was a masterful display of Belichick's defense plays, held the Rams to 3 points...masterful.   Now, The Five last night, there was a real dud.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Yeah, you scumbags on the left block, or sue, anything that is good for America.  But, hey, killing babies is just fine with you.  Drugs, MS-13 gangmembers, sexual predators, criminals, terrorists coming over the border is fine with you too.
@THEANTHEMGIRL SR-71, one of the best planes ever built.  Too bad it was decommissioned just because the new General in charge at the time never liked it.
@1stAirDel_USMCR @Tea_Party_Chris My kind of singer.
@RandPaul @FairyQ15 @realDonaldTrump Bring them home.
@realannapaulina @FairyQ15 @POTUS I voted no because of the RINOs in the Senate, who will prevent it from happening.

@McguireScotty @TRPhrophet Wow! I used to live just a couple miles from where this crash occurred.
@JohnCornyn @TRPhrophet Sure, they're the Party of Death.
@mitchellvii @1019dotty @AOC Yep.
@mikebwonder @realDonaldTrump Hmmmmm...let's see...most accomplishments in first two years than any president in history. I guess Nicole loved it when Obama showed up in the Oval Office around 9:30 am, hung around a couple hours and then played golf?
@CNN @AprilDRyan With a miniscule audience...no one wants to listen to a loser, especially a poor loser.
@kylegriffin1 @AprilDRyan Yep, no one cares, pal.
@yashar @AprilDRyan She was pure evil then, and she is pure evil now...only real change is that she is a drunken sot now.
I just blocked three climate change wackos because debating these nutbags, is like spitting into the wind. They have bought all the failed computer model crap and swear it's gospel.  THERE'S NO REAL EMPIRICAL PROOF OF MAN CAUSED CLIMATE CHANGE!
@whoTHknows @WeiZhangAtmos @Shdwsnlite @SenWhitehouse Yep, caused by the sun.
@WeiZhangAtmos @Shdwsnlite @whoTHknows @SenWhitehouse Climate change iscaused by the sun NOT man.
@whoTHknows @WeiZhangAtmos @Shdwsnlite Not nonsense...FACT.  Do some REAL research!
@SenatorDurbin Oh please, stop the hypocrisy and bullshit.
@KiltronXEnviro That's his emotional support bug(s).
@MulcahyA Spineless wonders.
@Thomas1774Paine Okay, better start taking some courses in how to speak Chinese and Russian...idiots.

@T_S_P_O_O_K_Y @NevadaJack2 Cohen that is
@T_S_P_O_O_K_Y @NevadaJack2 POS
@RepCohen Idiot!  The REAL lazy presidents were Obama and Clinton. Study some history.  Trump has accomplished more in two years than any president in history.  Glad you're boycotting the SOTU...no one wants to see your scowling face anyway.
@RepCohen "repeated injuries to our Constitution and democracy must be brought to an end???" Don't vote for Democrats.  Trump: greatest president of our time...get over it.
@SenWhitehouse Climate change is caused by the sun, not man, and it goes in cycles...go back to school.
@SenWhitehouse Compared to you Democrats in the bow?
@KamalaHarris Don't appoint/hire Democrats as Wardens.
@PattyMurray @usedgov Yeah, right...ho hum...yawn
@ewarren And, destroy the economy. You Democrats are good at that.
@FlyingEagle555 @Cali_Tracii No doubt a RINO.
@SenWhitehouse @ODNIgov BULLSHIT!
@SenSchumer And, workers got more money in their pockets, and wages have gone up...stop the lies and bullshit.
@KamalaHarris @morningmika You mean the manufactured truth (we call them lies) by you leftists, right?
@SenAlexander What's really criminal is what colleges are charging for tuition!  Investgate that.
@TheJuanWilliams @thehill @TheHillOpinion It's going to be a tragedy for you, and your leftist pals, when Trump is exonerated.
@donaldtrumpforc @lacerci65 Criminal!
@SenatorDurbin You freakin' hypocrites!  Obama intiated this policy and you were fine with it then. I suggest you, and your leftist pals get off your lazy asses and pass a REAL immigration reform policy! But, no you would rather blame Trump for your laziness.
@marklutchman @Tea_Party_Chris I agree.
@KamalaHarris You mean Hillary's collusion with the Russians, right? You know, paying for the bogus dossier, and the $400K donation from the Russians, selling access, selling 20% of our uranium, etc etc etc
@JoeNBC More leftist BS...sigh.
@RepJerryNadler @RepMaloney @cjewishhistory @IsraelinNewYork @JoePotasnik @Hadassah If it is written and submitted by a Democrat, guaranteed it won't do any of that.
@KamalaHarris We have that now. Next bullshit statement.
@SenKamalaHarris Secure the border then, Senator!!!!!!!!
@tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump You outdo yourself in stupidity in every tweet.
@citizenangela @RalphNader @RickClaypool @skrocentral zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn
@PattyMurray @usedgov If it bothers you leftist's, it must be another good move by Trump.  And, good for the American people.
@RalphNader Absolute BULLSHIT!  How stupid do you think the American people are?  I know there are a lot of ignorant and misinformed voters who vote for you leftists, but many of them won't buy this hogwash.  If there is, this country is finished.
@IlhanMN You should be deported.
@CoryBooker Democrats will NEVER put aside their differences, who are you trying to kid?  Democrats divide.  Democrats destroy.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....yawn
@MistyLynnGray1 @SenWarren Good point.
@2AWisdom @azkathmath Bazooka ammo!
@greenfield64 @JessicaTarlov Get over it!
@SenWarren Okay, who's imitating Warren?  This is the only tweet where I agree with her 100%.  Still wouldn't vote for her.
@4YrsToday @FreedomCalling2 Hmmmm...60% Trump haters. Whether they like it or not, he has accomplished more in two years than any president in history...and, all good. Booming economy!

@Tomhoyt6 @RogerCaynor Eight years of Obama created this.
@tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Oh shut up, you're getting boring...freakin' hypocrite.
@timkaine @SenatorDurbin And, replace him with a Lt Gov who is accused of sexual assault, yeah that's gonna work.  What is in the water in Virginia?
@SenWhitehouse @Patriots Big Trump fans too!
@gailsline @deanbc1 Jericho, west bank?

@StoopidTallKid @ewarren @BarbaraComstock Trust me, Dems will screw it up...either by writing a bad bill, which they're famous for or voting against it themselves.

@davidzurawik @brianstelter But, you bought all of Obama's and Clinton's lies...right?  Hypocrite!
@StoopidTallKid @ewarren @BarbaraComstock Democrats will block it.
@RepDarrenSoto @TSA Blame yourself (and your leftist pals) you could have prevented the shutdown, but you chose not to.  Your fault.
@ewarren @BarbaraComstock So? You Democrats bob around the rules all the time....ooooohhh, I forgot, this is a oneway street, my bad.
@ericbolling @Tea_Party_Chris BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!  Good one!  		We miss seeing you on The Five.
@swdunlap @chowdallas Every day.
@Ilhan You should be deported!
@Ilhan Yaeh, that mean old Trump is trying to deport her...yeah, right...more leftist bullcrap.
@ZyroFoxtrot I trust Roberts as far as I can throw him...the next Sandra Day O'Conner.
@SenatorDurbin Prison Warden is probably a Democrat.
@EinsteinMaga @BigErnie2020 @CoryBooker @SenMajLdr @HouseGOP Democrats don't need no stinkin' evidence.
@mitchellvii @Tea_Party_Chris I think you're right.
@brianstelter Lots of opportunities for fake news there.
@william_kamper @christianllamar @Lrihendry I watched the weather channel until the halftime debacle was over.
@PattyMurray You are so phony!!!!!!!  He's been WILLING to compromise, but you leftist HYPOCRITES want everything!  STOP THE BS AND HYPOCRISY!
@mkramer @brianstelter That AD was disgusting.
@brianstelter @ReliableSources @JFKucinich zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn
@MsGladysKnight @RmoonDrmoo3n Good job!
@TomFitton @TheriotChristy @realDonaldTrump Right on!
@Mynock74 @Maxineskrazy He should be arrested for filing a false police report.
@AOC Get YOUR facts straight!  Two teams/owners (Fan Francisco &amp; Denver) offered the racist Kaepernick a contract and he turned them both down.  He doesn't want an NFL job, he wants the phony racist issue!  He's scum.
@RashidaTlaib @DebbieforFL Destroying America one Marxist / Muslim candidate at a time.
@Serremmy Hookers dress like hookers.
@BoSnerdley @seattletimes They always do, and they take the economy with it...the Democrat way.
@SenJeffMerkley You mean Obama, correct?  He iniated this policy, and you leftist morons in Congress WILL NOT write or pass an Immigration reform bill that will correct it!  So, look in the mirror and blame yourself!  Damn hypocrite!
@yogagenie @Jamierodr10 And, he's right.  I used to just dislike Democrats in the past, even though I used to be one, now, after two year of Trump hatred by the MSM and left, I absolutely hate them.
@FuctupMike @YourServiceYW A sot.
@clivebushjd @Jamierodr10 What's this guy's district?  San Quentin Prision?
@Jamierodr10 @letgobestill Wow!

@JuddLegum You love talking out your ass don't you?
@kwilli1046 @Tea_Party_Chris Yep, I have.
@washingtonpost Absolute DISGUSTING (and untrue) was that Ad you ran during the Superbowl.  Shame on you! Just another left-wing fake news rag.
@DanaPerino Ahem....New England Patriots 13...Los Angeles Rams 3...ahem.
@adriandt31 @darhar981 Thumbs up!
@AOC Do they get room service?
@BoSnerdley Nope...disgusting. Worst AD.
@USALoyalty1776 And, he says they poured bleach on his face, pretty hard to do when bleach freezes at around17-19 degrees, and it was well below zero outside.  Can you spell H-O-A-X?
@brianstelter You would....fake news reporter.  Eagles suck.
@Dougs1978 @gspatton007 @BreitbartNews Great game!
@HanifeLong @Tia6sc Yes!
@RealJamesWoods And, Pelosi could care less.
@Lawrence BULLSHIT!
@marklevinshow Can someone be more stupid than an idiot?  If possible, she would qualify.
@brianstelter Washington Post Superbowl AD was the worst!  A disgrace. Amazon's ADs were the best.
@SenFeinstein Like you...LOSERS!
@PattyMurray NOT retweeting!
@PattyMurray @FBI And, it could have been easily preventable, right?  Stop the lies and hypocrisy.
@Jack_Torrance__ @baalter Some real cowards.
@tedlieu @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump You're wierd.
@SenBlumenthal Keep it private.
@WayneDupreeShow @LNW4Trump Or, Chucky himself.........
@KamalaHarris @AyannaPressley No we don't.  Way too many Democrats now.
@IlhanMN I'll tell you where you can find 'sympathy' in the dictionary, it's between 'shit' and 'syphilis.'
@jjz1600 @IlhanMN @RashidaTlaib They're unpatriotic anti-American Muslims!  And, Rashida Tlaib used a fake address when voting and doesn't even live in her district.  IlhanMN married her brother! They're frauds!
@william_kamper @christianllamar @Lrihendry Yep, turn it on when they're lining up for the kick-off and mute the halftime show.  Go Patriots.
@jobeeswing @MissILmom @JoanofAmerica @BarackObama @POTUS @GenFlynn Oh if it only were true!   I'd save a copy!  Hell, I'd probably buy a couple hundred copies!
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump I'm sick and tired of you Democrats killing babies, so shut up! BTW, for your education, a Democrat, by the name of Obama, started this child separation policy and you were fine with it then.  Stop the BS and hypocrissy!
@SpeakerPelosi Here's a novel idea for you, require a valid ID and only get to vote once.  No felons, no non-citizens, no underage, no dead...problem solved.
@RepJeffries When does the room service start?
@FreedomWorks @hotairblog Electric bills went up to $1200 a month plus.
@RepSwalwell Do-nothing Congressman in a incompetent and corrupt party.
@SenCortezMasto @PattyMurray @SenateDems @BetsyDeVosED The students are doing just fine with Betsy DeVos as Sec of Education.  So, stop the manufactured panic.
@KamalaHarris Our Democracy was doing fine until Obama was elected, and then Trump had to save it.  So, no, we don't need another incompetent corrupt liar Democrat for president so we can repeat the Obama years over again.
@brianstelter @AOC @saikatc zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS You Democrats have a lot of gall to accuse anyone of lying! Democrats are the champion liars, and Obama was the king of liars.  So, stop the BS, you sound stupid.
You and your party are the racists, Senator...not Trump! @SenSherrodBrown
Utah - The Greatest Show On Earth		A few landscape photos I have taken in Utah.  Enjoy.		https://t.co/rfQqLTZ0SX
@horowitz39 Yep...so true.
@RogerCaynor Eight years of Obama created this.
@horowitz39 Only on CNN!
@brianstelter @axios More BS and fake news from the champion fake news reporter.
@KamalaHarris But, hey you Democrats started the Civil War over slavery, created the KKK, created Jim Crow laws, voted against the Civil Rights Act, etc.etc.  So, go preach to YOUR party...the Republican Party is the real party of diverstity.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Trump doesn't need any of your inane stupid BS input.  Trump has a brain....something you're still looking for.
@RepBarbaraLee @SpeakerPelosi Pelosi is pure evil.
@Semaphore89 @STAND_For_FLAG_ There's no such thing as a peaceful Muslim...read the Koran.
@PolarWhut @JZahav1 He sure put on some great entertainment.
@AOC But, I like my eggs over easy.

@WayneDupreeShow @smalltownandrew Coming out next week as a Democrat candidate for 2020.
@harambe_fren @USALoyalty1776 That's all these wimps can handle is a dummy.
@1Kekster @PsychoMetalHed You got that right!
@tedlieu Why are you in Congress? You don't do anything but tweet stupid stuff all day long.  Anymore donations from Ed Buck?
@AOC @saikatc zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....yawn
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Blah, blah, blah....yawn...you're getting boring and stupid,Teddy boy.  Hey, Ed Buck called, he wants a sleepover with you.
@RalphNader zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn
@tedlieu @HowardSchultz You Democrats fear Howard Schultz because he'll take votes from all the socialist candidates. Phonies.
@RadioFreeTom @Lawrence Fake news Washington Post.
@SenSanders Liar.
@PattyMurray Well, maybe Pelosi and Schumer should have negotiated in good faith (a term you Democrats like to use) and reached a compromise maybe then there wouldn't have been a shutdown.  Stop the BS and hypocrissy.
@Tony19542 A.
@brianstelter @CNN @rubycramer @davidzurawik @jmsummers Sorry, I NEVER watch fake news CNN.
@KamalaHarris Reclaim our future????  A socialist future?  Third world status is your idea of the future.
@bjgold7 @Maxineskrazy Yep.
@cs00582scs @SpeakerPelosi @JussieSmollett Only Jussie Smollett can't prove he was attacked!  And, the cops can't find any proof either.
@BoSnerdley @PageSix Who's Cardi B?
@brianstelter @ReliableSources zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....yawn
@brianstelter @mikeallen Sure, all those supposedly upstanding Democrats will be leaking and lying to all you fake news reporters, and you'll embellish, alter, skew, and just plain lie. Nothing new.
@SenGillibrand We already have restored power to the people, and compassion to the government, it's called TRUMP.  Democrats divide.  Democrats destroy. BTW, we saw all that compassion in your state, killing babies...Democrat compassion.
@PattyMurray Pelosi and Schumer created the shutdown because they wouldn't negotiate or compromise!  Get it straight!  This isn't about building or funding a wall, it's all about ensuring Trump fails!  Typical dirty Democrat politics.
@Irwbpk @HRBlockAnswers I took accounting too, and even tutored accounting in college (have a BBA and MBA in Information Systems) and did my own taxes for years until they became too complicated.  The tax system became too complicated.
@watspn1013 @rratkinson I bet this freakin' moron doesn't even know which end of a gun to hold.
@RyanAFournier @JTaylor_JTaylor Right on!
@RepAdamSchiff So, this excuses your incompetence and doing absolutely nothing?!  You're such a hypocrite and liar.
@Irwbpk @HRBlockAnswers My taxes are a little complicatedand H&amp;R does a good job...especially when they saved my butt backing me in a refile several years ago.
@Irwbpk @HRBlockAnswers Huh?  What's creditKarma?  I tweeted, then called H&amp;R.
@floridaguy267 @YourServiceYW Islam is a made up religion.
@Irwbpk @HRBlockAnswers I have used it for years too, with no problems.  This year I kept getting a 404 error when trying to down load it online.  Finally, after two hours on the phone, and three support staff, we finally got it solved.  Frustrating.
@brianstelter @ReliableSources @AOC @saikatc I'd rather watch snow melt.
@SidneyPowell1 @MissILmom I watched your interview with Mark Levin...excellent.  I'm buying the book.
@RepSwalwell It was Obama and you Democrats who created this student loan mess!  Damn hypocrites!
@RealJamesWoods @LovToRideMyTrek Democrat.
@brianstelter @jmartNYT Give him a couple months and you leftist fake news reporters will forget all about him...hell, give him just a couple weeks.
@HillaryClinton Oh, that's rich coming from you.
@MichaelT_45 @marcus_vnr She's pure evil.
@RealSaavedra @Irwbpk Go man go!
@Thomas1774Paine Scumbag lying Democrats.  Zinke was the best Interior Sec we've ever had.
@RealJamesWoods Don't have much choice in my small town.
@catturd2 @jenniforlyn He qualifies, he's a Democrat.
@FuctupMike @jenniforlyn Love it!
@GovMikeHuckabee @LovToRideMyTrek Yeah, that hole gets deeper and deeper.
@SpeakerPelosi @RepMaxineWaters @FSCDems The two most evil women in Congress!
@SpeakerPelosi HR1 is JUST THE OPPOSITE!  How about telling the truth for JUST once in your lying life.
@SpeakerPelosi @JussieSmollett Prove he was attacked!  Because he can't prove it! Nor, can the cops. And, you have a lot of room to talk about hate...you're the queen of hate.
@adamscrabble Hey, that's Ted Lieu's biggest donor you're referring to.  I think Ted wants a sleepover with Ed.
@jdawsey1 @TulpaOmega I'm not a Democrat.
@PattyMurray Stop wasting time, FUND THE WALL!
@tedlieu @RalphNortham And, so do you.
@KamalaHarris It will NEVER get greater than this with a Democrat as president, and you can take that to the bank.
@AOC Aaaahhhhh, a mental institute patient?
@SenBlumenthal Good.
@colliertimothy8 Right on!
@RepJerryNadler But, he's a Democrat, and Democrats only have to say they're sorry.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS So, genius, say some rogue nation or any country nukes us, what do you do?	A. bend over and grab your ankles	B. immediately surrender w/o a response	C. do nothing &amp; blame it on Trump	D. Or, launch nukes back?		Knowing you, it would be a,b, or c.  Chickenshit.
How do you download the software? I get a 404 message, and then I call your support number and you disconnect me!  What's going on? @HRBlockAnswers
@SenGillibrand @NHYoungDems Aaaaahhhhh, young commies in training.
@RealJamesWoods @eavesdropann And, 'pure evil' Pelosi smiles.Disgusting.
@KamalaHarris All Democrats should resign because they are the TRUE racists.
@d_Battalion @Maxineskrazy Fake News CNN.
@WhiteHouse Republicans have always stood behind African Americans, it was the Democrats who didn't; i.e., founded the KKK, created Jim Crow Laws, voted against the Civil Rights Bill, etc, etc, etc.....
@SenGillibrand For that reason, all Democrats should resign, because they're the TRUE racists.
@usmc_army Sure!  CNN did it on purpose because all their news is fake, manufactured or altered.
@PattyMurray Work in 'good faith?????'  You Democrats DO NOT KNOW HOW TO WORK IN GOOD FAITH!!!!!!! To you Democrats, it's my way or the highway!  Well, I hope OUR GREAT President makes you eat those words.
@CoryBooker BS!  Democrats divide and destroy.
@IlhanMN @AOC @RashidaTlaib @AyannaPressley But, killing babies is okay?  You should be removed from Congress, you're a disgrace to The House and the country.
@STACEYDUBOIS4 @TMURPH88 I bet Pelosi and Schumer are pissed.
@SenWhitehouse @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump She is pure evil.
@SenatorDurbin BS!
@HLAurora63 @kjune65 @FoxNews Her and Juan Williams!
@SXMProgress @RashidaTlaib @RepMaxineWaters @LeaderHoyer @RepMarkTakano @DeeTwoCents Nah, I think I'll watch snow melt...more exciting.
@BoldProgressive @RashidaTlaib @AOC @IlhanOmar Yep, gotta be bold to kill all those babies...hypocrites.  I don't stand with baby killers and socialists.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @MC_Mad_Man Spot on!
@horowitz39 Not yet...don't think one exists.
@DemRedistrict @EricHolder Eric Holder is as corrupt as they come.
@HLAurora63 @LaylaAlisha11 Resume enhancement for a Democrat.
@ddale8 @JoyAnnReid BS!
@Solmemes1 @oneyebat Democrat Party: The Party of Death.
@amjoyshow @JoyAnnReid @NBCNews Bathroom Booker and Heels Up Harris...what a combo.
@RealJamesWoods Yep. Elect a Democrat as president in 2020 and that will be the last nail in the coffin.
@PattyMurray What a crock of absolute crap!
@RepMaxineWaters Crawl back under your rock Low IQ Waters!  Your lies are getting old.
@adriandt31 Go Patriots.
@PattyMurray @rosadelauro Yawn
@DailyCaller @SL1733 Good...we didn't want to see him anyway.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse More winning!
@smalltownandrew @pinkk9lover @CNN I will make a point to wear my MAGA hat more often now.
Nevada officials had no clue the federal government shipped plutonium to their state.		Shop more to Yucca Mtn...the perfect place for it.		https://t.co/EXTqP0pInj
@PattyMurray Hope it is shot down or vetoed.
@CoryBooker Blah,blah,blah...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump In your dreams, pal.
@CoryBooker Yeah, right...if anyone believes that I got a prime ocean view in NV I'll sell ya.  You Democrats say this kind of crap every election, then we find out much later it was a lie.
@HowardSchultz @benshapiro @WSJ Run!
@CensoredC1 @_Sm1ttyjr @AOC Democrats ALWAYS promise stuff they can't deliver!
@LouDobbs @ArmyOfTrump1 @EdRollins @realDonaldTrump Spot on!  Ryan was a Trump hating RINO.
@AprilDRyan Oh give me a break...he's a fraud.
@CoryBooker You're not going to unite anyone, you'll be a divider just like Obama was. Stop the BS.
@CoryBooker Commie supporting a commie.
@AprilDRyan All clowns...all socialists with no leadership skills.
@CoryBooker I agree with James Turner.
@Schottey @CoryBooker Our current president is a good person who enjoys helping people. Our current president believes in a properous America, Booker believes in a third world socialist America. Booker couldn't lead a horse to water and he is only out for himself.  He's a fraud.
@CoryBooker I don't support candidates who couldn't lead horse to water, and you can't.
@RoseDC11 @DustieDahl That day will be when America is totally destroyed, and they will say "we did that."
A DIGITAL IRON CURTAIN DESCENDS OVER THE INTERNET	Why free speech on the web - as we once knew it - will be over within a decade.	https://t.co/GQf8bPD1Rs
@SenJeffMerkley Nor, is killing babies, but you're okay with that.  Did your mother teach that to you also?
@MaryKeating9 @Serremmy Well, it did take some courage to tell all those lies publicly.
@Tactical_review @tk_atty I had one similar...cap gun.
@Truthseeker126 @codeofvets It is a hoax.
@mauricemansa @Herbert_L_Reed BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!
@DoThinkin And, the lack of any leadership skills.
Exactly. https://t.co/HkHA2Lq70F
Send this to Pelosi. https://t.co/rjWDyVo3U1
@MaryKeating9 @GeraldoRivera @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump She is pure evil.
@DoThinkin @reubenrr Spot on!
@CoryBooker I don't support communists.
@SenGillibrand @CoryBooker Another loser joins the clown convention.  Should be fun watching who can promise the most goodies and who can out-left who.  Get out the popcorn.  Collectively if all these candidates (and prospective candidates) brains were gas they couldn't start a piss ants motorscooter.
@replouiegohmert More winning!
@BuckSexton Because it would reveal the hoax.
@ZionistGirl18 He's a punk.
@watspn1013 @GlendaKayCampb1 @realDonaldTrump Because they're more into making political points than saving American lives.  They don't care about the American people only their own power...they hate Trump that much.  Pathetic.
If he did, law enforcement would see it is all a hoax. https://t.co/CTr3KID0Em
@realDonaldTrump Bring them home.
@NightStar44 I used to be a Democrat. The 'Scoop' Jackson conservative type Democrat.  Today's Republican (except a few RINOs) more represents the Democrats of the 50s and 60s. It was Obama who really did a lot of damage and moved the DNC to the left.
@JussieSmollett Move then.
@Redtowel4 He's the gay guy who made up the "attacked by MAGA wearing whites in Chicago" story.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Yes!
@SenWhitehouse @LindseyGrahamSC Confirm Barr now and stop the BS.
@Derameth @aligiarc @senatemajldr @SpeakerPelosi HR1 is to ensure no Republican ever wins an election again.
@RealJamesWoods @tduke8809 I just love it when Democrats are disappointed.
@GOPLeader @GlendaKayCampb1 What?????????
@TimRunsHisMouth Of course not.
@RepSwalwell Sure, because you Democrats have no interest in protecting Americans, you're only interested in getting Trump...no matter how many Americans die to do it.  Disgusting.
@WayneDupreeShow Bring in the clowns, the more the merrier.  Their debates should be good entertainment, as it will be "I can out left you," and "I can promise more goodies than you."  Of course they can't deliver any of them.
@RepSwalwell @HouseJudiciary Oh yeah, let the lies begin.
@SenFeinstein @SenKamalaHarris Oh boo hoo.  Trump did the right thing, thank God!
@seeker55836925 @EpochTimes @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @POTUS Because the public would be shocked to see how many Democrats are sexual predators!
@lilbulli1031 @yogagenie @POTUS I wanna see 10 years of her tax returns.
@SenatorDurbin Prove he was attacked, because he can't prove it.  I'll wager that it was all made up.
@SenatorDurbin HR1 is to ensure a Republican never wins another election...get it straight.
@D_Eric_L @robertdunlap947 Love it!
@PattyMurray But, it's okay when the Democrats use the military as political prop...hypocrite.  And, it's okay when the Democrats leave America vulnerable when drastically cutting the military...hypocrite.
@PattyMurray Your parties solutions don't work, and you know it, and you could care less.
@RyanAFournier Yeah, it's looking more and more like a made up story.
@AnthemRespect @mitchellvii Democrat Party: The Party of Death.
@Landslide1973 @whatznextfolks And, the only people listening will be Trump haters...small audience.
Finished my one-day suspension.  Evidently, Sen. Blumenthal took umbrage to me referring to him as DaNang Dick and Stolen Valor and reported me, and I got suspended. Scumbag can't handle the truth.
@PattyMurray Hypocrite!  Liar!
@SenBlumenthal Tell any Vietnam war stories?
@KamalaHarris The Election Day/national holiday idea is stupid.
@BMcAdory9 @DanCovfefe1 @bigleaguepol She needs to be recalled.
@Josh_Berhow @PerspicaciousXY Great video.
@gbroh10 @Rainbow_Whisper @CloverChron Interesting...if true.
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump But, hey, it was okay when Obama did it...remember?  Hypocrite!
@AdamSchiff Hey, Schitt-for-brains, stop the hypocrisy and bullshit. Your lies are getting old.
@SenGillibrand No we don't.
@KamalaHarris Access to healthcare  IS NOT A RIGHT!  And, you well know that you can't produce Medicare for all, you couldn't tax the people enough to pay for it...impossible. You Democrats always promise things you can't produce, and have no intention to produce.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Yep, the American people aren't stupid, but you sure as hell aren't the brightest bulb in the room.  But, hey, keep these tweets coming and I'll wager a different election outcome in two years, asshole.
@ewarren Have a beer.
@ChuckCallesto Story seems very suspicious to me. Until I see some actual evidence, I'm not buying it.
@RealSaavedra @lovewrenching36 And, he's exactly right.  But, the leftist voters don't care.
@1776Stonewall Excellent question!
@SenAlexander @PattyMurray I don't trust any bill that has Patty Murray's name on it.
@Dougs1978 @gex_daniel @BreitbartNews Yeah, it's called poor loser Democrats!
@RepMoBrooks @Aikens_Josh @realDonaldTrump Good.
@fred_guttenberg @PattyMurray She couldn't lead horse to water.
@jparkABC @AOC If it's written and presented by a Democrat it's a bad bill.
@brianstelter Hmmmmmm, that many people like fiction.
@AOC Are you really that stupid?  Or, is it just an act?
@tedlieu So?  Hey, Ed Buck called and he wants a sleep over.
@SenBlumenthal @HASCDemocrats Money well spent DaNang Dick. SECURE THE BORDER!  FUND THE WALL!
@RepSwalwell Another brillant statement from Swelledhead...freakin' moron.
@Phil_Lewis_ @Maxineskrazy This story seems suspicious to me, I suggest we wait and see what comes of the investigation before passing any judgements.
@SenJeffMerkley $1.5 T????  Where did you get that number, outta your rear?  The Treasury is still taking in record amounts of tax dollars!
@RepCummings @HouseDemocrats Noon HR7 and HR1.  Terrible bills.
@tedlieu Boycott them.
@BCStarGzr @Jamierodr10 @BreitbartNews I prefer the first name 'Horizontal' myself...more accurate.
@yogagenie @Jamierodr10 Let's see how they vote.
@yogagenie @Jamierodr10 I hope he does it.
@AndrewGillum @AprilDRyan @staceyabrams Yeah, I heard Jake (the janitor) turned it down.
@RashidaTlaib @JussieSmollett The dangerous lies spewing from the left wing is killing &amp; hurting our people!  Get it straight.  Democrats are destroying this country.
@tannerstake @rratkinson I wanna see 10 years of her tax returns.
@kylegriffin1 @tedlieu This bill ain't going anywhere.
@TheJuanWilliams More racial tests! More racial tests! More racial tests! More racial tests!
@TheJuanWilliams Hey Juan, where did you get that poll number of 56% of voters won't vote for Trump? What was the breakdown, I bet there were far more Democrats and Trump haters in the make up, OR, you just made it up.
@TheBeaSmith Yep, I agree.
@silver_fox9 @Redtowel4 She was the only one left after Jake (the janitor) turned it down.
@senatemajldr @DwightCooper16 Block HR1.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump No one wants to hear a loser.  I do want to hear our president...FUND THE WALL AND SECURE THE BORDER, ASSHOLE!
@Trump454545 @HLAurora63 This is sickening.
@OLDFLACO @SealeyGerald Ooooohhh, I want that wall NOW!
@JudicialWatch @big4prezole There's your Russia Collusion.
@TheBeaSmith @WashTimes How about The Liars Club award instead...more fitting.
@SenBlumenthal You wanna get people killed in your state by taking their guns, fine, but stay the fuck out of my state, pal.
@FreeBeacon Perfect fit...fake news, fake governor.
@tedlieu Surge in border crossings fuels demands for border wall.		https://t.co/24YDbkox9l
@tedlieu You're a liar and an idiot, Ted.
@KamalaHarris Try and take my guns...
@SenatorDurbin STFU Turbin Durbin...you're getting boring.
@SpeakerPelosi HR1 is a terrible bill.  Vote NO on HR1.
@PattyMurray How about you Democrats clean it up!  You created the mess.

@MohanadElshieky You should be deported!
@tedlieu @MSNBC @AliVelshi @SRuhle Thanks for the warning...I won't be watching.

@RepDLesko @GOPLeader You got it!
@RepSwalwell @HouseDemocrats @HouseJudiciary ".@HouseDemocrats' first priority in 2019: restoring confidence in our #democracy. ????" BWAHAHAHAHJAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  You're a joke.
@tedlieu @HouseJudiciary So, you're saying it is okay for a government official to have classified material on an unsecured server in their residence? You freakin' moron!  Enjoy your two years, because with BS like this you'll lose the House in a landslide.

@Dougs1978 @1bad540i @BreitbartNews Yeah, it's called Democrats.

@CattHarmony @Phishie_Philly I don't like Starbucks because of their liberal politics, but if the Dems start a boycott of Starbucks, I will become a big customer.

@Acosta Bring on the stupid and biased questions.  Real journalism is dead.
@SenWhitehouse Burn fossil fuels.
@SenWhitehouse How many tax breaks did they get?
@tedlieu @HouseJudiciary @RepSarbanes If it's written and submitted by a Democrat it will do none of these.  Protect voting rights by requiring an ID! Leave the finance laws alone because any change by a Democrat will benefit ONLY Democrats.
@AprilDRyan You just ask stupid questions. You're ONLY interested in getting a gaffe out of Sanders and anything bad on Trump.  So, don't give me this crap you're actually asking constructive questions on the news of the day.
@RealErinCruz @KamalaHarris Too bad her mother didn't believe in abortion...just sayin'.

@PolishPatriotTM @Schairvo Commie bastard.
@Catmandu50 @JamesBo51072455 @realDonaldTrump I agree.
@ChuckCallesto @Tea_Party_Chris How to fake news for Dummies.
@KamalaHarris Tens of thousands? I'm sure that's exaggerated.  Quit while you're ahead Horizontal Harris, if elected you would be an unmitigated disaster...even worse than the incompetent corrupt Obama.
@adjunctprofessr @TheriotChristy @POTUS Three time loser.
@NancyJKoch @yojudenz WTF!
@HowardSchultz @Maxineskrazy Trump is representing the silent majority of the American people...get over it.
@RashidaTlaib Stuck in Detroit is a good place for you.
@ewarren Have a beer.
@NancyJKoch @yojudenz Criminal!
@jakepalmieri @baalter I've  been saying this for years!  Thank you Barack Hussein Obama. Actually started under Clinton, and was depleted by two wars under Bush, and Obama's cuts were just criminal.
@KamalaHarris You will destroy America!  The economy and Americans working are the highest in history, and your socialism will destroy all that. You'll put this country right back in the disastrous Obama reign.  You're a divider, not an uniter.
@LATiffani1 @JohnnyB371 ROTFLMAO!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump No more Pelosi / Schumer shutdowns.
@DailySignal @MsAvaArmstrong STUPID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@FridaGhitis @tedlieu @KamalaHarris Yep, one incompetent endorsing another incompetent...both Marxists.

@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Hey, Ed Buck will be calling you soon, he wants asleep over.

@RalphNader What a crock of crap!
@PattyMurray No, you need to clean up Pelosi's and Schumer's mess...get it straight.  SECURE THE DAMN BORDER!!!!!
@RepSwalwell Stop oppressing the poor Swelledhead!
@tedlieu @POTUS So, you're okay with drugs, illegal aliens, MS-13 gang members, terrorists, criminals coming across the border into this country unchecked?  That's what you Democrats stand for now...can't  wait for the next election.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP Hey swelledhead, where's your proof Trump is A Russian agent? Eh?  Come on put up or shut up.
@ewarren @EPAAWheeler Good bye economy....you twit.
@marcorubio @grandmainct You voting with Democrats, or Republicans?  Just curious.
@IsraelUSAforevr @grandmainct Absolute morons.
@trendchasernews These are hilarious!
@RodStryker @CB618444 @AnthemRespect Horizontal Harris.
@marcorubio "Rubio: I Will Fight Trump Declaring National Emergency for Border Wall???"  Become a Democrat will ya, you talk and sometimes vote like one.  Damn RINO!
@KamalaHarris And, where is the money coming from to pay for all this?  Huh?  You can't tax the people enough to pay for this!  You clueless Democrats promise all these every election knowing you can't produce them.  All lies.
@45_Kimmie @rratkinson @BarackObama YES!
@PamelaUnplugged @rratkinson ROTFLMAO! Good one!
@RepDonBeyer @SpeakerPelosi @HouseDemocrats And, it won't go anywhere.  "Republicans have punished federal employees with political attacks, pay freezes, and Trump’s shutdowns????" That is your side, pal...get it straight.
@dbongino @TRPhrophet No one likes a loser.
@marklevinshow It was excellent.
@fedupcitizen16 Rubio is a RINO.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Oh STFU, you're getting boring.
@PattyMurray Wrong: you mean the mess you democrats made!  Get it straight.
@RyanAFournier @janfetterman It' s a resume enhancement for Horizontal Harris in CA.
@tedlieu Yeah Ted, stop the hate!
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Well, you had better get some $$$ for that wall in that budget! No Speaker should hold Americans as hostages again!
@JohnSharpless @JamesBo51072455 @thebradfordfile @steph93065 Ed Buck was one of Ted's biggest donors.

@AOC @brianstelter @EJRaoulduke1976 One commie interviewing another commie...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn.
@KamalaHarris If the media shows more than 10 people in the audience, it's been PhotoShopped.
@brianstelter @realDonaldTrump Who cares? Boooooorrrring.
@KamalaHarris Oakland?  Armpit of CA.  Nice place to kick off your failed campaign Horizontal Harris.
@dbongino @tduke8809 A big thumbs up!  Give it up Swelledhead!
@BuzzFeedBen @Haleaziz BuzzFeed is still in business?  I would have thought with all the fake news you spew that you would have folded by now.
@AOC @brianstelter Commie interviewing another commie.
@RepAdamSchiff Prove they're lies! Come on pencil neck, prove it or STFU.  In reality, it is your side who is doing all the lying.
@JohnBrennan @darhar981 You belong in prison, you and the whole Obama Administration...you're the REAL crooks and liars.
@IlhanMN @politico Bitter, twisted lies???  I don't think so. Resign, you're a disgrace.
@Jamierodr10 @Tia6sc Amazing!
@colliertimothy8 Horizontal Harris.
@RepAdamSchiff Schitt-for-brains, your absolute leftist bullshit is easy to ignore.  Molested any more young men lately?
@SenatorDurbin @RepCasten Our nation is on the right track after being on the wrong track during the eight years prior to Trump.  And, I can still remember the disasterous two years of Democrat control of the House, Senate, and Presidency.  Democrats destroy.
@Maxineskrazy @KamalaHarris Whoa!  ROTFLMAO!!!!!
@RalphNader New message from Democrats, same result...screwed.
@RalphNader @PacificStand Good...gut it.
@trumpgirll @groth1945 I wasn't much of a fan before, but I am now!
@MeghanMcCain "Meghan McCain: I 'Hate' America Without My Father's Leadership???!!!"  Please move.   It's nice this time of year in Venezuela.
@brianstelter @CNN Thanks for reminding me to NOT watch it.  Just more fake news.
@TerranceJMahon3 @Maxineskrazy @Idahoan4 Remember, many said Obama didn't have a chance in hell of becoming our president.  And, thanks to white guilt, we were stuck with him for eight miserable years.

@doofus44 @Maxineskrazy @KamalaHarris You don't understand Democrats, they will do anything to gain power...even prostitute themselves.
@dbongino @JamesBo51072455 He was a prosecutor for 6-7 years, and listening to this interview I guess he didn't need any proof in his prosucustions?  Wow!  Scary.  BTW, Swelledhead, if you're reading this, I did a typo on purpose, can you find it?
@WayneDupreeShow @JamesBo51072455 I never did like this woman.
@RepSwalwell Just watched your hilarious interview with Margaret Hoover, and I guess you didn't need any proof in those 6-7 years as a prosecutor?  Wow!  CA is in worse shape than I thought.  Someone needs to review your old cases, seriously.
@SenGillibrand You better spread that far and wide in your own party!  That is if you really believe it, because, several in your hypocrite party don't.
@RepSwalwell Unless you're a Democrat (especially a Clinton), then you can commit any crime you want without impunity....freakin' hypocrite.
@RepSwalwell I guess that leaves Schiff out in trying to adopt you?
@45Quickdraw4 @voteredd @SpeakerPelosi @chuckschumer Oh come now, you actually want them to start doing their job?!  Surely you jest.
@my3monkees @smalltownandrew @gatewaypundit Just another Comey.
@Thomas1774Paine Surprise, surprise.....
@dbongino @imagineworldone Swelledhead is a loser.
@adriandt31 @ReneeCarrollAZ Horizontal Harris.
@RalphNader Good place for it....keep it in Germany.
@brianstelter Bullshit!  Just another reason to NOT believe anything you, and your fake news, pals say.  He has accomplished more in two years than any president in history! Just because he is not destroying America, like your pal Obama, you hate him.
@RepSwalwell You don't mind destroying America or the president, but can't handle those typos!  Freakin' moron...swelledhead.
@SpeakerPelosi Leftist dreams.  But, that's all it is a dream.
@Sungsam12 @AOC @closmedina @KamalaHarris @DoloresHuerta @SpeakerPelosi @MichelleObama Stupid.
@CenterOnBudget Good.  I voted against the Medicaid expansion.
@ewarren Communist!
@saullonp1 @eavesdropann @DustieDahl @POTUS @newsmax RINO - Republican-In-Name-Only.
@BoSnerdley @WSJ Oh, this is going to work out well.  Like I keep saying, this guy is going to make moonbeam look like a right-winger.
@SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi You're a wimp Chucky, Pelosi is the one with real balls.
@Jamierodr10 @DGPurser Schumer is a wimp, Pelosiis the one to watch out for...she is ruthless, and relishes power.
@Sungsam12 @AOC @closmedina @KamalaHarris @DoloresHuerta @SpeakerPelosi @MichelleObama Pelosi is not in the WH.
@colliertimothy8 Drunk maybe?
@megabundance @JoeNBC Ditto
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump It won't be easy because Trump is dealing with two-faced lying hypocrites.
@JoshEva56187884 @eavesdropann @starcrosswolf He got there because 1.his name, and 2. he's aMormon.  I didn't vote for him in the primaries, but held my nose and voted for him in the general.He is in fact a RINO.
@colliertimothy8 Love it!
@EricHolder @KeepSmile912 Instead buy into leftist corruption and lies...yeah, right. Go crawl back under your rock.
@AnnCoulter When you go on the BillMaher show and start bad mouthing Trump, we're done...I'm unfollowing.
@megabundance @JoeNBC There is a big difference between Trump and Pelosi, Trump really cares about the American people, Pelosi doesn't, she is ONLY interested in power.
@megabundance @JoeNBC No, I won't unfollow him, I enjoy watching him make a complete ass out of himself too much. I won't touch the 'whipped' comment, but you're partially correct.
@AOC @closmedina @KamalaHarris @DoloresHuerta @SpeakerPelosi @MichelleObama Well coached on how to pick out communists.
@mitchellvii @lacerci65 Pelosi loves to gloat.
@HLAurora63 I wonder what she does on the side?
@JoeNBC BTW, no one gives a rat's rear what a pussy-whipped ex-RINO thinks, pal.
@JoeNBC More leftist bullshit....sigh...it never ends.
@AMike4761 @imagineworldone Finally!
@RepJeffries BULLSHIT!  The American people just got shafted!  Which was your parties goal all along....DNC, the new Communist USA Party.
@MittRomney Now you come out and support Trump by saying 'Trump called the Democrats bluff', after you just stabbed him in the back by voting with the Democrats.  RINO.
@AlCzervik5 @realDonaldTrump My hope is on him too, but I'm also a realist and I understand Pelosi.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Yep, the ignorant voters voted for you communists, no doubt, and if they have ANY common sense left, they will reject you in two years. Because you will do NOTHING GOOD for America.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump You're an idiot Swelledhead.
@okWessler5 @SealeyGerald Okay.....
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump Sadly, I agree.
@Zerogravityv0 @MsAvaArmstrong All four.
@brianstelter @KatiePavlich @hogangidley45 A hell of a lot more intelligent and accurate than anything you have reported baldy.
@SenGillibrand Maybe the most ignorant tweet of yours yet...amazingly ignorant.
@SenGillibrand The new Venezuela here we come! You're an idiot.
@ItBDead @bethlahem16 @w_terrence @realDonaldTrump Another optimist...sigh.
@rayrayh23 @bethlahem16 @w_terrence What is your definition of 'the wall?'
@mitchellvii @janfetterman I love your optimism.
@AlCzervik5 Her hatred for Trump will over ride what miniscule common sense she has left.  She just demonstrated her power in this shutdown and she wants to jam that right down Trump's throat.
@AlCzervik5 Go back and study the G.W. Bush era when Pelosi was Speaker.  She is ruthless.
@Boyd_2650 @HLAurora63 @POTUS He'll try, but some leftist federal judge will put a temporary stop on it.  Then, it will take a SCOTUS decision, but I don't have much faith in John Roberts.
@Braveheart_USA @DGPurser I'd pay to watch it a couple thousand times!
@LoriinUtah @Tia6sc @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I've been rough on him today, but I also understand that he is our only hope.  I can remember back to G.W.Bush, when we thought he would stand up to Pelosi, instead he completely caved.  Thank God Trump is not Bush!
@Bill_Weimer_ @AlCzervik5 Man, you sure underestimate Pelosi.  Sure, she MIGHT give Trump a couple billion for a barrier (not the $5B), but you better look at the small print as to how much he will have to concede to get that. If you don't see that, you don't know Pelosi.
@mgrant76308 Having had security clearances myself, this is starting to bother me.
@StuartJDekker @bethlahem16 @RepMattGaetz @SebGorka @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump You're dreaming.
@RepMattGaetz @DVail17 @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi I agree, she should.  But, she won't.  She's not done demonstrating her hatred for Trump and to teach him a lesson to NEVER shut down the government again.  Sadly, that's where we're at, and a lot of idiot voters put her there.
@marklevinshow @yogagenie Spot on!
@JamesFBuckley2 @FreedomCalling2 @LisaMei62 @mgrant76308 We'll see.
@ChuckGrassley @bethlahem16 They won't.
@katrina_wiser @_realBlackTrump This guy is turning into another Comey.
@LindseyGrahamSC @BillPLCguy Good luck.
@realnobody_1_1 @_realBlackTrump Thanks for making me puke.
@LisaMei62 @mgrant76308 I'm still on the train, but face it Trump was neutered yesterday.  It's bad enough he has to fight Pelosi, Schumer, and the leftist 'Trump hating' MSM, but he also has to fight the RINOs in the Senate. It's going to be tough.
@HLAurora63 Thank you AZ!  Assholes....
@MarkYoungTruth @davidwebbshow The Constitution means nothing to a Muslim!
@realDonaldTrump @Redtowel4 Sorry, you conceded.  Having said that I don't think you had much of a choice, especially with the RINOs in the Senate caving.  Pelosi, Schumer, fake news MSM, and the RINOs are going to make it tough to win anything of substance.
@petluvers4Trump @ReneeCarrollAZ @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats I'm going to hold you to that prediction.
@RepMarkMeadows @BillPLCguy They're not serious...not with Pelosi in charge.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump My prediction: no fair deal, no government shutdown, and some leftist judge will stop your National Emergency.  The idiot voters elected these communists and now we're all going to suffer for it.  You tried.
@IngrahamAngle @FBI Yep, justice is a oneway street in this country when it comes to protecting leftists.
@JoyAnnReid @ilyseh @Will_Bunch Yep, you leftists are the horrors all right.  Especially you leftist fake news media types.
@ilyseh Hmmmmm, it's okay to kill babies, but........
@Diehard45C @POLITICSandFUN @SpeakerPelosi She's the anti-Christ.
@buzzman888 @SpeakerPelosi She ALWAYS does!  Words mean nothing to these leftist hypocrites and liars. They have no conscience!
@KatiePavlich @colliertimothy8 Sure!  Schumer, Pelosi, and the RINOs in the Senate now run the show.  There won't be another shutdown, wall or no wall.
@WhiteHouse They won't...trust me.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump If you believe that, I've got some prime beach front property in NV I'll sell ya.  Pelosi, Schumer, and the RINOs in the Senate now run the show...Trump just got neutered. JMHO
@Phishie_Philly @darhar981 She might as well be president now, she's running the show.
@seanhannity He caved, having said that, I don't think he had a choice, especially with so many RINOs in the Senate.  Now ,the left will offer a border security pkg that includes drones and cameras (that won't catch anything), but no wall. He'll sign.
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump They want nothing, wait and see.  They're communists.
@LindseyGrahamSC @BestBrownsFan It's not a win.
@KamalaHarris @AprilDRyan Yeah, you leftist hypocrites really screwed them, no doubt about it.  You're phonier than a three dollar bill Horizontal Harris.
@brianstelter Whay do you spew bullshit and lies, baldy?
@AOC Two commies tweeting.
@SenGillibrand Yep, you and your Marxist pals defintely are a disgrace.
@SpeakerPelosi Hypocrite! Liar! Crook! Alcoholic!
@AOC Destroying America bit by bit.
@tedlieu @RepKatieHill @OversightDems Why do you have a security clearance, comrade?
@brianstelter @AprilDRyan More leftist bullshit...you spew a lot of it Stelter. Just more leftist opinion and fake news.
@tedlieu Yep, the people need to know about your corruption, especially about the corrupt liar Eric Holder.  Stop the hypocrisy, the American people aren't as stupid as you and the corrupt Holder thinks, pal.
@brianstelter More of that phony truth?
@Acosta In your dreams, or about as realistic as the bullshit in your new book.

@RepAdamSchiff But, hey, you're just fine with Hillary erasing emails, having an illegal unsecured server with classified emails, selling access, destroying evidence, taking $400K from the Russians ,destroying Blackberries and laptop harddrives,etc,etc.??!!
@RepJeffries Balh,blah,blah...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn.  Boring.
@SenKamalaHarris Tell Schumer and Pelosi, not us.
@RepAdamSchiff "This was at same time candidate Trump was publicly calling for Russia’s help in obtaining Clinton’s emails??????" You freakin' leftist moron!  IT WAS A FREAKIN' JOKE, YOU MORON!!!!!

@tedlieu @SecElaineChao @FAANews No, stay home.
@SenKamalaHarris No collusion, Horizontal Harris.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump STOP THE HYPOCRISY AND THE LIES!
@PattyMurray Keep parading out the victims, victims you and your Marxist pals created by the way, ho hum...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn.
@RepSwalwell But, hey, it's okay if a Democrat buries evidence, erases evidence, destroys evidence, lies, sells access, takes $400k from the Russians...right?  Hypocrite.
@tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Good.  No $$$ for the wall, no flights out of LaGuardia.
@RepJerryNadler @HouseDemocrats @realDonaldTrump @SenMajLdr Well, why don't you get up off your lazy fat ass and tell Pelosi to NEGOTIATE!
@KamalaHarris Well, 'horizontal Harris' do something about it, reopen the government. You know what it takes.
@tedlieu @PressSec @realDonaldTrump Blah, blah,blah...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....yawn.
@PattyMurray President Trump's political games??????  What planet do you spend most of your time on, Senator?
@IngrahamAngle Yep, he did.
@TruthFollower40 @colliertimothy8 It has never worked where tried.
I've been harping on this for several years.  Wake up America. https://t.co/PAlv6MWTpO
@ewarren Don't vote for Democrats then.
@tedlieu No collusion....get over it....smoke another joint.

@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @FBI MOST SUCCESSFUL WITCH HUNT EVER????  Did they arrest Trump? Huh?  No, they didn't, now go take some more xanax, or smoke a few more joints....you're losing it.

@SpeakerPelosi Nor do they need your temper tantrums! NEGOTIATE!
@DoingRight1 @FairyQ15 As long as the Democrats keep moving left and embracing socialism, you damn right there is going to be division.  And, if by some minscule chance we end up with another socialist as president in 2020, well, all bets are off.

@tnmynatt @DianeLong22 2 years?  How about the 8 years before that?
@RealJamesWoods Ditto!  A true face of evil.
@SteveScalise Pelosi doesn't care about these workers, nor do most of these leftist Democrats. They need a constant stream of victims to demonstrate their phony compassion.  And, the MSM is complicit in their schemes.
@RealSaavedra CNN? Nah, I'll wait to hear it (if it even happens) directly from the WH, thank you.
@tedlieu Most likely all ten apply to you.

@SenatorDurbin Yeah, right. Say it to  yourself a thousand times and maybe you will sound like you believe it.
@Acosta You are the enemy of the people!
@SenGillibrand Three swats for you, now go stand in  the corner.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump WELL, END IT THEN!!!!!!! HYPOCRITE! Oh, I forgot Pelosi is in charge.  Go ask Pelosi for your balls back.
@tedlieu @SenMarkey @POTUS Bipartisan my ass. The president shouldn't need any permission from you Marxists who could care less if this country is annilated.  BTW, you do look alot like Kim un Jong.  A close relative?
@SenFeinstein Blah, Blah, Blah....zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn.
@PattyMurray Transgenders DO NOT belong in the military....period.
@SenGillibrand Hypocrite! Liar!
@ChrisCoons So, end it!  Stop the bullshit and end it!  You know what needs to happen to open the government, so stop the hypocrisy and bullshit.
@joshscampbell @Acosta zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn.
@SpeakerPelosi The last thing federal workers need right now is you, and Schumer, denying them a paycheck and keeping the government shutdown.  Negotiate!  Compromise!  Stop the hypocrisy and lies!
@RealJamesWoods @nedryun If he did this, no Democrats would watch it, and they need to hear the president, and all the good economic news.  I now think the president has the high ground and it puts the shutdown directly in Pelosi's lap.
@ewarren All three of them?
@KamalaHarris Blah, blah, blah...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn.
@RepMeuser @PatCaruthers1 Communists!
@SanJoaquins @SFBayFerry I wouldn't travel to, or spend a nickel in CA!
@CoryBooker Well, if you really cared about these workers, you would tell Pelosi and Schumer to Negotiate and reach a compromise. The dirty little truth is you, and your Marxist pals, don't really care. Can you spell H-Y-P-O-C-R-I-T-E!
@amyklobuchar Well, what do you expect? You Marxists won't open the government.
@Evan_Rosenfeld @brianstelter @harperbooks @Acosta Look for it in the fiction section.
@brianstelter @Acosta Acosta is going to write a book about truth in America? BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA...look for it in the fiction section.
@batalysta @Cali_Tracii @bigleaguepol Lock her up!
@PattyMurray Blah, blah, blah...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn.
@SenFeinstein For these Californians, I'll tell you where you can find 'sympathy' in the dictionary, it's between 'shit' and 'syphilis.' You can end this shutdown, Senator, but you, and your Marxist pals Pelosi and Schumer, really don't want to.
Feds ID more than 100 Salvadoran criminals nabbed at border in ongoing migrant wave.		https://t.co/QbyW4UzTTN
@SenKamalaHarris It better include $$$ for a wall. If not, bye, bye.
@RepSwalwell If you're really worried about this, which in reality you aren't, you would tell Pelosi to COMPROMISE.
@SenJeffMerkley @ChrisMurphyCT What a crock of crap...socialist crap!  How are you going to pay for it???!!! You couldn't tax the people enough to pay for it!!!!!
@ewarren @UTLAnow Blah, blah, blah...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn.
@KamalaHarris Hypocrite! Liar! You're phonier than a three dollar bill!
@RepSwalwell As compared to Fascist Democrat leadership?
@AOC @Tea_Party_Chris @LindseyGrahamSC Idiot....zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...yawn.
@rosedixontx @kjune65 Interesting.
@gaye_gallops @LindaForAmerica This should be criminal!  What the hell is wrong with these warped leftists???!!!
@BellaInxs2 Holy crap!
@SenWarren @SecretaryRoss So?  End the shutdown!  You can do it!  Oooohhh, just what I thought, you really don't care about these workers, yep, a hypocrite to the max.
@RealJamesWoods @kjune65 It's nice that she displays her IQ number for everyone to see.
@SenKamalaHarris You, and your Marxist pals started this mess, deal with it.  God help us if a completely incompetent lying boob like you becomes presidentin 2020, it will be the last nail in the coffin of a free and prosperous America.
@ChrisMo37540912 @Sekusa1 Lock them up in Pelosi's office.
Coming to America if the ignorant voters keep electing Democrats. https://t.co/J3Lw2OC0R8
This is so true! https://t.co/VgYC6Evxfm
RT @horowitz39: Four members of the terror-supporting, Jew-hating Cortez communist party have been put on the Oversight Committee by Pelosi…
@AdamSchiff You don't fight for freedom by increasing size of government!  You, and your fellow Marxists (aka Democrats) are the REAL threat to freedom.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump That's why he's a FORMER Chief-of-Staff! 		Stop the hypocrisy! NEGOTIATE!  COMPROMISE!
@SpeakerPelosi I'd rather watch grass grow than to hear a bunch of lies and bullshit out of your Marxist mouth.
@SpeakerPelosi Stop the blatant hypocrisy,lies, and bullshit! You don't give a rat's rear about these workers, if you did you would NEGOTIATE and COMPROMISE! So stop the phony crap!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Stop the hypocrisy and bullshit. Fund the wall and reopen the government. Stop using these workers as pawns.
@KamalaHarris Stop the hypocrisy and the bullshit. You don't give a damn about those workers, they're only pawns to you, and your Marxist pals.
@BoSnerdley @CNNPolitics Sadly, she did win...Trump blinked.
@Boo3zero5 @CB618444 @CNN I wear mine with pride....and, to piss off a couple of my Democrat neighbors.
@ArizonaKayte @Truthseeker126 I'm so sick of these wimpy lefists spewing this white privilege crap!  And, if you disagree, you're a racist. I don't give a rat's rear anymore, call me a racist, a bigot, et al. I could care less, they're just words...BFD.
@dbongino I hope you are filling in for Juan Williams!
@TheJuanWilliams Watched your lies and BS on The Five last night, and you were your usual asshole self. You love to cherry pick polls and fake news facts to fit your leftist anti-Trump and anti-America narrative.
@ewarren The only future you will build for America is third world status.  You're a joke, and a very bad one.
@RMConservative ?????????
@SenCoryGardner If you're going to vote like a Democrat, become one and get the hell out of my party RINO!
@FrankLuntz @rratkinson Good one...thanks.
@RMConservative What's with all this anti-Jared stuff?  I'm curious.
@RMConservative I agree!
@smalltownandrew @POTUS He has already stated that he will give the speech after the government reopens. He blinked.
@SenWhitehouse You're gonna believe anything the fake news NYT tells you? Of course, you're a Democrat, you'll believe ANY anti-Trump story...sucker.
@KamalaHarris Stop the hypocrisy and lies!  You Democrats created this shutdown, and you can end it! It's insensitive and dishonest politicians like you that I left the Democrat Party years ago, you're all hypocrites and liars.  And, anti-American.
@PattyMurray Parade out the victims, the Democrats always do.  But, they don't tell you they created the mess.  In reality, they could care less about these victims, they're only pawns to make a political point. Pathetic.
@RepAdamSchiff So, get up off your lazy ass and tell Pelosi and Schumer to NEGOTIATE, and stop the hypocrisy and lies.
@jenniferword Look at this as a blessing, now we don't have to watch that ugly cud chewing face sitting behind the president when and where he does give his speech.
@JamesFBuckley2 Hey, look at this as a blessing, now we don't have to watch that ugly cud chewing face sitting behind the president when and where he does give the speech.
@NevadaJack2 Ask him if he has molested any young boys lately.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump It is YOU Marxist Democrats who ruined the healthcare system in this country!
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump You know, I'm really glad you did this. Because now I don't have to watch your ugly cud chewing face sitting behind our great president when he does give the SOTU speech.  Thank you.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Yep, you sure made an ass out of yourself....your usual. Hypocrite!  Liar!
@BetteMidler @HjRockwell Yep, get ready for Trump for another 4 years.  Deal with it.
@AngeleStar11 She doesn't know yet, but she just got it broke off in her ass.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump And, you should spend your time doing your job instead of tweeting bullshit.
@tedlieu You're taking the word of Cohen, a proven liar?  Says a lot about you, pal. BTW, Ed Buck says hi.
@SpeakerPelosi How petty and hypocritical you are.
@brianstelter @cspan And, Pelosi is a horse's ass.
@CoBeeJayUSA @HypocriLib Looks like the south end of a horse heading north.
@RashidaTlaib @senatemajldr McConnell is leading with compassion, it's you Marxists who are playing political games with people's lives. Stop the lies, hypocrisy, and petty politics.
@tedlieu Blah, blah, blah, zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
@HillaryClinton @IndivisibleTeam Why don't you get up off your lazy corrupt lying ass and go tell Pelosi and Schumer to stop their hypocisy and lies, and reopen the government. HYPOCRITE!
@PattyMurray Hypocrite! Liar!  NEGOTIATE!!!  COMPROMISE!!!  STOP THE BULLSHIT!
Have you ever wondered when looking at the women with signs supporting abortion on demand standing behind Gov. Cuomo, and wonder how any of them could ever get pregnant? Just curious.

@SenWhitehouse Man made climate change is a hoax.  Wake up.
@PerspicaciousXY @V_actually Sick!
@tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Get off your lazy ass and reopen it! You know what it takes.
@SenSchumer Fund the wall or it doesn't reopen.
@RL9631 @JamesBo51072455 Glad I escaped that third world state many years ago. I won't even go back and visit.
@Cocoa_Bean10 @smalltownandrew @BreitbartNews @NotreDame Blah, blah, blah...yawn.
@SenatorDurbin You created the mess, deal with it.  You know what has to be done, so get off your lazy ass and do something about it.  Stop the hypocrisy, petty politics, and bullshit.
@genemarshall51 @whatznextfolks @robjh1 @elliott_correia Spot on!  Juan Williams is the reason the 'mute' button was placed on a remote.
@JohnKerry Traitor!
@cheriseguilfoil @rratkinson ah...hmm..aahhh...er....I forgot what I was gonna say.
@SenFeinstein Aaaahhhh, parade out the victims, the democrats always do.  You Democrats created them, deal with it.
@PattyMurray Aaaahhhhh, more victims. You created them, deal with it.

@peterbakernyt @brianstelter That's your opinion, and being a reporter for the uber biased fake news NYTimes, it doesn't carry much weight.
@NYGovCuomo You should be removed from office and prosecuted!  Baby killer!
@MSNBC @Morning_Joe I think the whole Democrat Party should make a run for a 2020 presidential bid....let's beat'em all!
@jasoninthehouse @KatherineWolfr2 I watched it last night....quite moving.
@SenWhitehouse Bullshit! Leftist propaganda. I trust you Marxists as far as I can throw you.
@DFBHarvard @willbarrett_1 I agree with your assessment. That has been my opinion too. He was why 'mute' buttons were invented for remotes.
@tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Ed Buck just called, he wants to invite you to a sleepover.  You gotta pay back them big donors ya know.
@Redtowel4 Funny!
@Cooey1967 @rs2orlando True depiction of actual morons.

@annie7589 @Serremmy @AOC She's a media creation.
@marklevinshow @fibarda You were excellent!  Right on the money!
@RagingGayCons @willbarrett_1 You would....I disagree.
I was having a discussion with my daughter about what disappointment is, hers was about an incident at work, mine was 'when one tunes in to watch The Five and find that Juan Williams is not on vacation.'  That's disappointment! @TheJuanWilliams
@colliertimothy8 Neither did anyone else.
@EdKrassen @HjRockwell Good, about time....oh, and he is not foolish.
@TomSteyer @HjRockwell Transgenders DO NOT belong in the military....period.
When they lose the argument they block you, bye bye  @dreandmax
@AprilDRyan Yep, there is no need. You people don't report the real news anyway, so it's a waste of time.
@dreandmax @PattyMurray HIS IS THE ONLY ONE NEGOTIATING!!!!!! What planet do you spend most of your time on?
@dreandmax @PattyMurray BULLSHIT! Pelosi and Schumer are, get it straight!
@dreandmax @PattyMurray Okay, tell it to Pelosi and Schumer and see how much they care.
@dreandmax @PattyMurray So, tell Pelosi and Schumer and watch them do NOTHING.
@PattyMurray More leftist paraded victims....yawn.
@KamalaHarris A total waste of money....yawn.
@SenKamalaHarris No, they're pawns of you Democrats.  Stop the leftist bleeding heart BS, you (Pelosi, Schumer, et al) don't give a rat's rear about these workers, they're just pawns in your failed quest to prove a political point.  Stop the charade.
@HMLoeschMcK @beth2_k3a Only even more incompetent.
@Redtowel4 @JamesFBuckley2 These bleeding heart liberals probably think this fruitcake should be in the military too.
@Onyx_Bob @BerrinAndro Oh boy, can I ever relate to this!  I remember it well.
@Jessica_ArmyVet @SenGillibrand And, if I had my way, gays would not be be allowed in the military, nor would women be allowed to serve on ships and submarines.  Just call me old school.  Don't like my opinion...tough.
@Jessica_ArmyVet @SenGillibrand Transgenders still DO NOT belong in the military....period.
@KamalaHarris No, I don't support Marxists.
@SenatorDurbin Oooohhhh boo hoo.  Reopen the government then, you know what has to be done.    And, stop the bleeding heart leftist BS.
Hey, all you billionaire leftists (i.e., Bloomberg, Steyer, Soros, Buffet, et al) when can we expect you to start shedding your billions since your protege AOC stated it is immoral to be a billionaire...huh?  We're waiting.
@IlhanMN Transgenders Do Not belong in the military, and since when have you Muslims EVER been tolerant of transgenders and homosexuals period?
@RepCummings Oh boo hoo, get out the violins.  If you WERE REALLY concerned about these workers you would tell Pelosi to reach a COMPROMISE with Trump.   In reality, you're not concerned.
@PattyMurray Ooooohhhh shut up you broken record.
@CoryBooker Well, if you're REALLY that concerned, Cory old boy, I suggest you stroll over to Schumers office and tell him to COMPROMISE with Trump.  The dirty little truth is you aren't that concerned.
@PattyMurray Blah, blah, blah.....yawn.
@SenGillibrand Transgenders DO NOT belong in the military!  Stop trying to destroy our great military!
@ewarren BULLSHIT!  Transgenders DO NOT belong in the military, you twit!  Stop trying to destroy our great military!
@JewhadiTM @colliertimothy8 I'm sure he has been neutered.
@CoryBooker It was a good decision....get over it.
@RepJerryNadler Nobody gives a rat's rear about your bullshit statement.  Transgenders DO NOT belong in our great military, stop trying to destroy it!
@SenKamalaHarris BULLSHIT!  They don't belong in the military.  Stop trying to destroy our great military!

@TomSteyer Hey Tom old boy, you gonna forfeit your billions since your Marxist protege AOC says it's immoral to be a billionaire? Eh? Hey, this is YOUR party, pal.
@RepSwalwell @RudyGiuliani Let's cut to the chase, you're a dickhead!
@NBCPolitics @Morning_Joe Good!
@KamalaHarris Loser! You couldn't lead horse to water.
@ZionistGirl18 Whoa!
@SenatorDurbin Yawn
@HillaryClinton And, kill babies.....murderer.
@ewarren Blah, blah, blah....yawn.
@AOC The leftist bullshit from a mental midget just keeps coming.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump You Marxists love to destroy our great military! Transgenders/transvestites DO NOT belong in the military, you twit!
@KamalaHarris BULLSHIT!!!!!! They DO NOT belong in the military you twit! You leftists love to destroy our great military!
@tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Ed Buck is calling you, wants a sleep over.
@RepAdamSchiff Blah, blah, blah...more leftist bullshit from Schitt-for-brains. BTW, have you sexually assaulted any more young boys lately?

@TomSteyer @realDonaldTrump You, pal, and your Marxist pals, are what is wrong with this country.  Take your opinion, and wealth, and stick it where the sun doesn't shine.
@RealJamesWoods @AnthemRespect @Twitter What?  And, do some real investigative reporting, surely you jest.
@SenBlumenthal Shut up DaNang Dick, no one gives a rat's rear what you and your Marxist pals think.
@switcher2183 Nope. Haven't watched it in years.
@lilbulli1031 @AnthemRespect Invasion of privacy I say.  What is the percentage of false readings?
@AOC Climate change is caused by the sun (NOT MAN), and it is cyclic, you twit! Man couldn't produce the pollution one just one volcano. Stop this hoax!
@AOC It's also socialism (distribution of wealth), and socialism doesn't work, moron. You obviously didn't learn anything in your econ classes.
@JacobAWohl @kjune65 Because they're leftists....do as I say, not as I do. Hypocrites all.
@KamalaHarris Never thought I would say this, but you're right. Americans do deserve a president who will fight for them, hear them, care about them, and put them in front of their own self-interests, and we have that in Trump.

@RepJoeNeguse @senatemajldr You Democrats have NEVER done anything for the American people, except screw them!

@Truthseeker126 @fev7777777 Hard to get laid when you're uglier than sin.
@KamalaHarris For the people????????!!!!!!! That's the funniest joke I've heard today!
@tedlieu I have a dream that all Americans figure out you leftist Democrats are nothing but communists in disguise.
@Comey Since when have you ever did anything right? You are pretty good at lying though.
@RepCummings So, how come you don't practice what he preached?  Huh?
@KamalaHarris There are not enough misinformed ignorant and illegal voters to elect you.
@SenGillibrand Blah, blah, blah.....
@newmorningdew @YourServiceYW They're called Democrats.
@CongBoyle More leftist bullshit.
@RepSarbanes And, if anyone is ignorant enough to believe any of this BS, I've got some prime beach front property outside of Elko NV I'll sell ya real cheap.
@RepJeffries This is simple.		Fund the wall!
@sfpelosi Interesting that you communists take your own campaign donations from corporations....can you spell h-y-p-o-c-r-i-t-e.
@KamalaforNH @indiaarie Blah, blah, blah....just more leftist BS!
@RepSarbanes Man, the leftist BULLSHIT is really flying today!
@TeamPelosi More leftist BULLSHIT!
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump 'Dems campaigned on protecting health care, creating jobs with infrastructure &amp; rooting out corruption???!!!' BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! What a crock of crap! Just the opposite is the REAL truth.
@SpeakerPelosi Total leftist BULLSHIT!
@tedlieu @DLoesch @NRA More leftist bullshit....sigh.  Get a life will ya, freakin' moron.
@SenGillibrand @NationalAction @RAYGUNshirts Who cares?
@TheJuanWilliams @thehill @AOC More leftist gibberish from Juan....sigh.
@KamalaHarris I don't donate to, or support, morons....especially Marxist morons.
@SenatorLeahy That'll be the day if Democrats are in charge.
@DeanObeidallah @rezaaslan And, if you aren't wearing a MAGA hat you're an unpatriotic anti-American racist POS!
@catturd2 @rratkinson Ditto!
@KamalaHarris I'm surprised that you can even spell the word ' president.'
@KamalaHarris My candidate has to exhibit some leadership skills, integrity, honesty, intelligence, et al....you lack all those, and then some.
@KamalaHarris I would vote for my dog first.
@badluck_jones Dementia on display.
@SenWarren What words?  Please play the words.  As usual, you have mischaracterized what was said and done. But, then this is your norm.

@kilmeade @willbarrett_1 @SpeakerPelosi Keep it shutdown until there is $$$ for the wall.
@Wackywoman50 Ditto!
@NBCNews @Morning_Joe Just replay the Kavenaugh hearing tapes....she's dead.
@ABC @Tea_Party_Chris @GMA Ho hum, yawn, just another brain-dead Marxist who thinks they can become president with nothing but air between the ears, and who couldn't lead horse to water.
@DailyCaller She's a joke, and a very bad one.
@KamalaHarris There aren't enough idiots and ignorant voters in this country to elect you.  If by a minsicule chance I'm wrong, you would be a disaster as president....even more so than the inept, incompetent, corrupt, liar Obama.
@Morning_Joe Sounds like a shitty show.
@PattyMurray You leftists just love to parade out the victims, don't you. Well, your party sure creates enough of them.  The dirty little truth is those victims are just pawns in your game of politics...pathetic.  Stop the hypocrisy and politics!
@KamalaHarris Oh boo hoo.....COMPROMISE!  Stop the hypocrisy and bullshit!
@RepJohnYarmuth Smart teenagers, too bad you're not so smart.
@tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Mr.Lieu STFU we're tired of your same old boring bullshit response.
@RepAdamSchiff A real Speaker and Minority Leader would NEGOTIATE and COMPROMISE.  So, don't feed me this leftist bullshit Schitt-for-brains.   Stop the hypocrisy and the petty politics.
@Lrihendry @maggie805ca Amen.
@thebiologistisn @PattyMurray BULLSHIT!
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Fund the wall dumbkoff, and it will reopen.  Stop the hypocrisy and petty politics.
@PattyMurray Well, if you're really concerned about this person (which I seriously doubt) you will contact Pelosi and Schumer and tell them to compromise and reopen the government.  But, in reality, we know you Democrats don't give a rat's rear about these workers or the American people.
@SpeakerPelosi @SenateGOP And, just why won't they vote on it? Huh?  Come on now, don't lie, how come?  BECAUSE IT HAS NO $$$ FOR A WALL!!!!  There now, evil one, that wasn't so hard was it?  Stop the hypocrisy, the lies, and the petty politics!
@RepCummings You got it just backward.  NEGOTIATE!!!!  I know that is a foreign word to you Democrats, look it up in the dictionary.
@misslaneym @Ilhan And, neither do you, and your ilk make America great!
@OMGno2trump BTW, leftist.....Trump doesn't spreadvhate, slimy Democrats and the MSM spread hate. Get it straight.
@OMGno2trump Yeah, let's use some common sense. I don't ever want to hear these words come out of a Democrats biased mouth again: 'Compromise,' 'Negotiate,' and 'Walk across the aisle!'  Because thery're meaningless to a Democrat.
@tedlieu @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump WRONG!  You got the numbers just reversed, pal.  Now, for once in your miserable little Marxist life, do something right for the American people!  Stop the petty politics and hypocrisy!
@IlhanMN Resign.
@SpeakerPelosi Add $$$ for the wall, or no deal.  STOP THE PETTY POLITICS!  Stop the hypocrisy and the lying!
@SenGillibrand It would be a third world country.
@SenBlumenthal STFU DaNang Dick.
@SenatorDurbin Shut up.
@PattyMurray Commie pinkos!
@KamalaHarris Shut up.....lying POS.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump You are so phoney, and so full of shit!  Commie pinko POS.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Stick it where the sun doesn't shine, asshole.
@RepJeffries STFU Commie bastard.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Phoney!
@SpeakerPelosi Leftist BS!
@SpeakerPelosi @SenateGOP Include funding for the wall dumbkoff and they will vote on it.  COMPROMISE!!!!!!!
@SpeakerPelosi Resign! You're  an absolute embarassment!
@ewarren You leftists only reform to line your pockets or to pad the voter roles.  Phonier than a three dollar bill.
@KamalaHarris Since when have you leftist's really cared about hard working Americans?  Huh?  You leftist's always spew this BS when you're running for office, but when elected taxes go up, regulations go up, and hard working Americans get screwed.
@PattyMurray Oooooooohhh too bad.  Get out the violins.
@ChrisCoons @SenatorCarper @RepLBR @SecretarySonny Knock off the hypocrisy and politics.  NEGOTIATE!
@ChrisCoons Then get off your lazy ass and tell Schumer and Pelosi to compromise!
@SenBlumenthal You don't have any room to criticize anyone, stolen valor.
@RepJerryNadler @HouseJudiciary Tough shit.
@AOC @WhipClyburn Idiots teaching idiots.
@tedlieu @AOC @RepDebDingell @jahimes @davidcicilline @RepCartwright @Twitter The new Three Stooges.
@Tribeca @Tea_Party_Chris James Earl Jones, one of my favorite actors.  Happy Birthday.
@CoryBooker The legalization of marijuana will be one of the biggest mistakes this country could ever make, second biggest would be electing you president.  Wait 10 - 20 years and you will see the devastating effects.  It will turn a lot of potential bright minds into mush.
@AprilDRyan And, Obama bailed them out.....hmmmmmm.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @TMobile Doesn't even come close to the corruption in the Obama administration, but then that was okay with you leftists....right? Hypocrite!
@Morning_Joe @WomenForCohen Yeah, and like you Democrats don't rig polls....hypocrite.

@SenWarren Sounds good to me, I hope he follows through.  Suck it up fauxahontas.
@RepSwalwell @HouseDemocrats Oh, never mind on my last tweet, you're way too scared of Pelosi to ever confront her and tell her to end the shutdown....my bad.
@RepSwalwell @HouseDemocrats Then get off your lazy duff and end the shutdown, bigmouth.  NEGOTIATE!!!!! COMPROMISE!!!!!
@SenKamalaHarris So, this is what we can expect as leadership (failed) if you by some miniscule chance become president?  You can't lead horse to water, Senator.

@Dougs1978 @veteranmountian @BreitbartNews Meanwhile Democrats get away with saying any racist or derogatory remark they want without impunity.  When caught, they simply say they're sorry, and they are forgiven. Hypocrites!
@RepSwalwell How was Puerto Rico Congressman?  Have fun with the hookers, beach, and booze while the furloughed federal workers back home are struggling to pay their bills?  You know those workers you and Pelosi could care less about?
@RepMaxineWaters You are delusional and a great danger to society. You should be institutionalized. 'Low IQ', nah, you don't even register on the scale!
@tedlieu @UTLAnow @WeAreCTA I stand with anyone who is against Marxism (aka Democrat Party).
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Hope you choke on it.
@KamalaHarris I'd rather watch commercials than either of you leftist morons.
@RepAdamSchiff And, who pays for it?  After all you leftist Democrats never seen a tax you didn't like.

@SenKamalaHarris No $$$ for the wall, no vote!  So, get off your Marxist butt and fund the wall.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Senator Schumer it's time to stop hurting innocent people. End your shutdown now!
@AOC Oh shut up moron.
@KamalaHarris @Interior Oooooohhhhhhhere come the leftists sob stories.  The old leftist story line, bring out the victims.  But,you could end this shutdown real fast and easy, but in reality you do not want to senator.  So stop the bullshit and the politics.
@ewarren @UTLAnow Blah, blah, blah....just more of your leftist BS.  And, you would tax the hell out of CA taxpayers to pay for it, right?
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Liar. You are so phony.  You freakin' Marists don't bat an eye spending billions on your pet liberal projects, like PPH, abortion, etc., but can't spend one tenth of one percent of the budget to build a wall to protect American lives.  Pathetic.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump So the Marxist says.  Just wait, you leftist morons will overreach, overtax, overspend, and the GOP will rout you again.
All the above. https://t.co/HD3Xf8Cqxh
@PattyMurray You are so disingenuous and dishonest tweeting this bullshit.  You know how to end this shutdown, so stop the hypocrisy and the politics.  You leftist hypocrites make me sick.

@TheJuanWilliams BULLSHIT!!!!!!!!
@yogagenie @lilbulli1031 He's gonna make moonbeam look like a rightwinger.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Just more proof you Democrats don't care about the furloughed workers, or the flooding of illegals, drugs, terrorist, and criminals coming across the border.  You are only interested in making political points.  Thanks for showing the real you.
@PattyMurray Ooooooohhhhhhh get the crying towels out. What abunch of hypocrisy and leftist bullshit.  You don't really care about her or you would have negotiated a compromise by now!  Stop the politics and hypocrisy!

@BoSnerdley No.  Not even close.
@KurtSchlichter Must be a bad steak to have to put something on it.
@SenFeinstein @ReneeCarrollAZ Apples and oranges Senator.  And, you know it. Stop the hypocrisy and bullshit, fund the wall and reopen the government.
@KamalaHarris @HowardU "give Millennials all the information they need to cast an informed vote?"  I'm sure by reading the article they put a leftist bent to it.
@PattyMurray @USGS Senator, stop the hypocrisy and bullshit.  Fund the wall and reopen the government. You Democrats don't give a rat's rear about the furloughed workers, they're just pawns in your quest for political power.
Okay, the Dems don't want to fund a wall, so let's put down landmines along the border.  Trust me, they'll stop coming.

@Tony_Rock01 @kennygphotos @Trump454545 @WashingtonDCTea Because it doesn't exist!  It's a manufactured area and race.
@AylaForTrump I signed.
@suzydymna "So, why is she serving in the US Congress?"? To promote Islam and eventual domination of all religions in America, thus controlling America under Sharia Law .  When the Muslim population reaches  2.5%, the riots start.
@RepSwalwell Idiot.
@TXbonniejean @Birdle2963 @SpeakerPelosi Democrats do not like REAL facts, only leftist skewed facts.
@kaitlancollins @MsAvaArmstrong DHS Secretary says this is fake news.
@KAG4All @lilbulli1031 Sadly, we're gonna have two years of this nonsense....sigh.
@Wackywoman50 @suzydymna She represents the 13th District, which is mostly in Detroit.  Detroit, as well as SE Michigan has one one the largest Arab / Middle Eastern populations in the country.  If America doesn't learn from UK, France, Sweden soon we're in trouble.
@TheQKingdom @suzydymna It shows how many Muslims live and vote in her district....scary.
@yogagenie @buzzman888 Ain't gonna go anywhere.
@suzydymna Kinda tells you how many Muslims live and vote in her district.....scary.
@SpeakerPelosi @HouseDemocrats Just more leftist BS.  I hope any bill that comes out of this communist controlled House either dies in the Senate or is vetoed by Trump.
@KamalaHarris And, just what is this middle class tax cut?  What income levels are included? And, to use the old Democrat cliche, how will you pay for it?
@krassenstein @PaisBabyling Prove they're liars. Come on, put up or shut up.
@kylegriffin1 @PaisBabyling Yep, another leftist poll.
@TopRopeTravis @PaisBabyling @KellyannePolls She has no vote....twit.
@realTylerZed @Tomas3percenter @tedcruz @RepRooney I like it!
@doss_toni @RepAdamSchiff With these type of stupid responses, we're done.
@doss_toni @RepAdamSchiff Typical 'talk in circles' liberal....sigh.
@doss_toni @RepAdamSchiff Fencing is a barrier, right? Like a wall? Drones and cameras will not stop anyone.  BTW, Trump is not against fencing, drones, cameras, or other technology.  But, in some areas, like along the Texas border a wall is far better barrier.
@doss_toni @RepAdamSchiff Are you for open borders?
@doss_toni @RepAdamSchiff Ditto back to you!  Clueless!
@doss_toni @RepAdamSchiff Legal ones do, illegal ones suck more out of government than they contribute.  Read this: https://t.co/LpiZ8aR2mu
@doss_toni @RepAdamSchiff So, an open border is okay with you?
@doss_toni @RepAdamSchiff Yep,top Democrats voted for 700 miles of wall.  Did you read it?
@doss_toni @RepAdamSchiff BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  You're clueless, and have drank the Kool Aid.
@doss_toni @RepAdamSchiff So, what you're saying is that you're okay with open borders, illegals coming across the border at will, more illegal aliens sucking off the tit of the taxpayers,etc.? Right?
@doss_toni @RepAdamSchiff https://t.co/2OpeSqZTGf
@doss_toni @RepAdamSchiff Yep.
@doss_toni @RepAdamSchiff The top Democrats voted for a wall backin 2006 (not 2013): https://t.co/FRPuQB3Sz2
@doss_toni @RepAdamSchiff I see you can Google all the leftist sites. FYI, Trump has put more sanctions on Russia, and has been tougher on Russia than Obama.  Getting out of Syria is the right thing to do.  China is suffering under Trump's tarifs.
@Acosta Good.
@GlennFerrara @doss_toni @BrentAugustson @RepAdamSchiff ??????
@doss_toni @RepAdamSchiff The Democrats approved $46B for a wall back in 2013, so what has changed?  They're playing politics, like you they hate Trump.  It's playing politics with American lives. BTW, you still haven't answered my question of what are the Russians getting
@TitusCarpathia @RealJamesWoods Must be the sour mash whiskey.
@KamalaHarris It was a sad day for America.
@doss_toni @BrentAugustson @GlennFerrara @RepAdamSchiff Still awaiting your answer....just what are the Russians getting?
@doss_toni @BrentAugustson @GlennFerrara @RepAdamSchiff Just what are they getting?
@Suzi_Cats @RepAdamSchiff No, are you?
@ASK_des @Dawn_DeMore1 @drahus11 I like the music of the 50s and 60s and loved Roy Orbison (favorites 'Uptown'and Only The Lonely' ).  Took my moniker from the 1956 song by the Chips 'Rubber Biscuit.'
@Tweets4DJT @whatznextfolks Good one!
@gene5982 @RMConservative I too graduated Navy boot camp when I was 17, retired as CWO4 22 years later. I have always said women do not belong on ships or submarines.  Nothing against women, just that mixing genders when deployed creates many problems.
Good one! https://t.co/D0Q2iIk1ZO
@RepAdamSchiff No deal without funding for the wall....Schitt-for-brains
@HLAurora63 The communists now control the House.  God help us.
@marklevinshow Sad to see what level he has sunk to.
No deal without the wall, Senator!  @SenatorCollins
Have a nice day snowflake. https://t.co/a6BzvxXcUl
@NeilKenes Typical leftist....sigh.
@NeilKenes @RealJamesWoods @BernieSanders @SenWarren @ewarren What is it that you don't understand about the states having equal representation? Our founding fathers had the foresight to see large populus states could control election outcomes, thus the EC.  Wake up.
@NeilKenes Blah, blah, blah......
@NeilKenes @RealJamesWoods @BernieSanders @SenWarren No, I want equal representation! The current system works just fine.
@NeilKenes @RealJamesWoods @BernieSanders @SenWarren BS!  Getting rid of the EC and only the most populus states will have a say in who is elected, and smaller states will have no say.  CA, NY, et al will determine election outcomes, bad idea.
@RSCGOP @pattipromqueen AZ elects a communist.
@actlightning Commies protect commies.
@sofinique1 @G1rly_Tattooed Slimy little commie.
@RogerCaynor I like it!
@RogerCaynor @crimsonfaith88 Bring in the clowns.
So true! https://t.co/J3pral14UU
@NationalistCody @crimsonfaith88 Just try it China.
@Tweets4DJT Spot on!
@AOC Air head.
@Tweets4DJT @buzzman888 Good point.
@RealJamesWoods Well said!
@KamalaHarris Yep, do the right thing and fund the wall.
@buzzman888 @HLAurora63 @IlhanMN A sad day for America.  There is no such thing as a peaceful Muslim, just read the Quran.
@kevinkc5757 @hightow05819648 @CobaltGuy1 @pjbowles4 @rdrhwke @suprdupe @RevKeithBritt @formulalol @1badveteran @KoltenKirschke @KeithJa89343647 @ChadBLarsen @VFWd @irrepressably @Blue87090124 @less4more11 @Edgardo81525236 @olivia_weis @KteePalm @Freedom44566103 @Schabinsk @SultanOfCatnip So true!
Interesting that I get leftists blasting me about $$$ for the wall, yet they can't back up their arguement and then they block me.
@YoYosNHotSauce @SenSchumer Border security included? Please explain.  If you mean drones andc ameras that will stop NOTHING! No wall $$$ keep the government shut down.
@SenSchumer Yep, reopen the government, if you add $$$ for border security / wall.
@JamesOKeefeIII @LNW4Trump Yes, do it!
@dnadolny @AOC @SpeakerPelosi @RepJayapal @MarkPocan Cute.....snowflake.
@reimerpaul_paul @AOC @SpeakerPelosi @RepJayapal @MarkPocan Bye, bye cupcake.
@dnadolny @AOC @SpeakerPelosi @RepJayapal @MarkPocan You farted?
@reimerpaul_paul @AOC @SpeakerPelosi @RepJayapal @MarkPocan Evidently more than you.
@Sta1tOfLiberty1 @Chrisconsrv1776 @TheCptMacMillan @MLEA_Prez @marklevinshow Whoa!
@AOC @SpeakerPelosi @RepJayapal @MarkPocan Commies at work.
@RyanAFournier So true!  And, sad.
@Don_Vito_08 @magagary687 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi Because these are future Democrats.
@DrewLinzer @maggie805ca He was a RINO.
@RepJerryNadler @HouseJudiciary @VanityFair @RepCummings @RepAdamSchiff @RepMaxineWaters @RepRichardNeal Bring in the clowns.
@RepJerryNadler @HouseJudiciary @VanityFair @RepCummings @RepAdamSchiff @RepMaxineWaters @RepRichardNeal You mean you look forward to screwing the president and America....you phony.
@replouiegohmert Right on Congressman.
@RepJerryNadler @HouseJudiciary @RashidaTlaib Facts???  Come on, since when have you Democrats ever been interested in the REAL facts? Huh?
@RashidaTlaib Liar!
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump Ditto!
@RashidaTlaib Yeah, we need to rise up and get you, and your ilk, out of office!
@HLAurora63 @Truthseeker126 I agree 100% 'Obama's diversity did this.'
@KimberlyMrsRR1 @magagary687 Well said!
@Dawn_DeMore1 @magagary687 And, she will be 1/2020th president.
@Gr8AmericanMvmt @usplaymoney Surprised?  The Democrats have always been hypocrites.  Like my daddy used to say "if the Democrats ran on what they really stood for none would be elected."
@marklevinshow @Karenwilltweet RINOs!
@ArizonaKayte @Hodge16Jim @GOPChairwoman @RepFitzpatrick @HurdOnTheHill @RepJohnKatko @RepChrisSmith @RepStefanik @buzzman888 @RuthieRedSox @KAG4All @ReneeCarrollAZ @AnnaApp91838450 @lilbulli1031 @LadyRedWave @Truthseeker126 @Dawn_DeMore1 @girl4_trump I did.  RINOs all of them.
@AOC I wouldn't want to be as ignorant and uneducated as you...okay?
@grandmainct @AOC Referring to the airhead Cortez.
@grandmainct @AOC I wouldn't want to be as ignorant and uneducated as you...okay?
@yogagenie @Karenwilltweet @gatewaypundit Now they remove them, after an election!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump No, he should not. This is a Democrat shutdown.   No $$$ for border security/wall, no reopning government.
@RightHookUSA @Hodge16Jim Her, and that Cortez airhead, the crowning jewels of the new Democrat Party.
@drudgefeed She's a commie pinko like the majority of Democrats.
@JohnDepasqual13 @Hodge16Jim Ditto!
@RashidaTlaib Truth????!!!!  You wouldn' trecognize the truth if it hit you between the eyes.
