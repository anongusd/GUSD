@MattxRed Police have a dangerous job. There are bad people out there that are a danger to the community, and police are supposed to stop them. A split second is all it takes for them to get killed, so they always prepare for the worst case scenario.
@MattxRed This is a tragic story, and running from police shouldn't be a death sentence.		But if you're in a situation like this, where it's low visibility, you should comply with officers. If you think they abused their power, fight it after the fact. It's not worth losing your life over.
@MattxRed Watch the video, it's chaos. 		- it's night time		- #StephonClark was fleeing instead of complying 		- he had a phone pointed at them, again at night time		- when shooting begins, officers don't know who is shooting. They shot rapidly, fearing for their lives
@tampa1_ @432hzFreq @TedTalevski Even if Trump inherited a downward trend, we all heard he was going to crash the economy with his policies. Now the claim is that Obama takes all the credit. 		If Trump does anything right they just move the goal posts and won't acknowledge what they said before.

@briody_tom @thecjpearson @AOC Originally it was used to describe the lowering of expectations of African Americans in education, but the same principle can be applied to any instance in which ppl treat black ppl like they're inferior and need the help of a superior class to save them.
@briody_tom @thecjpearson @AOC Even if it wasn't her idea, do you believe she isn't smart enough to realize she's being manipulated, or that she's a sell out?		This is a form of racism known as: The bigotry of low expectations.		Look it up, it's pretty fascinating.
@briody_tom @thecjpearson @AOC Is it possible she knew the inevitable token accusation would be thrown at her, but she decided to defend him anyway, because she doesn't believe he's racist?		How does this knee-jerk "token" accusation affect other black conservatives?
@briody_tom @thecjpearson @AOC If it was me, I would be incredibly insulted at people insinuating that I'm either being coerced or I'm too simple minded to realize I'm being used.		Everyone is keenly aware that anytime a black conservative speaks in defense of conservatives, people accuse them of being tokens.
@briody_tom @thecjpearson @AOC Isn't possible she came up with the idea to speak on behalf of Trump?		She's worked with him for years, and Trump &amp; his followers are constantly being accused of racism. Maybe she has an interest in defending him?
@briody_tom @thecjpearson @AOC All the talk about them being a token black conservative is pretty insulting to black conservatives. 		It implies they couldn't be acting of their own free will or they don't understand what they're a part of. To me, that's racist.
@briody_tom @thecjpearson @AOC I don't understand how a black conservative is supposed to present themselves.		What if they're proud to be conservative &amp; want to be in the public eye to break the stigma of black conservatives?		Seems like the only way they can be accepted is if they hide or don't exist.
@briody_tom @thecjpearson @AOC Progressives seem to have a hard time accepting that a black person would relate more to conservative values. 		Dems are supposed to be the party of all minorities, if a minority steps off the Dem plantation, they must be faking it, or they're too dumb to see they're being used.
@briody_tom @thecjpearson @AOC Exactly. 		I can't think of a black conservative that progressives believe is a legitimite conservative and who's not being used as a token. 		They like to point out there isn't many black conservatives, but then if you prove they exist they delegitamize them or call you racist.

@jurassic_snark_ @Ainokea88 @MarkDice @AOC House average allowance is about $1.3 million per year.		Senate average allowance is about $3.5 million per year.		This includes, "official expenses including, for example, staff, travel, mail, office 	equipment, district office rental, stationery, and other office supplies."

@crypto_eROK @deesalsa6 @marlenemendoza @JussieSmollett Why did minorities still support him up until he started his political career?		Rappers loved him. The media loved him. Then he got political and became a threat to the establishment.
@crypto_eROK @deesalsa6 @marlenemendoza @JussieSmollett I never said they still supported Jussica, but Trump has condemned bigotry numerous times.

@eknecht513 @healthierphilly I'm sorry to hear it didn't have much of an effect. I've taken 1-2 tsp of the powder (maybe 4-6 capsules) &amp; it's worked great, but everyone is different. It doesn't help so much with psychological withdrawal, but the aching, low energy, yawning, restless legs, etc. It's amazing.
@CliverRyan @udontknowB @healthierphilly You can have a bad experience with #Kratom if you are trying to take a bunch to get high. It doesn't give a high like #opiods do.		If you take kratom, stay hydrated. If you take too much, you can get a nasty headache and a dizzy feeling from being dehydrated. 		#KratomSavesLives
@CliverRyan @udontknowB @healthierphilly I'm trying to let as many ppl suffering from #opiod addiction know about #Kratom. I promise you it is unbelievable how affective it is at combating withdrawal symptoms. It's not highly addictive, and it doesn't cause the severe withdrawal that opiods do. 		Always do your research
@CliverRyan @udontknowB @healthierphilly Worth looking into #Kratom. 		Don't be fooled the fear mongering. This would change the #opioidcrisis instantly. They want to restrict it because it is a threat to #BigPharma. They'd rather you take a drug than a supplement similar to coffee. 		https://t.co/cz3N2tULU6

@maggieNYT Do you want our world to heal and move forward, or do you want a violent and traumatizing spectacle?		Think about the future. Justice will come, but feeding a lust for revenge can turn a man's heart evil. Stay grounded in truth and love. 		Much love patriots
@maggieNYT Before you shout at everyone, "NO DEALS!", ask yourself, what do you want? Do you want truth and some form of justice (Some for treason, some digging their graves, some coming clean), or do you want every single person involved to be executed? Think about that.
@maggieNYT Translation:		The intel on this is toxic. If you run with this, Trump knows who you are, and who your sources are, and he will take appropriate action. 		Now Mags and her peers have a choice. 		Go into the tunnel (no turning back, toxic train), or get off now (come clean). https://t.co/es5FlbJo0k
@maggieNYT Fast forward to recent Q drops and Maggie's tweets.		What happens when leakers (past credible sources) are given bad Intel, passed onto friendly journalists?

@maggieNYT From past Q drops and #Wikileaks reports,we know there are leakers [AS], and there are friendly journalists to conduct the narrative. 		Perhaps the "train" is the main narrative?ü§î https://t.co/dYFrCt25TW
@maggieNYT The train reference could be tied to Maggie being the conductor, giving her message to friendlies.

@seanm850 @JacobAWohl Only Q has a trip code now on the board where they post, so this isn't an issue.

Either it's legit, it's a malicious psy-op, or Trump and his team are the highest level of troll. He is the lvl 99 boss at the end of the troll dungeon.

@kevin_kevin_YES I don't get how they say it's a cult.		Whatever it is, Q isn't telling you to believe in everything they say, they want you to research &amp; think for yourself.		They openly say there's disinfo posted, so you're required to think for yourself.		Not a good cult.
@seanm850 @JacobAWohl Why hasn't the media just asked Trump? Wouldn't that put it to bed? 		Why do they devote countless articles to defame Q, but won't ask a simple question?		If microchip is Q, why not say you're going to post "x", then post it?		#AllForALARP?
@seanm850 @JacobAWohl With all the Q debunkery going on, why hasn't anyone taken a large # of #Qproofs and taken them apart?		Microchip said they could see Trump tweets early, that doesn't explain away everything else. And there's been Q posts &amp; Trump tweets separated by seconds.
@seanm850 @JacobAWohl Many of the apparent coincidences surrounding #Qanon can easily be dismissed on an individual basis. 		I'm open to the idea Q is a malicious psy-op, but I'd like to see someone investigate it wth integrity, and point by point deconstruct Q.
@seanm850 @JacobAWohl Good point.		So if you had to inform the public at large of active operations to neuter the NWO and restore justice, without tipping off bad actors, how would you do it?		Also, how did Q predict the failed terror attack in NYC?

If someone uses a phone to commit a crime, is the service provider responsible? Of course not. They don't choose how their platform is used.
@JackJacksmack @Nicole1677 @juleskitty74 @do_mer_si @andylassner @ZieglerSandi What's the difference between a platform and a publisher?		Are the laws that govern a platform different from those that govern pubs?		Are platforms responsible for the content generated?		Do pubs curate content?		Are pubs liable for their content?

@erinmangerer @teresanavarro76 @krassenstein I disagree with your statement about facts, sometimes you have to make the best judgment based on your experience and what you know.		That doesn't necessarily make your opinion invalid. Until all the facts are known, you can't really say if it's valid or not.

@erinmangerer @teresanavarro76 @krassenstein Here's a nugget of wisdom from comedian Owen Benjamin @OwenComedy that he learned from his father. 		Whatever your opinion is, if you can't argue for the other side, then you don't have a fully formed opinion.
@erinmangerer @teresanavarro76 @krassenstein I'm a real boy! Not a bot. 		Either way, insulting someone who thinks differently puts you at risk of being dismissive and close minded. Instead of attacking what you don't understand, try to understand it.
@erinmangerer @teresanavarro76 @krassenstein You can think I'm an idiot I respect that.		I think you can tell a lot about a society or culture by how polite people are in that culture.		For example, do people hurl insults at strangers who think differently than themselves?

- Use this event and the Twitter outbursts to confirm Q followers are dangerous and unhinged, with real world consequences. 		- Push for censorship!		Don't take the bait!	Don't fall for the trap!		#WWG1WGA
My take: many of the attacks on Twitter were coming from bots/shills.		Their plan:		- Create narrative that Q followers are dangerous and unhinged		- Incite Q followers to have outbursts on Twitter		- Stage event at a rally with a "Q follower"
- the night of the Pennsylvania rally, Q implies there was a plot by bad actors. As a result, USSS confiscated Q signs. The night was uneventful.		- the next day, I'm no longer being bombarded by anti-Q tweets. From non-stop attacks a day earlier, to silence.
- most of the comments seemed to be trying to incite an emotional reaction. I was called unhinged, dangerously stupid, a basement dwelling fool, etc. Most weren't looking for any constructive dialogue or insight into Q.
#Qanon #GreatAwakening #WWG1WGA		Some thoughts on the recent PR attacks:		- The days after Trump's Tampa rally, there were probably close to 100 articles written attacking Q		- at the same time, on Twitter, Q followers were flooded with trolls attacking them
@TheHorrorDude @JackPosobiec I saw that. Jack is apparently on a crusade to EXPOSE Q!!!		All that would prove is that some assholes on 4chan were really just bad actors or compromised, so Q moved to 8chan.		If they want to disprove it, say you're going to post something specific &amp; do it.

@JackPosobiec .... which would explain why Q migrated to 8chan. Q themselves said 4chan had been compromised.
@JackPosobiec I understand ppl who say they don't think Q is real. But how can you say definitively it's fake?		I follow Q but I'll admit there's no 100% concrete proof of Q's validity, just an insane amount of coincidence		I believe ppl on 4chan could've manipulated posts
@jd_gameon @Push4Contest I read an article, I believe in the Washington Post but I could be wrong, where they called #BlacksForTrump a fringe movement		Isn't that racist?		They're suggesting any black person who supports Trump is fringe.		It's inconceivable that they could like Trump

If all else fails, they are not above assassinations.		Research the Clinton body count. There's a disturbing # of ppl connected to the Clintons who have died under mysterious circumstances.

@craigthomler That's great you're participating in that. It's gross you bring it up to pat yourself on the back.
@craigthomler Correction: #VirtueSignaling
@craigthomler You gamble on making a judgement without doing any research of your own, just picking apart easy targets that I admitted could be dismissed. Good job.		What'd you think of the video? I'd bet you didn't watch it.		Regardless, you don't have to believe.
@craigthomler Good luck with your bet bud.
@craigthomler I noticed you didn't watch the video either, since I just put this up and that video is 40 minutes long. 		&amp; You're not clever to pick apart individual things and dismiss them. I said that's reasonable. 		The whole thing can be dismissed as 100 tails in a row.
@craigthomler "Oh each objective toss, dur dur dur"		Act like a real person you wouldn't take the bet. You sound like an asshole. 		I said from the beginning this thread alone won't convince you, so ppl like you wouldn't act like I said I had 100% proof.
@craigthomler Yeah I'm honest about the fact that believing in this takes a little faith. I made that pretty clear, and I wrote that intentionally for that reason. 		I'm not here to tell ppl what to think, that's not my job, it's the #MSM's job		https://t.co/GfhN8u2GeP
Even if someone willingly joins, they are required to provide blackmail material.		That way if you ever betray the conspiracy, they can destroy your character and possibly go after you with the law. Then who would believe you?
It's reasonable to question how such a vast conspiracy could survive. Surely someone would tell. 		I believe that many of our politicians &amp; other prominent public figures are frequently blackmailed. This insures silence.
@craigthomler Thank you I'll address this in the thread. Again, nobody has to believe in this. You think it's dumb, I don't blame you.
@craigthomler Sure a dozen times. Possible, very improbable. I wouldn't take that bet, but it's somewhat believable. 		How about 100 times? Do you not agree that there is a limit?		If I got tails 100 times in a row, would you think it's coincidence, or that I cheated?

All that being said, I'll remind you that this can all be dismissed as coincidence. You can believe the #MSM and authority figures that have a history are lying, have decided to finally be honest. There's no guarantee any of this will convince you.
Assuming there are bad actors working behind the scenes to engineer WWIII and a global depression, &amp; assuming Q is legit, it's fair to say they would be watching Q closely to try and gather intel.		Because of this, disinformation is necessary, as Q has said. https://t.co/YGasPxlUbT
Let's not forget about the babies in incubators lie from the 90s either, promulgated by Rep Tom Lantos of California....		Politicians and Intel officials will lie to start wars. It's big $, and great for population control. 		https://t.co/ynORNYzu6e
The #IntelligenceCommunity is not 100% pure either. There is a substantial an element of corruption especially in the CIA. Don't forget about the WMDs they lied about in order to get us into a senseless war with Iraq.		https://t.co/1NhC2aLWjv
The #MSM #FakeNews will NEVER report honestly on this. They'll cover up for the ones they truly serve, the #Corporations &amp; #SpecialInterests that control them.		These graphics are quite a few years old, and likely there is even more consolidation today. https://t.co/d8ploWvU7G
If you do not do some research on your own, you will more than likely never be convinced. Still others would be unable to accept (assuming Q is legit), due to normalcy bias and cognitive dissonance.
When faced with a massive amount of coincidences that are connected, you will have to decide for yourself if you believe in coincidence, or if it's statistically more probable that #Qanon is legit.		There far too many "#Qproofs" for me to go over all of them.
Disclaimer: Proof of #Qanon' s validity is largely based on a series of what is becoming countless coincidences. Each data point of "evidence" is easily dismissed as circumstantial. However, at a certain point, a string of connected coincidences becomes more.
Thread: This is going to be my first attempt at throwing together some research for ppl who are new to #Qanon #GreatAwakening and want somewhere to start. If nothing else this should give you a sense of where many people tracking Q's posts are coming from.
@abmoser88 @TheAnuhart @freckleyfriend @GenericRISAgent @willsommer @jc2uok @LauraLoomer You should be appreciative that I'm trying.		I'm sure you can understand how after being insulted by almost 100 strangers on Twitter in 24 hrs for following Q, I'm not very eager to try and convince you.
@abmoser88 @TheAnuhart @freckleyfriend @GenericRISAgent @willsommer @jc2uok @LauraLoomer Be patient.

@doublebville @abmoser88 @freckleyfriend @GenericRISAgent @willsommer @jc2uok @LauraLoomer This is too complex to try to convince anyone over Twitter. This is a waste of my time if ppl are expecting anyone to make the perfect case over Twitter.
@doublebville @abmoser88 @freckleyfriend @GenericRISAgent @willsommer @jc2uok @LauraLoomer I'm trying get ppl to look into it themselves. Anyone who refuses to look into something objectively is going to have a hard time being enlightened.
@idleacts @willsommer @jc2uok @LauraLoomer I'm not attacking anyone for not believing, in fact, i completely understand. I would think you were crazy to just take what I say and accept it as fact. That's why I keep begging ppl to do their own research into Q. I can't convince anyone that won't.
@idleacts @willsommer @jc2uok @LauraLoomer It is possible, I'm just expressing why I believe. You don't have to. You don't have to insult me for believing either		If nothing major happens before the midterms that exposes some of what Q has talked about, I would say I was duped and Q is a fraud
@EJRaoulduke1976 @idleacts @willsommer @jc2uok @LauraLoomer I just can't take any of you seriously. You're fake superiority because you can insult and belittle ppl on the internet is a joke. Either you're trolls or just being shitty ppl.		You sound like a bunch of elitist douche bags. It's ok to disagree and not hate.
@idleacts @willsommer @jc2uok @LauraLoomer I'm only relying on them halfway acknowledging it, they have an incentive to discredit Q because they're complicit in the power structure that's being systematically destroyed		Look up resignations of CEOs and politicians too, I know none of you will thoughüòí

@idleacts @willsommer @jc2uok @LauraLoomer I hear what your saying but how can you dismiss that much of an increase?
@idleacts @willsommer @jc2uok @LauraLoomer Of course they act like it's no big deal.
@idleacts @willsommer @jc2uok @LauraLoomer Twitter is not the place to research Q. Try Reddit or YouTube. Some ppl will deny it no matter what		Can't you look up cases and see if the defendant says sealed or something similar?		Here's a mainstream article confirming it's a lot	https://t.co/2Z2PHl0o2G
@NoIdiocracy @ChrisCaesar "I don't understand this, but I'm not even going to try because I already know it's stupid. Look how stupid these ppl are who make up their minds after doing research. They're crazy and dangerous. We need to act on pure impulse and emotion."
@idleacts @willsommer @jc2uok @LauraLoomer Your a lawyer so can't you look it up if you have a PACER account?		I don't know where you're getting your info about Q but it's not completely accurate. Probably the #MSM. Look into #OperationMockingbird
@idleacts @willsommer @jc2uok @LauraLoomer No I didn't say they're all wearing ankle monitors. And it's not daily stormer, the reference to the storm is because with what's coming it's going to be like going through a "storm". The amount of sealed indictments is unprecedented.
@NoIdiocracy @willsommer @jc2uok @LauraLoomer He received no support from Q or anyone else. Nobody encouraged his actions. Even if he follows Q, he's extremely misguided and he misses the point. We know the media will use every opportunity to make us seem violent and dangerous or low IQ. They will fail.
@EJRaoulduke1976 @idleacts @willsommer @jc2uok @LauraLoomer What exactly have I said you disagree with? Who even has such contempt for someone over Twitter? 		I sound deranged and unhinged though, right....

@idleacts @willsommer @jc2uok @LauraLoomer Totally. Most the ppl here are attacking me and disregarding what I'm saying but I'm unreasonable.
@MegaUltraMoon @freckleyfriend @GenericRISAgent @willsommer @jc2uok @LauraLoomer Again read what I've said. This is one thing. It's reasonable to be skeptical of each coincidence individually. It's foolish to look at a long series of coincidences and totally disregard them. Ask a detective.
@LauraLoomer @thedailybeast I would be skeptical of this man and supporting him. Even if he is well intentioned, his actions were misguided at best and only served to discredit followers of #Qanon #GreatAwakening. 		We need to make clear that we don't support his actions.

@EliseCLambert @freckleyfriend @GenericRISAgent @willsommer @jc2uok @LauraLoomer I would say it's fraudulent.

@freckleyfriend @GenericRISAgent @willsommer @jc2uok @LauraLoomer Would you agree that it's intellectually lazy to make a determination based only on secondhand or minimal exposure? 		You can't always depend on others to do the work for you. It makes you more susceptible to deception.
@freckleyfriend @GenericRISAgent @willsommer @jc2uok @LauraLoomer There are many more than I have presented here, and likely there are some that are better examples. Those were just off the top of my head. 		I can guarantee, if you're not going to look into this for yourself, you absolutely won't believe it.
@freckleyfriend @GenericRISAgent @willsommer @jc2uok @LauraLoomer No I agree with you. There is no single proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and you could say all of them collectively are vague enough to connect to anything, because they won't come out and say "X" is happening on this day. The choice is yours to believe.
@EliseCLambert @freckleyfriend @GenericRISAgent @willsommer @jc2uok @LauraLoomer The deadline is the midterms. If nothing starts to happen before then, I'd say Q was a fraud.
@freckleyfriend @GenericRISAgent @willsommer @jc2uok @LauraLoomer Of course.		Any rational person would be extremely skeptical when they first come across Q. You'd have to be crazy to believe all of this at first glance. But as you look into it, you will likely lean more &amp; more towards believing in Q.
@freckleyfriend @GenericRISAgent @willsommer @jc2uok @LauraLoomer Of course that's reasonable. But when there's so many of them it becomes either the greatest string of coincidences in history, or Q is legit. 		I'm trying to get you on a path to looking into it yourself. Twitter is not ideal for this.
@freckleyfriend @GenericRISAgent @willsommer @jc2uok @LauraLoomer https://t.co/eF3XBspKgY
@freckleyfriend @GenericRISAgent @willsommer @jc2uok @LauraLoomer They have to be vague because you cannot disclose confidential information.
@freckleyfriend @GenericRISAgent @willsommer @jc2uok @LauraLoomer Analysing each #Qproof on it's own it's reasonable to dismiss them. But collectively, there's so many coincidences that it ends up beginning statistically impossible.

@freckleyfriend @GenericRISAgent @willsommer @jc2uok @LauraLoomer It's Q saying how many ppl are following his posts. Not really proof, but Q has proven integrity. It could be false though. 		Go on YouTube/reddit and find an intro to Q. You'll have to look into some of this yourself. It's easier to just dismiss it.
@GenericRISAgent @RealHBoots @willsommer @jc2uok @LauraLoomer That's fine if you don't believe it. I'd prefer you don't insult me because I do.
