@davidfrum @TheAtlantic @YAppelbaum Now the "no collusion" mantra will change to "no criminal collusion from Trump himself". Not quite the same ring.
@davidaxelrod @POTUS The defense is moving the goal posts while the offense is fumbling the ball.
@washingtonpost The clock may be ticking on President Trump himself.
@SarahWFin Trump's removal should end the stalemate.
@davidfrum @realDonaldTrump He's wallowing in depression while consuming a mass quantity of days-old Big Macs.
@davidfrum Their only defense is the moving of goal posts.

@freedom_moates I like his response but "destroys" is a laughable (clickbait) description of the exchange.
@MSpicuzzaMJS More like the Trump's presidency is in crisis since only his base wants the wall.
@CNNPolitics It will take twice the air time just to fact check all the lies.
@thehill Trump holds people hostage as part of his negotiation. Even if they are Americans. No empathy.
@SarahBurris They don't care as long as he attacks people they don't like.
@CBSNews Can we get a news scroll of fact checking as he speaks?
@seanhannity MyPillow your only sponsor these days?
@kathrynw5 You'd think she would have gotten the hint after 156,000.
@thehill Twice the air time just to fact check.
@thehill More like a tyrant than a prince.
@ChuckCallesto I see American people are so willing to hand over our democracy to a reality show host who can't actually negotiate.
@thehill It's not just Federal workers who are stupid for supporting Trump. It has been bad for our country's status all over the world.
@thehill How about "hostage situation"?
Anyone believe Trump read this (or any) book this year? https://t.co/8HJe1ZXq7F
@BillKristol If only they would ban phones from the White House bathrooms, we'd have so many less mad tweetstorms.
Democrats will contribute much for border security. Just not for building a huge wall. https://t.co/WLIiIVMqo2
@RealPressSecBot They already committed billlions to border security and defense. They just dont want more wall funding.
@thehill Bullies need to coerce their "friends" to bail them out when they get pleasure into a pickle.
@CBSThisMorning If a Republican Congressman had said this about Obama, I doubt he'd say anything other than praise for that person.
@krassenstein He should call them what they are: hostages.
@SafetyPinDaily He doesn't care. He said he won't be president anymore when it all goes bust.
The president could also solve this shortly if he had any skills at politics, negotiating and democracy. Holding people hostage or trying to find loopholes around the process of governing is the only way he knows. https://t.co/EzRzGLp72z
@AndyOstroy @DalyPolitics @RashidaTlaib Let's not forget the shithole countries he talks about.
@WhiteHouse and yet the president uses a Game of Thrones meme to advertise it?
@FrogProd @Newsweek @kurtbardella I like it. Hopefully we would still have learned from this mistake.
@thehill national emergency = panic button for when Limbaugh and Coulter deride you for not doing something you haven't the negotiating skills to succeed at doing.
@thehill They didn't think a human could live so long on their burgers.
@realDonaldTrump How many are "acting" secretaries in your administration?
@mkraju As he can lie to his constituents and they will always support him, let's just let him say he built the wall already and move on.
@davidfrum @TheAtlantic An emergency is whatever Trump can't solve due to his inadequacy at democracy.
@Newsweek @kurtbardella Is there a fast-forward button on life? America under Trump's "leadership" is a circus led by a clown.
@DrDenaGrayson @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @tedlieu The president wants to be emperor, not a president.
@theblaze The Republican nomination he would. The presidency, not so much with a non-Hillary opponent.
@tedlieu And then they have to get 67 senators when Trump vetoes.
@JustinBilyj @washingtonpost The fallacy in your argument is in thinking I'm pro-Obama and even if I were, it exonerates Trump's administration.

@CNBC He'll change his tune once Trump dubs him with a funny nickname.
@thehill Trump's debates are full of lies and his followers don't care about facts. That's why he can never lose.
@RealJamesWoods I like that you only worry about one of the hundreds of people in the House.
@seanhannity Not with Republican bootlickers in Congress continuing to overlook all his bad actions.
@NBCPolitics 8 of the 13 largest single day drops in Wall Street history were in the last year. He should own up to his own volatility for that!
@realDonaldTrump 8 of the 13 biggest single day drops in Wall Street history were in 2018. Guess who is to blame for that!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @cvpayne I guess putting a casino owner with multiple bankruptcies in charge of the world's largest economy wasn't such a great idea after all.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump The Democrats already want the government 'open'. Trump wants the shutdown, and has said so repeatedly. He's not even involving himself in fixing the mess he created, so how much effort are we supposed to believe he's giving?
@thehill Republicans have gone from the party of "small government" to the party of "can't govern"

@PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump A deal to Trump is holding people hostage and then making demands for him to no longer mistreat them.

@PeteSouza I'm still wondering why dogs are so fireable.

@AnnCoulter She does.

@AnnCoulter The wall is not even a wall anymore. It is only a symbol of who holds power in government now.
@maggieNYT At this point, Trump's going to call whatever they put up as a wall (police tape, even) and claim victory.
@AshaRangappa_ Rudy doesn't mind Hillary being investigated with no reauts for several years but thinks Mueller's probe into Russian election meddling shoud wrap up on his timeline.
@Evan_Rosenfeld @vsoldatkin Putin has requests, Trump capitulates. Not much of a negotiation.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Trump got into power telling complete lies. It works for him with his base to not tell them the truths they don't want to hear.
@thehill Trump should have sold it better to the American people, especially after promising us we wouldn’t spend a dime on a wall Mexico would pay for. It feels like extortion now, and manipulative politics to lay blame for his own inability to negotiate.
@RBReich Considering the multitudinous investigations going on in every level of his business and campaign, he would be lucky just to get fired.
@Ocasio2018 The funny thing is he thinks he is making a difference by being annoying and getting attention. All he does is repulse the other side. What is gained?
@CNBC Trump must think "I'll take the mantle" for the shutdown must mean something other than what it actually means
@thehill Making America Gasp Again.
@JacksonDiehl @joshrogin Rand Paul, Kremlin-to-White House middleman
@thehill Hopefully not the Trump Foundation.
@kathrynw5 Everything is one degree of separation from him in Trump's narcissistic mind.
@thehill Boasting and BS is really all Trump has to offer anyone.
@PalmerReport Mueller is the Bo Jackson of this generation.
@DinaEllithorpe @JohnRya95081680 Stephen Moore has been a TV quack for decades. Not sure why he still is viewed as credible by anyone.
@CNBC Mueller is Bo Jackson now.
@ABCPolitics Those who don't like Michelle Obama should tell us who they admire most so the rest of us can have a good laugh.
@replouiegohmert @BreitbartNews Sure, fight for tyranny over democracy.
@thehill The president should sell the idea better to the American people before extorting us for billions he said would be 100% funded by Mexico.
@thehill Does he want more migrants?

@thehill Neither will his poll numbers, really.
@jimantle @dcexaminer Trump is not worth selling out conservative principles for.
@FaceTheNation @PressSec @CBSThisMorning @NancyPelosi Trump is only looking to protect his standing with his base. He was going to do nothing on the wall until he was cajoled into it by Coulter and Limbaugh.
@TheDemCoalition Considering his deficit spending, shutting down DJT for a week would save us billions right away.
@charliekirk11 I know many liberals and nearly all of them I've talked to are not for confiscating all guns, just better control for who gets them and how powerful they are in killing people.
@cindy_uzzell @marklevinshow I'm against their lies too. But Trump takes the cake in telling flat-out lies.
@marklevinshow Have you also tried exposing Trump's lies? It would keep you very busy.
@krassenstein "Word is, the sky is falling. And only I can fix it."
@NBCNews Given the impetus for the wall is to preserve demographics, Trump is probably happier to close the country to anyone seeking asylum south of us.
@IngrahamAngle How many within the last caravan got in without having a wall?
@BretBaier @brithume Bret, respectfully, you're one of the few disseminating actual news on that station. Its success is a sad testament to the current state of TV journalism.
@Evan_Rosenfeld As if he uses his mind for tweeting.
@jimsciutto If each lie about the wall would build a foot of it, Trump would have already built the entire length long ago.
@IngrahamAngle He was Trump-appointed. Of course he was flawed.
@CNNPolitics And, it would seem, their ticket to meet the president.
@TranslateRealDT The wall is more a monument to Trump, and his political caputulation to right-wing pundits, than it is the most effective means of securing the border.
@Evan_Rosenfeld @joshrogin And Rand Paul's ear often appears to listen to the Kremlin.
@realDonaldTrump Or we don't and enforce border security that actually works for much less.
@realDonaldTrump You need to proofread your tweets so you don't sound stupid yourself.
@NBCNews All he needed was the photo op. Then he opened his mouth for his usual boasting and BS and ruined it.
@thehill Trump confuses American interests with his own business interests, so maybe he is just delusional all around.
@CNNPolitics Sarah Sanders always tells the truth, right?
@GOP @realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo Going to multiple countries is her top qualification?
@GOP @realDonaldTrump If he really wants to keep Americans safe, he needs a better foreign policy than what he's been implementing lately.
@pmagc1 @politico I'm not a Schumer fan either but he did reluctantly offer the wall funding as part of the deal back then. Now we're at a point where neither side will compromise because their bases don't want to give up anything at all to get what they want.
@pmagc1 @politico Then this: https://t.co/n1LWyvQiBb
@pmagc1 @politico Start with this: https://t.co/MFbIU75JCU
@seanhannity Fox should also worry about their own misleading statements.
@jptrib1 Trump is the least-informed person I've ever seen claim to be an expert on statistics.
@NBCNews Trump likes the love letters he received from Kim Jong Un. Whether Kim complies is a secondary issue.
@krassenstein Trump and his history-ignorant supporters think America began when he was elected. Anything that came before is a fiction he can alter at any time.
@CNN Sticking your head out of the window is not a solution.
@thehill Trump is under the delusion that being president means getting displays of love, and punishing those who don't express it.
Your viewers will be happy to know that Trump lifted the ban on elephant trophy hunting. https://t.co/XxkexYxYJe
@MSNBC @JoeNBC Holding people captive for his own ends is what Trump does best.
@thehill The only truth Trump told this week was talking to a child on Santa not being real. He expects adults to believe all his fiction, though.
@pmagc1 @politico Schumer offered the president wall funding last January for DACA. The president initially agreed to the deal but then cancelled it after talking to hardliners, effectively tuining the deal. Now he thinks extortion of Americans is the way, instead of Mexico.
Trump is saying he only cares about people who support him. He took a vow to protect Americans, not just those who love him unconditionally. https://t.co/zgJaSB9Hz1
@CNNPolitics Of course he wants a campaign rally, not an actual show of interest for troops.
@thehill Of course Trump would turn a visit to troops as a campaign rally. It is always about him.
@politico The president hopes they do. He likes to hold suffering people hostage, even Americans, as his only bargaining chip.
@TheDemCoalition Regardless of party, which is a total  lie, they are all Americans. He took a vow for America, not just his supporters.
@MSNBC They are all Americans. The president, once a longtime Democrat, despises Americans.
@thehill Trump is the master at creating his own fictitious narratives.
@TIME Bone spur pains must have kicked in, so he left right away.
@CNN "Whatever it takes" does not mean making Mexico pay for it, as promised.
@ABCPolitics "Bone spurs" probably panicked the whole way and Melania had to snap him out of it.
@seanhannity Lesson learned: keep Trump away from Twitter and out of the country altogether.
@MSNBC @NBCNewsTHINK He's doing it wrong.
@politico Luckily even kids find Trump to be not a credible source for info.
@krassenstein He is probably constipated.
@CNNPolitics Mattis did say Trump deserved someone with his world view, so only someone with no foreign policy or military experience could actually agree with him.
@seanhannity @dbongino Why is Fox News not among the examples?
@jptrib1 Luckily we have a president he fears and will not cross. Oh wait...
@CapehartJ Bone spurs must be sensitive to combat zones.
@CNN Hide Trump's phone right now and the market may have a chance.
@WSJ It is true. Trump's policies amd tweets have had a direct effect. https://t.co/mUTmUY2OP1
@krassenstein Looks like bone spurs also keep him from visiting war zones altogether.
@CNNPolitics This is what happens when you try to do a Top Ten but have too much material to go below 41.
@jimsciutto Either the president is incompetent, or he picks advisers who are incompetent, which also makes him incompetent.
@seanhannity @SimpliSafe Not making enough money, Sean?

@DearAuntCrabby Either Trump is to blame, or Trump hires completely incompetent people, in which case, Trump is even more to blame.
@krassenstein You’re a mean Individual-1, Mr. Grinch...
@MSNBC Trump doesn’t believe in science either. His belief system only has to do with money.
@TheDemCoalition He got sub-sermoned.
@MSNBC Another Trump milestone.
@neal_katyal Trump’s the best president according to the fictional people he makes up in his own mind.
@CNN The Fed is raising rates due to Trump’s economic decisions, so he only has himself to blame.
@NBCNightlyNews Considering what he talks about when he calls them (himself), perhaps skipping an in-person visit is for the best.
@benyc Something he probably learned today.
@CNN @CNNOpinion Kudos to whoever spent countless hours of research to come up with five.
@politico She's paid to pretend she doesn't actually love them.
@bungdan @RadioFreeTom The things he claims are a disgrace are ones he is responsible for, so he only has himself to blame.
@CNBC Trump loves the poorly educated, and eith DeVos in charge of education, there will be plenty more to love in this country.
@funder You mean, "beautiful, clean coal"
@charliekirk11 Now let's hear the argument that Jesus would have supported family separation.
@TIME All around Trump are inept, so he says, but the person choosing all these inept people is not inept?

@krassenstein A fake billionaire whose business dealings are all set to be under investigation can say "poor me"
@NBCNews It is a disgrace, and he is responsible for all of them.

@mkraju Do us all a great Christmas gesture and resign.
@benyc Trump is a fan-fiction writer at heart.
@krassenstein He prefers to create all his own myths for people to believe.
@CNN Maybe Donnie should stop implementing dumb ideas to make the rates go up.
@benyc They don't raise the rates vecause they feel like it; they raise the tates because of decisions Trump and his Republican congress have been making.
@mkraju Take the hint, Donnie, on how you can get people to stop hating you too.
@PhilipRucker The military brass probably asked Trump to stay away from demoralizing troops like this in war zones from day one.
@PhilipRucker More autobiographical fan fiction from the president.
@PhilipRucker Don J. Quixote tilting at windmills yet again.
@NBCNews Another Trump milestone.
@mkraju Maybe it is a good thing for him not to visit troops in war zones after all.
@PalmerReport To be fair, he had already ruined Christmas for everyone.
@IronicDroid2 @AnnCoulter @kyleraccio @anntensity If Mitch McConnell can scale it, anyone can.
@AnnCoulter Time for an intervention.
@PalmerReport Donnie thinks a seven-year-old may be a little too old to believe in Santa Claus, yet thinks all of his myths, from Obama phonying his birth certificate to climate change being a hoax created by the Chinese, should be believed by every adult.
@cnni Guess giving the casino owner with multiple bankruptcies the biggest economy on Earth to play with wasn’t such a hot idea.
@gtconway3d I wonder how old Trump was when he stopped believing in American democracy.
@TrumpPence45 I thought Trump said it would be Mexico’s wall.
@CNBCnow @CNBC Did Mnuchin call up CEOs in Japan too?
@PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump Trumpanzees will say it's no big deal, unless Obama does it, and then it's played on Fox News 24/7
@politico Does that mean he wants a Trump Tower Turkey?
@BradMossEsq @realDonaldTrump An illegal alien shelling out merch made from outsourced labor cutting into corporate profits -- BUILD THE ROOF! #TariffTheNorthPole
@CNN Mattis did say the president deserves someone who shares his world view, so only someone with no military or foreign policy would possibly qualify for that distinction.
@krassenstein Tilting at windmills is he only strategy from Donald J. Quixote
@AngrierWHStaff @Vote4RGirls The more Trump and his minions talk, the less assured we feel.
@SkyNews Trump plans on ignoring the advice of Mattis’s replacement as well, so this will be a very smooth transition.
@joshscampbell @jdawsey1 He’ll get a memo from David Dennison
@TrumpPence45 Did he ask Mexico for the money yet?
@realDonaldTrump @RT_Erdogan So Erdogan and Putin are the heads of US foreign policy now?
@AprilDRyan Is he trying to get the Mexicans to pay for the wall while he's there?
@Acosta that wont come across like the Treasury is in panic mode.
@politico If Putin likes it, you can best believe Rand Paul likes it too.
@MSNBC That must have been winnowed down from thousands
@jdawsey1 @damianpaletta CEOs must love really-not-panicky calls from the Treasury Secretary over the holidays.
@CNN Will Donnie receive beautiful letters from Putin like he did when he and Kim Jong-un 'fell in love'?
@Phil_Mattingly @CNN Republicans need to wake up and realize that the problem is the president.
@jdawsey1 I am sure someone read it to him.
@CNN I'll make sure to add Shanahan to my White House departure bingo card.
@GlennKesslerWP Trump doesn't read anything longer than a tweet, so of course he made up hisnown fiction on what the letter contained.
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump @brett_mcgurk Trump has never visited a war zone, so of course he feels betternthan those in command on how things should be run.
@IngrahamAngle Seems pretty straightfoward to me.
@FaceTheNation @CBSDavidMartin @realDonaldTrump Trump won't listen to Mattis's replacement either, so the transition should be smooth.
@realDonaldTrump @RT_Erdogan Glad you're getting advice on American foreign policy from Turkey's dictator if you won't listen to those who actually visit war zones.
@realDonaldTrump You'll continue your tradition of ignoring Shanahan's advice, so this transition should be smooth!
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Trump only cares about keeping his base. He doesn't actually care about much that doesn't involve his own enrichment or ego.
@TeaPainUSA Hannity has been jockeying to get Melania's position.
@MeetThePress Let's not and say we did.
@maggieNYT Trump wasn't seeking advice from Mattis anymore and has no intention to so with his replacement, so it should be a very smooth transition in that regard.
@BradMossEsq Yeah, but Obama wasn't dumb or evil, so he does not represent their constituents the way Trump does.
@BillKristol @realDonaldTrump Trump creating fan fiction in his mind yet again.
@hagerhoo @FaceTheNation @CBSDavidMartin @realDonaldTrump @CBSNews Trump transition from one person he was not longer communicating with to another he won't either should be smooth in that respect.
@CapehartJ Trump acts more like he took the Mickey instead of the Mantle.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump You make a fool of yourself daily in service of the most corrupt and inept man to ever act as president.
@CBSNews let's stop apologizing and start calling him out on it.
@CNN Trump thinks justice means using the Justice Department to go after those who are investigating him for breaking the law.
@theblaze Conservative media loves to showwcase stories of people being offended, or people offended by people being offended, and yet has no real value.
@FiveThirtyEight Because Trump can't figure out how to negotiate, or honor the deals that have already been negotiated.
@chucktodd Trump's Achilles heel is his wallet.
@BenShapQuotes @benshapiro That quote almost sounds meaningful.
@AnnCoulter Why are you not insisting that Mexico pay for it since that was also central to that promise?
@joncoopertweets That tweet made for some great jockes.
@christinawilkie @stevenmnuchin1 Did Trump lose the ability to charge his phone due to the government shutdown? Why would he not tweet something himself if he wanted to?
@davidfrum @realDonaldTrump Especially since the quote attributed to Trump does not sound like anything Trump would ever say, even in his most lucid of moments.
@PhilipRucker It's not like Trump to not tweet, and Mnuchin's quote of Trump does not sound like Trump AT ALL.
@politico His golf addiction may get the better of him until he signs just about anything.
@Phil_Mattingly @stevenmnuchin1 Mnuchin's attempt to write some fan fiction doesn't sound much like Trump in his "quote"
@RealJamesWoods You should feel fortunate that the president is gutless so that right-wing zealots like you can scare him into doing whatever you want.
@WilDonnelly The foundation of America itself came from not feeling they need to give the King anything he wants. We have a president, not a king, for a reason. Glad you're standing your ground.
@RkfromNy @IngrahamAngle I gave you facts. You haven't given me anything but borderline illiterate pablum. Do you have a poll? Do you have an article? Do you have anything that can back up anything? It seems that nothing I send you will change your mind, as you're in a cult and won't shake out of it.
@RkfromNy @CBSNews Where's your source for information other than Trump's rear end?
@RkfromNy Keep deflecting. It's all you can do when you can't defend Trump.
@RkfromNy @IngrahamAngle More than a pic. Read the linked article.
@RkfromNy @IngrahamAngle Trump ended DACA. Look it up. He uses the fate of the Dreamers as a bartering chip, nothing more.
@RkfromNy @CBSNews I just showed you a poll from the very same news organization you're supposedly reading and posting comments under. Where do you get your facts from? All Ive gotten from you are typical Trump cult Obama/Hillary/Mueller talking points.
@RkfromNy You're all over the place. Why are you bringing up Mueller, Hillary, etc.?
@RkfromNy @IngrahamAngle https://t.co/n1LWyvQiBb
@RkfromNy @IngrahamAngle Schumer only took the deal off the table AFTER the president reneged.
@RkfromNy @CBSNews He maintained hundreds of times that Mexico would pay for it. Now he is trying to extort the money from the American people.
@RkfromNy @CBSNews Trump won the election with a 3 million vote deficit. Current polling shows that most Americans are opposed to building the wall. https://t.co/QiFrFd91aA
@soapfan2017 @CBSNews Trump and Schumer had already had a deal last January that would have given $25 billion for border security (including the wall). Trump canceled the deal within two hours because hard liners thought he should ask for more.
@CBSNews Once again, Trump holding people hostage as his sole bargaining chip for something he hasn't the tact or negotiating skills to work out on his own.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Republicans hate government because they have grown to be terrible at it.
@CNNPolitics @abbydphillip Trump is still too dumb to understand that Attorney General does not mean a lawyer who "fixes" the situation so he can get out of legal jams.
@loriamontgomery I wish Trump would say that about the United States...
@PalmerReport Hard to believe that two years in that Dumbp still thinks Attorney General means a lawyer hired to defend his criminal actions using the Justice Department to go after any and all accusers.
Trump is still dumb enough two years in to think that Attorney General means his personal attorney (i.e., his fixer). https://t.co/tXoZ47j9ky
@NBCNews Trump would make a better farmer than a president; it's a trade that can actually use all the manure he spouts.

@Derrick38213569 @washingtonpost You haven’t offered me anything to read but your Trump cultist opinion. We can debate the wars, but what is my issue is Trump making decisions without consulting his defense secretary, his cabinet, or his congress. They disagree while Putin and Erdogan approve of his decision.
@Derrick38213569 @washingtonpost He RESIGNED.  Trump did not scale him back. Mattis quit because of what he feels are improper and dangerous actions Trump has been taking that he cannot idly stand by and see him do.  Read his resignation letter.  https://t.co/G83xAVz0ua
@washingtonpost He wasn't loyal to Trump, he felt duty bound to stick around to try to keep Trump from ruining the world...until he realized he wouldn't be successful anymore.
@mkraju Third just this year. You would think the Congress was run by the opposing party.
@GOP @GOPChairwoman They did. Schumer and Trump had an agreement in January for $25 billion in border security including the wall. Trump reneged hours later and is now shutting down the government.
@realDonaldTrump Who sent this for Trump?
@WilDonnelly This probably explains the multiple bankruptcies.
@MeetThePress @hughhewitt @realDonaldTrump I would rather he "go home"
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Amazing how one has to jettison all free thinking to join the Cult of Trump.
@HuffPost Things are always different among free thinkers before joining the Cult of Trump.
@MSNBC I admire whoever had to go through the thousands of lies Trump told this year to winnow them down to five.
@IngrahamAngle Schumer and Trump had an agreement in January to give $25 billion for border security (including a wall) and Trump cancelled it within two hours. He has only himself to blame for this current fiasco.
@GovMikeHuckabee Huckabee, ever the Trump cultist, doesn't quite have his idol's gift for insulting others for not blindly joining the cult.
@washingtonpost It's no wonder Republicans hate government now.  They're so bad at it.
@AdamCBessinger @HuffPost GOod one. I contemplated a 'road to ruin'.
@BradMossEsq Hey, he had a deal with Schumer in January. He'll honor it until the hardliners meet with him and he inevitably cancels the deal.
@politico "Retired" should be in quotes. The man quit on principle.
@TrumpPence45 Trump doesn't trust experts over his gut.
@washingtonpost Trump said Mexico would pay for the wall. He shouldn't be able to extort the American people into paying for it now.

@jimantle Chances Are you're right, but It's Not for Me to Say.
@GlennKesslerWP They're always behind the times.
@CNBC Trump is the 'chaos president', and unfortunately that is not a winning strategy from the chaos-averse Wall Street.
@politico Trump couldn't win his own state either. #TrumpResign
@jimantle MFFGA doesn't have the same ring to it as a campaign slogan.
@USATODAY Trump said Mexico would pay for the wall. He shouldn't be allowed to extort billions of dollars from Americans to pay for it now. #TrumpResign
@NBCNews He wants to be among the elite dictators club that includes his favorites: Putin, Erdogan, Kim Jong-un, etc. #TrumpResign
@HuffPost The future Trump highway will be a burned bridge followed by a road to nowhere.
@NBCNightlyNews Trump said it best: https://t.co/0Bsmgy2djm
@jimantle A president who would rather do what Erdogan and Putin want instead of his own Defense Secretary, military, and members within his own party in Congress seems more dangerous.
@FaceTheNation @realDonaldTrump Trump said Mexico would pay for it.  He shouldn't be allowed to extort the American people to pay for it now.
@davidaxelrod That alone may fund a large percentage of the wall.
@mkraju Trump wants the shutdown because Limbaugh and Hannity touted it as the best way to achieve his ends on the wall months ago. He may have had second thoughts, but he really is all in now.
Well, I guess Trump sees the dictators of the world as who he would rather cozy up to than his own country. https://t.co/eZ3UYLySvt
@FaceTheNation @realDonaldTrump The man who was going to take responsibility this time, of course, can't take responsibility. Dems gave his $25 billion in a deal in January which he cancelled hours later.  How is he not to blame for not having the money now?
@RecordsBob @NBCPolitics Regardless of whether we stay or not, or what I personally feel is right, I want the president to make an informed decision. When I see Putin praising it and Mattis resigning, it makes me uneasy.
@mkraju No, the president can't stand criticism when he watches Fox, so he will do whatever their pundits say.
@MurphinDC @Emma_Dumain Trump should have stayed with the $25 billion he agreed to in January for the wall and border security so we wouldn't be at this impasse now.
@RecordsBob @NBCPolitics Not necessarily about Syria. I believe the president should consult with his defense secretary, cabinet, and Congress for input before making decisions in matters of war, especially when there is suspicion that he has an allegiance with Putin and his interests.
@PressSec There are Republicans unaware?
@NBCPolitics Congress will finally have to step up to lead in the absence of anyone in the White House to stem Donnie's worst impulses.
@IngrahamAngle Definitely not a Trump tweet.
@washingtonpost The president doesn't care about nature unless there are golf holes around.
@CNBC Read it because the president, who claimed that Mattis was leaving due to retirement, likely didn't.
@livelygames @brithume I'm sure she felt that way. Worst choice between two candidates for president I can recall.
@livelygames @brithume Hillary was far from the best. She was the DNC pick and they made sure she won the nomination.
@NewDay @ChrisCoons If Trump wants a Defense Secretary who shares his world view, he'll have to look outside this country.
@IngrahamAngle Dems aren't cheering. Dems are fearing a president who listens for to right-wing media pundits than his own generals on world policy.
@washingtonpost It must be hard to have a conscience in this White House.
@MollyMcKew @AshaRangappa_ Probably a contract for a chain of Trump Russia hotels.
RT @jpodhoretz: Really? Cite another SecDef who resigned over policy. I’ll wait. https://t.co/KXOwItPdIt
@CNBCnow @CNBC Enjoy that statistic while you can. Looks like we are in for a rough patch ahead.
@NewDay @RepJimBanks The president's aversion to using military in combat will inevitably result in more war.
@TimOBrien The inmates are running the asylum.
@BillKristol It was refreshing to find a source thay didn't feel that conservative values meant just being blindly following a president who ran with an R after his name. Thank you for standing up to principles over the personalities.
@bootsybootsyboo @TeaPainUSA Youre right! Too bad the ones who care enough are all leaving.
@davidfrum Never-Trump Republicans, also known as, real Republicans.
@TeaPainUSA It's time for Congress to use the 25th Amendment option.
@CNBC Another fiasco of Trump's own making. He should have taken the $25 billion for the wall the Dems offered him in January.
@Statesburr @brithume You must not have read Mattis' resignation letter closely.
@Kellyann_Dupuis @realDonaldTrump @SteveDaines You do realize that the president does all the things you are accusing me of, right?
@atlassheepdog @brithume Mailing list? How old are you?
@gtconway3d Looks like the president is happier with praise from adversaries he wants to do business with than his own defense secretary.
@realDonaldTrump @SteveDaines Another Trump cultist who doesnt believe in negotiation.
@brithume These all assume that we have a stable president. Our current president wants to make his own decisions but he is poorly read and informed. His interests are self-serving and puts American values on the back burner to hos own interests in power, ego, and financial gain.
@realDonaldTrump Donald, use your self-described ability to make a deal and not break the country whenever you can't get your way.
@brithume Especially not allies who believe in totalitarianism and moral relativism.
@CBSNews It isn't reassuring that we have a president who governs based on what Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh wants rather than the majority of Americans.
@washingtonpost He should have known better than to give him a resignation letter since he doesn't like to read. The only way the president will know the extent of what Mattis wrote is if they read it aloud on Fox &amp; Friends.
@jaketapper @StCollinson @CNN Only because we have a president who governs more by what Putin, the Saudis, and right-wing media think aboit him than what is good for American democracy.
@MSNBC Trump governs on how he is being portrayed in the media. He is a shockingly weak and dangerously stupid leader.
@USATODAY The eventual Trump highway will be a burned bridge and a road to nowhere.
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt Stay off Twitter?
@realDonaldTrump Not just the Republicans.
@realDonaldTrump Actually that is the House vote.
@realDonaldTrump People want responsible government. You had the money for your wall in January when you negotiated with Schumer and then you reneged on the deal. You are the one to blame for the current fiasco.
@realDonaldTrump You care more about political wins that whether democracy wins.
@NBCNews Only $990,000,000 to go to get to 20% of what the president says he needs.
@realDonaldTrump You’re blowing up the deficit at a historic rate. Since when did you start caring about saving money? Oh yeah, your quest to make sure we get more white immigrants into the country might have something to do with it.
@joshrogin @EarlyStart Trump is more interested in protecting his business arrangements with Putin and Saudi Arabia than in the lives of allies who helped us fight ISIS.
@mkraju Trump is in a war on the truth, even on those rare occasions he says it himself.
@realDonaldTrump The fact is the wall is a monument to ththe fact that we elected an idiot to run this country.
@christinawilkie Trump has wanted the shutdown since Limbaugh and Hannity said he should do it months ago. The president trusts radio and tv personalities who make millions making up narratives than his own country’s intel.
@peterbakernyt Trump is a liar and a demagogue, and completely at odds with the truth in all respects.
@CBSNews This is the hard-hitting news I wish more news agencies would investigate.
@washingtonpost Trump has made the world a little worse every day.
@realDonaldTrump Donald Trump should fight for American values as hard as he fights to please Putin and Saudi Arabia’s.
@BillKristol He probably also realizes that Trump values Putin’s world view more than his own military brass.
@washingtonpost Those are only the ones you know of. I am sure he has said many more than that.
@CBSNews @CBSThisMorning Concerns should grow about how Trump’s military strategy is drawing praise from Vladimir Putin.
@IngrahamAngle Trump is the one doing irreparable harm to the FBI, actually, as well as this country!
@HuffPost Making Tucker Carlson feel “poorer”
@theblaze Lou Dobbs is about as qualified as the president on matters of war, so why not have him replace Mattis. They will always agree, as they are both without common sense or conscience.
@washingtonpost Trump’s next book: “The Art of the Plea Deal”
@NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK I heard the president no longer had “adults in the room”, so maybe Mary Poppins is arriving just in time.
@politico I wish he would just take his ball and go home.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Soon enough, Trump will be behind a wall of stupid steel slats , and three other walls.  Walls, walls, walls all around that the taxpayers actually paid for.
@CNN That's below where it was before the tax cuts. Great job Trump.
@politico Republicans have finally got to do something about Putin's puppet before it is too late.
@washingtonpost Trump wanted to beef up the military budget to make sure we only use them for election stunts.
@davidaxelrod Farming is a better trade for Donnie; all the manure he spews might do some good there.
@NancyPelosi Trump is an unmitigated disaster. Three shutdowns with his own party in power. God help us all.
@yashar @peterjhasson @IngrahamAngle It's hard to see Trump making it to June 2019 at this rate.
@jimantle @peterjhasson Trump also has people in his own party, and in his own cabinet, against him. A complete botch job all around. Putin likes it though.
@tedlieu @MattWhitaker46 @TheJusticeDept Whitaker is a hired stooge.  Curly, the stooge, by appearance.
@realDonaldTrump A pyrrhic victory. Enjoy your third shutdown with your own party in power of all branches of government.
@kaitlancollins Trump never read his daily briefs, or the Constitution (it was read TO him), so no surprise.
@realDonaldTrump Now on to going nowhere in the senate. Shutting down the government for the third time this year...Merry Christmas everyone!
@washingtonpost Trump is watching Fox &amp; Friends to figure out how to run the country.
@CBSNews A major takeaway is that the country has to relyon Donnie's gut alone to guide us, and we know what guts are usually full of.
@politico Someone who always agrees with the president, i.e., someone without a brain or conscience.
@PhilipRucker An intervention involving someone taken away in a straitjacket.
@pringle_leon @washingtonpost Trump is so 1950.
@tedlieu @CNN @MSNBC @abcnews @CBSNews @NBCNews Put him on with the SS uniform we all know he has in his closet
@washingtonpost Hurry up, Mueller.
@washingtonpost Correction: Trump can't stop listening to loudmouths at Fox News, Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter.
@IngrahamAngle Trump should look out for America the way he looks out for Putin.
@CNN If only we had Obama in the White House instead of Bad-Deal Donnie
@AliABCNews @joshrogin @SenatorHeitkamp @RepGoodlatte @ABC GoodLatte should change his name to BadAmericano
@timkaine @realDonaldTrump Trump's oft-used tactic has been to hold people hostage as a bargaining chip - DACA, family separation, etc. He has no morals and needs to go.
@politico Lots of manure he has been dishing out the last two years.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @VP @SecretarySonny He has plenty of manure that the ag community cam tap into.
@DuckCommanderPR @theblaze Borders aren't open, and there are better and nore economical ways to secure it than a monument to idiocy.
@TeaPainUSA Trump sure delivers plenty of manure for farming!
@GovMikeHuckabee @mattgaetz @realDonaldTrump Trump had a deal for $25 billion for the wall with Chuck back in January. He canceled. Government shutdown is his own making.
@seanhannity Meanwhile, Fox News is classified as an entertainment channel.
@GovMikeHuckabee Meanwhile, Fox News isn't  even classified as journalism.
@CBSNews Trump is the best investment Putin ever made.
@mkraju Mueller will leave no Stone unturned.
@washingtonpost An "unbiased" source.
@CNBC Time for Donnie to admit he's not such a good salesman if support goes up when he stops selling it.
@AprilDRyan You cam substitute the word "insanity" for Trump in these kinds of headlines.
@CNN Guess what? America is full of racists. Sadly, the Trump presidency has emboldened them to be more public about it than they had been in recent years.
@davidfrum Trump in the Pinocchio President. A consummate liar and puppet with the mind of a child.
@CNN Outrage from the "voter fraud accusing" right is nil on this one.
@USATODAY And each side blames the other for that division.
@brithume Looks more like how screwed up our policy in regards to sanctions is.
RT @brianklaas: The Dow is currently down about 1,500 points from the day Trump signed the tax bill, almost exactly a year ago. That’s a de…
@washingtonpost Just keep Dippin' Donnie from having access to control of that money.
@CNN @jaketapper If we get rid of our crazy leader, will they get rid of theirs?
@realDonaldTrump Sounds like youre saying the Wall was a dumb idea all along.
@davidfrum From exchanging beautiful letters to "show me yours and I'll show you mine"
@BillKristol The Deplorables are making a lot of hay because they know Trump knows rhey are all he's got from total political collapse.
@washingtonpost Trump pulled out of Syria for Putin, who has just publicly praised the decision.
@TIME What's next is Trump calls Putin and asks what else he'd like him to do.
@MSNBC @chrislhayes https://t.co/GS3VV9T3lM
@realDonaldTrump Donnie is going to know what it's like to be behind a wall of steel slats soon enough.
@jimsciutto Putin's approval is the only one Donnie truly seeks.
@brithume Putin approves of Trump's decision.
@CBSNews The only presents I've heard Don give are a birthday card to Melanoa, regifted clothing to Junior, and the top floor of Trump Tower Moscow to Putin.
@realDonaldTrump I thought you said you defeated ISIS?
From beautiful love letters to, “Show me yours and I’ll show you mine.” https://t.co/UnWer8pWbE
@realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle What do you mean? You give yourself credit for everything. Except when things don’t work out.
@peterbakernyt @sgurman @aviswanatha That was all the resume he really needed for Trump to hire him.
@brianstelter Trump’s a Coulter Bolter.
@CBSNews Republicans stumbling to avert a third government shutdown with single-party power.
Keep Trump from that money. https://t.co/5pau0m1vet
@theblaze America feels less great knowing this.
@NatashaBertrand It probably sold Trump on his pick. He wants people to protect his criminality.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Pathetic, Mike. Sad end to your once promising career to undermine law enforcement in order to enable a criminal.
@ByronYork One main difference here is that the Russians did it not only to screw with elections, but also to divide Americans with getting people to protest and hate one another more.
@waltshaub @SpeakerRyan https://t.co/oI30S9uIuF
@mkraju Maybe Trump will have competitors for the 2020 Republican nomination after all.
@politico It was never a well-oiled machine; now it will be more like a well-soiled latrine.
@jaketapper I guess all it takes to win a war these days is just an announcement that you won.
@wuerker @politico ...and the horse you rode in on.
@HuffPost Fox News likes to create major news stories about the pettiest of issues.
@GovMikeHuckabee You're calling attention to an existing issue you will conveniently ignore because -- decline in ethics and morals.
@HuffPost Trump loves his belly rubs. Between that, golf, and cashing out at the neighbors expense, it's all that keeps him from just folding up shop. Guess I won't be calling.
@AnnCoulter All the hot air will melt the snow.
@seanhannity It isnt crazy given it exists in Canada and many European countries.
@CBSNews https://t.co/D55NRxgDH2
@mkraju People try to give Trump a pass for being dumb and inexperienced. Flynn has been around a long time with full understanding of rules amd laws. He knew full well he was lying and said so repeatedly under oath.
@tedlieu Juat because they work for Trump doesnt mean they're as dumb and incompetent.
@HuffPost It is cuter than Donnie
@jimsciutto Trump has gained pleasing Putin on the hopes of that hotel deal.
@Lawrence Fox News tying themselves in knots trying to find ways to keep Hillary in the news to deflect from Trump's abysmal presidency.
@CBSNews @ZekeJMiller Now conservatives can be just as colossally disappointed with the president as everyone else.
Nice that Republicans allow Trump to do things they object with solely because of party. https://t.co/C2WcjgH5ry
@DailyCaller @realDonaldTrump Trump's ability to just say things and have people automatically believe them is starting to wane.
@mollyfprince @DailyCaller @DonaldJTrumpJr But he's actually done things to earn hate.
@DailyCaller At least we can say we tried to put up someone with principles.
@JoeNBC Trump is the gift that keeps on giving for Putin.
@CNBC Trump now is being attacked from the left and the right, and he is far from a centrist.
@CNBC I guess we should have expected a casino owner would have thought he couldn't lose gambling with our economy.
@AnnCoulter Trump is making a Space Force, so at least one form of illegal aliens may be kept out.
@Lawrence @NancyPelosi Two government shutdowns and nearly a third in the same year with the same party in control of every branch of government - if that's not indicative of ineptitude, I don't know what is.
@NBCNews https://t.co/NW3XbqNdKh
@theblaze ISIS is as defeated as North Korea is denuclearized. Wish the president would stop claiming victories he will look foolish for later.

@washingtonpost Trump himself qualifies for an asylum.
@politico https://t.co/KBMYsdxPRt
@CBSNews https://t.co/ZSrkCjg7d4
@CBSNews He came in promising fiscal conservatism and ended his career with the deficit skyrocketing out of control under his watch.  Is he proud of the work he did?
@NBCNews He promised fiscal conservatism and the deficit skyrocketed under his watch. I wonder if he considers his time there a success.
@jimsciutto Donnie's behavior meets the standards for him to qualify for an asylum.
@HuffPost But the American taxpayers would be paying directly.
@politico We should just have a goodbye to the notion of fiscal conservatism.
@jjauthor @BillOReilly O'Reilly would rather kill Social Security.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Maybe you should stop giving us reasons to despise you.
@MSNBC @hardball Thanks Trump
@NBCNews Rubio should just come out and say that having a president as compromised as Trump has been a grave mistake.
@realDonaldTrump So, Syrians can now sleep better at night??
@CNBC How fitting that we have a casino owner in charge of the country's economic fate.
@CNBC We already pay for Trump to play golf half the time. Might as well just give him a permanent vacation at this point.
@seanhannity Originally it was Rubio's team.
I expect we will soon hear yet another cabinet member called the president a "moron" behind closed doors. https://t.co/gnXESbzoQJ
@jaketapper Can't wait for Trump to tell the Syrian people they can sleep better at night.
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt I need less time to waste on emails and more time to waste on tweets
Who pays for the tariffs? We do. Who pays for the tax cuts to the wealthy? We do. Why would anyone else think we wouldn't pay for his wall? https://t.co/vKWSAnJYLC

@AnnCoulter @MarkSimoneNY TMI
@NBCNews @NBCOUT Mike Lee needs to be aware that his own views are now considered radical. Maybe he should step down.
@mkraju Trump gets his marching orders steaight from Putin.
@CNNnewsroom @maxschachter No other country in the world has anywhere near the problems we do with school shootings and they don't need to arm teachers to achieve this. The solution lies elsewhere.
@seanhannity Sorry your persistent encouraging of Trump to do stupid things isn't working according to plan.
Facebook should change ita name to Nosebook for the nosy ways they nose into everyone's business. https://t.co/cCvKxX6bYm

@jimsciutto @SenJohnKennedy @CNNnewsroom Trump and his minions see any attempt at getting to the truth as "trick questions"
@abbydphillip @maggieNYT @PressSec Another "Mission Accomplished" like Trump telling us North Korea nukes are no longet a threat.
@kaitlancollins More like the next phase of pleasing Putin to ensure Trump Hotel Moscow comes to fruition.
@HuffPost With Giuliani, never trust, always verify.
@jimsciutto Putin qnd the Crown Prince must be pleased at their investment.

@GovMikeHuckabee The rats are the ones turning on the president, and Mueller is the pied piper.
