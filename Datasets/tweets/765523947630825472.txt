@JoeBiden @JamesPindell @CynthiaNixon Joe- Don't give her a platform. She's a sore loser and a troll.
The @HillaryClinton haters are out in full force. And she's not even running.
We've now had an opportunity to watch the #CohenHearing.  What should the response be?		#Election2020 #Dems #Republicans
(4) These kinds of spaces allow the fruits of reconciliation to grow as stereotypes are replaced with mutual understanding. The ministry of reconciliation calls us to keep pressing forward in love because the Kingdom of God is not complete until all are at the Table.		Amen.
(3) We can continue giving people who lack understanding the space to discern while also creating communities that are open, inclusive, and affirming of gender and sexual minorities.
@UMCGC (2) This is a painful moment for so many people, especially the thousands of queer congregants that have watched the denomination once again deny them a place at the Table of Christ. The call for inclusion is not one that demands conformity of thought or practice.
(1) The @UMCGC missed an opportunity to more fully express the depth and beauty of the Gospel. I understand the theological debates around the topics of gender, sex, and sexuality and do not particularly care to rehash them here.
@BoxerOrwell @CornerstoneChpl Jeremiah is a great book to study! The prophets always humanize Scripture.
I've watched the #CohenTestimony. The question I've got is this: what exactly have @Jim_Jordan and @MarkMeadows done? Sounds like they're attempting to use these hearings (and their odd defense of @realDonaldTrump) as a way of hiding their own misdeeds. I smell funny business.

(2) This testimony today confirms what we already knew. It‚Äôs time to come together- Republican, Democrat, and otherwise- and save our democracy. This is about love of country, not party or ideology. What we are hearing today should chill us to the bone. He believes you‚Äôre stupid.
(1) @HillaryClinton was cheated. The people of our country were cheated. @realDonaldTrump is a cheat and a con man. If you still cling to the narrative that Hillary was a bad candidate, is a corporate whore, or should be quiet... you are WRONG.

They are attacking @amyklobuchar left and right! Why? Because she terrifies them. She‚Äôs got more than rhetoric and empty promises. She‚Äôs got grit and a track record of getting things done. #Klobuchar2020 #AmyForAmerica
@RepMarkMeadows Yeah, hi. That‚Äôs not what they said. They said they want to read the full report from Mueller, not a summary written by the AG. Stop being a liar.
Once again, @JohnDelaney is on point! https://t.co/SVlnAMRCy1
@NHLogCabin @VP @HillaryClinton @BarackObama This isn't true of many people on the left. A Dem myself, I praised the Trump Administration for taking on this fight. I was surprised but absolutely thrilled they are taking on this fight. I can give credit when it's due regardless of ideological and political disagreements.
@brad_polumbo I was an extremely intelligent, mature 16 year old. Still definitely should not have voted.
@BoxerOrwell @realDonaldTrump I think we could use more civility in this country. We aren't helping if we can't acknowledge when the other side does something right. We must find those areas of common ground, and together, reach for higher ground as a united people.
I'm humble enough to give credit when it's due. Bravo to @realDonaldTrump for taking on this human rights issue. I'm extremely surprised but happy about the development. This is great news! https://t.co/AgXROPUM1S
@brad_polumbo Bravo indeed. This is wonderful news!
I don't support this President. However, this was a very well done video with solid content on the darkness socialism gives people around the world.

@BoxerOrwell @GovBillWeld Would be very interesting to see.
I'm extremely impressed with the "no-name" candidates running for President and actually think they are being underestimated. People like @amyklobuchar, @JohnDelaney, and @PeteButtigieg might just be some of the smartest and most pragmatic people in the race.

(3) We can create an America where no one is left out or left behind. We can transform the economy, rethink our education system, tackle wealth and income inequities, promote individual liberty, and make our communities safe.
(2) While representation is important and a clear sign of social progress, we must examine each candidate based on their ideas rather than making their race, gender, or sexual orientation the basis of our support or rejection. We must come together. We can come together.
(1) We must be thinking about what kind of future we want for ourselves as Americans. The next election gives us a chance to unite behind our shared goals, of which there are many. Let's identify a candidate who can capture reasonable partisans as well as the forgotten middle.
We should reform, not abolish the Electoral College. Award population-based electors to the candidate that carries each House district (no gerrymandering). Award Senate electors by giving one to the candidate that carries the state and the other to the winner of the popular vote.

@JW4Hillary @grapeloverchi @_shareyourpower @kasie @jeffzeleny @HillaryClinton Don't even try to tell me John doesn't know what he's talking about.

@JW4Hillary @grapeloverchi @_shareyourpower @kasie @jeffzeleny @HillaryClinton Thanks for brining this up. I worked in the Midwest as well and the notion that we didn't campaign here is not only wrong, it's offensive. I worked 12-hour+ days for her. And you are right, John- we beat the Obama ground game.

Do you ever spend time talking with someone that disagrees with your political views? Do you listen and seek to understand? Can you identity any common ground? Have you conceded that you might sometimes have the weaker point of view? Have they done the same? Try it out sometime.

Want to have productive conversations that make the world a better place? Give up your need to be right about everything and stop viewing those who disagree with you as evil.
Just waiting for @HillaryClinton to let us know she‚Äôll be running again... üíô
So, let's get this straight... it's perfectly fine for @JoeBiden, @BernieSanders, or @JohnKerry to talk about running in 2020 at 78 after failed bids but @HillaryClinton, who will be 72, should sit down. I wonder what the difference is... #Democrats
We're now hearing that @JeffFlake, @SenBobCorker, and @lisamurkowski believe the vote on Kavanugh should be delayed until the committee has the opportunity to hear from his accuser. Whether or not they will ultimately vote 'no' is anyone's guess. #KavanaughConfirmation

@brad_polumbo It'll be hard for a conservative to earn my vote given my views on healthcare, public education and civil rights... but if any conservative could win me over it's Sasse.
Excuse me, @GovernorKayIvey...		What is your position on healthcare? Education? Infrastructure? Anything?		The people are waiting...
It's more than clear that @GovernorKayIvey isn't mentally fit to serve. She can't answer basic questions and runs from the camera. Now we're hearing she's possibly had a stroke while in office. Who's running our government? Vote @WaltMaddox on November 6th! #aldems #alpolitics

Full disclosure: I'm a Democrat!
The @LPNational has an opportunity to become something other than the third wheel of American politics. The anti-Trump Republicans could help them win seats. I'm thinking people like @BenSasse, @JohnKasich, @BobCorker, @JeffFlake, @cindymccain, &amp; @CondoleezzaRice. Just a thought.
I‚Äôm ready for @HillaryClinton to come out swinging against @realDonaldTrump like @BarackObama did today. In fact, bring @BillClinton, @JoeBiden, and @timkaine along too! And then, run again. Please. I went to Ohio last time. I‚Äôll do it again! #StillWithHer #OneMoreTime

@tedlieu What is our next step in the #TrumpRussia situation? Is @HillaryClinton actually @POTUS? How do we make this right? #RussiaGate
@LindseyGrahamSC You called the discovery of Donald Jr.'s email disturbing. It's more than disturbing don't you think? #SmokingGun
@RepJoeKennedy Couldn't email your office because I'm not a MA4 resident. Just wanted to thank you for fighting against #Medicaid cuts.
@BernieSanders I agree that we need to stop Republicans. So, I ask, are you writing a bill or holding rallies?
The @NCGOP doesn't care about North Carolina families. It's time to hold them accountable. #VoteThemOut	https://t.co/obD4XWgBad
@houtmichael Would you care to share this new information with us? I'm genuinely curious about how you arrived at your newfound conclusions.
I wholeheartedly agree with this idea. The credit for this proposal, however, goes to Hillary Clinton as this is directly from her platform. https://t.co/a9V4wW9bKZ
@SenSanders Are you going to give Hillary Clinton credit for this idea? This is taken directly from her platform. Is it only progressive if you say it?
@HillaryClinton I know you're probably tired of hearing from people but I just wanted to say thanks for getting me politically engaged.
@TomPerez @keithellison I'm concerned we're not doing enough to stand against unchecked sexism in our party. Please stand with @NancyPelosi
@HillaryClinton @republicrestore Have almost finished my first bottle! The perfect drink for resistance conversation!

I'll remember this in 2020. Thanks @SenGillibrand ! https://t.co/bIR2GBfI7X
@realDonaldTrump You said you were going to be a President for "all people." I'm a gay man. Are you going to defend me?
@realDonaldTrump There's an orange terrorist who just became @POTUS so I expect you to fix that. Oh wait... #YouAreTheProblem
@realDonaldTrump So, will this person have read the Constitution or, like yourself, will they be pulling it out of their incompetent ass?
@realDonaldTrump I'd love to hear you back up that claim with facts. Steady job growth for 8 years.

I am proud to join @HillaryClinton in proclaiming that this is not who we are. We must reject @realDonaldTrump and his rhetoric. #MuslimBan https://t.co/scz3O6hTMQ
I remember @realDonaldTrump saying he cares about working-class people yet he continues to propose policies to the contrary. #ForkedTongue
The most benevolent @realDonaldTrump opposes abortion yet refuses to adhere to policies that lower the rate of them. SAD! #ForkedTongue
@realDonaldTrump I'd love to know how you identify as pro-life but are prepared to take away healthcare coverage from women. #ForkedTongue
@timkaine Let's remind @VP who's really pro-life. Let's propose a bill that ensures a certain quality of life for all Americans. #SaveACA
@VP Will the administration propose a bill that ensures a certain quality of life for all people since you're pro-life and all? #RestoreThat
@BernieSanders Propose a "Quality of Life Act" that ensures a certain quality of life for all and watch the @GOP run from the prolife label.
I'm guessing we would see people begin to run from the "Pro-Life" label.
Let's propose a "Quality of Life Act" whereby we mandate that all states guarantee access to healthcare, education, and housing by taxation.
It's not anti-religious to expect our communities of faith to contribute to the maintenance of the cities they dwell in. #RemoveExemptions https://t.co/61muNdFTyd

I wan everyone to remember that @SenGillibrand voted against every appointment made by Donald Trump. #DemocraticNomination2020
There are people saying that @HillaryClinton is about to make her next political move. If that's the case I'm all in. #ImStillWithHer
I will be extremely disappointed if our communities of faith do not boldly and clearly speak out against @realDonaldTrump. #FaithfullyResist
So, I'm just wondering what happened to all of this happening within the first 100 days... would @realDonaldTrump care to weigh in? https://t.co/YeSIQ1NnHk
How did the @GOP go from being the party of "tear down this wall" to a group of wall enthusiasts? #NoBanNoWall #ResistTrump #NotMyPresident
@realDonaldTrump has threatened the city of Chicago. He has chosen to be a cowardly dictator instead of a leader. SAD! #DonnieLittleHands
The @POTUS signed an order to pull us out of a trade deal that was never official. He seems to know little about the job. SAD!
The @POTUS is attempting to censor the free press! I thought this was a democracy. SAD!
@realDonaldTrump If you are so concerned about fraud I suggest you pay for a national recount in order to back up these ridiculous claims.
@realDonaldTrump Seriously, you should delete your account.
