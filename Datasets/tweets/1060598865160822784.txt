We're careful to check facts but you're right that most of Lyon is not as dense. One reason for v high density is back alleys- check out if you're interested https://t.co/ZlKJBptAS4
@VirtueofCrowds Unfortunately tall buildings are often designed around bleak plazas/open spaces because of local planning regulations or setback/right to light requirements. It is often possible to achieve greater density at fewer storeys as a result.

@HackneyYIMBY @createstreets https://t.co/dvKDDIogNf The photos were taken by us in a darkest red section (between 30,001 and 61,586 persons/sq km) or equivalent to between 78,950 and 162,068 persons/sq mile
@HackneyYIMBY @createstreets Km2 are much smaller than miles2. Lyon's 1st arrondissement has a density of 46,823 miles squared if you change it into miles2. Much of the district has offices, so the portion which is residential streets is at a much higher density than that. Hope that helps!
