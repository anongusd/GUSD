I have it recorded and had to watch it several times to make sure I heard him correctly. That’s your driver. He’s digging a bigger hole for himself by filing this false report. Possibly turning that ticket (originally) into a felony. #cantfixstupid #livepd #rcsd #blanding
@deputyblanding the boy that ran from you earlier and that you met with at the mall said that when “y’all were chasing ME sparking we’re flying”. That’s what he said his cousin told him. He admitted it was him driving during your convo with him. #livepd

@SenWhitehouse @SenatorCollins Only a matter of time before #SCOTUS overturns #RoeVWade &amp; reverses one of its worst decisions ever. Democrats support #infanticide and democrats need to be stopped before they make a law allowing more infants to be #murdered.  #Infanticide is #murder &amp; so is late term abortion.
@RepJerryNadler @RepDougCollins This wasn’t an oversight hearing. This was a Democrat controlled witch hunt into AAG Whitaker and @POTUS. There were only a couple of real oversight questions asked by Dems. Your pretext to get Whitaker to testify was misleading at best. You’re old. Resign. Hearing was a circus.
@RepSwalwell #climatechange is a hoax. But you’re right it’s time to take big and bold action on your part. #RESIGN because you’re a horrible congressman with your grandstanding.
@SteveScalise @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems clearly support #Infanticide. It’s never acceptable to #murder an infant at birth. They call it late term abortion, but it’s #murder and #infanticide.  #SCOTUS needs to overturn #RoeVWade now. Keep up the good work @SteveScalise. Best wishes.
@PattyMurray The American people are sick of you too. All you are is someone elected to Congress. You have no power as a person. Your position in Congress has power just not you. You support #infantacide and you’re a sick individual for that. You should have been aborted.
@RepMarkMeadows Green new deal aka green new dream as @SpeakerPelosi put it is dead on arrival in any house of Congress. This will never pass and if it did it would never be signed by #POTUS45. Stupidest thing I’ve ever seen a member of Congress suggest. @RepAOC @AOC is a blooming idiot.
@RepMarkMeadows I want to know what and who’s name was redacted in that memo from Rosenstein to Mueller that @Jim_Jordan asked @MattWhitaker46 about today. Investigate crimes in search of suspect not investigate subjects in search of crimes like the Special Counsel’s office is doing.
@SteveScalise Democrats are going to investigate not legislate the next 2 years. It is vital Republicans, moderates &amp; centrist re-elect #POTUS and elect Republicans to take back control of the house and keep control of senate. Otherwise this country is in real trouble. Dems ruining country.
@BarbaraBoxer That wasn’t an oversight hearing. That was a “let’s find out what Mueller has and what Whitaker has shared with the #POTUS” hearing. This was a witch hunt as much as the Special Counsel’s investigation.  That hearing was a circus because of the lame democrats. #MAGA #BuildTheWall

@grumble412 @seanhannity @BillClinton @keithellison @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @JeffFlake When @SenJohnMcCain died I had hoped some things would have changed but it didn’t. The only way I see anything changing is if the GOP gets a super majority and then that would force Dems to reach across the aisle and stop obstructing. Other than that I see no hope at this time.
@grumble412 @seanhannity @BillClinton @keithellison I agree that change is needed on both sides but as long as the @HouseDemocrats and @SenateDems continue to resist and obstruct I would not encourage @SenateGOP or @HouseGOP to reach across the aisle bc as @JeffFlake said there’s no value in it. If Dems change then I encourage it.

@grumble412 @seanhannity This isn’t a distraction. @seanhannity has been calling for this for a long time. Way before #Kavanaugh was nominated. What’s happening here is the Democrats double standards for @BillClinton and @keithellison are being exposed vs what their calling for with Brett Kavanaugh.
@lldydi @seanhannity @PresidentTrump_ The only problem with that scenario is as AG his job would end in 2-6 yrs wherefore he has a lifetime appointment to the D.C. Circuit right now. It would be stupid for him to give that up for a short-term AG job.

@thecitizeNY @seanhannity No, but his wife may be running for office again and she was a co-conspirator in the coverup in this case. U liberals want justice for Dr. Ford, but not for Clinton and Ellison accusers. #Kavanaugh already has a lifetime appointment to the 2nd highest court in the land.

@PattyMurray Now since Dr. Ford testified and was treated respectfully and with dignity by the @senjudiciary gop. The same can’t be said about how the @JudiciaryDems outed her against her will and completely dogged #Kavanaugh and assumed he was guilty. That’s how this will be remembered.

@CChristineFair Nobody fears your rage or any other women’s rage.  The only thing feared from you is your complete lack of mental stability. You truly should be committed to a mental institution and have an evaluation done. When you get well then maybe you should start tweeting again. Psycho.
@CChristineFair The only person that’s entitled in this tweet is you. You think you should be the judge jury and executioner. All white men are rapist right? You shouldn’t be anywhere near a class room, university, less long an elementary school to corrupt young kids. You need to leave the USA.

This delay of one week for an investigation by the FBI is unnecessary given the fact Democrats sat on these allegations for 6+ weeks. The investigation could have already been done if not for that. @FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump #Kavanaugh #ConfirmJudgeKavanaugh
@MelanieSpell @PenAD486 @PPact @LindseyGrahamSC @thehill Fair enough. At least you and I can agree to disagree without throwing personal insults at one another. I respect your opinion and position although we disagree.
@MelanieSpell @PenAD486 @PPact @LindseyGrahamSC @thehill Why is it sad and appalling?
@VenhausDavid @PenAD486 @PPact @LindseyGrahamSC @thehill I know Trey Gowdy personally and he’s already publicly stated that he’s not interested. He wants to return back to SC to spend time with his family.  He’ll go back to work at the Solicitors office in Spartanburg County. He’d be a good choice though.
@MelanieSpell @PenAD486 @PPact @LindseyGrahamSC @thehill After yesterday that’s probably not gonna happen and after yesterday I fully support him. He’s one of the main reasons Kavanaugh will be confirmed and that’s a great thing for the country.
@PenAD486 @PPact @LindseyGrahamSC @thehill The Muller investigation is a sham to begin with so it should be ended. It’s possible he’ll get the AG spot but I look for Trump to appoint someone else. He may appoint someone from the House rather than the Senate because of the small majority in the senate.
@BamaChi70040414 @benshapiro @thehill That’s the gods honest truth

@BamaChi70040414 @benshapiro @thehill I have no problem calling up to his office and telling him to support Kavanaugh.  He’s doing exactly what he said he wouldn’t do when he ran. He’s gonna vote down party lines just like the rest of those liberals on Capitol Hill.
@michaelmalice @RealSaavedra Trump will get to pick at least one more Justice for SCOTUS. Depending on midterm results will depend on if they’re confirmed or not. #maga #maga2020 #SCOTUS

@polititrolls @FoxNews Absolutely. He had to filibuster them otherwise they would continue to push their political narratives when this shouldn’t have been about politics. This should have been about fact finding and it wasn’t on the part of the dems.  All of these dems had their minds made up from 7/9
@polititrolls @FoxNews I’m convinced 100%. Everyone would have a range of emotions if they were wrongly accused as he is.
@PeterCraigBate1 @benshapiro No. There are two senators for each state and Alabama has 1 Democrat and 1 Republican. Alabama has 7 Congressmen in the H.O.R with 6 Republicans and 1 Democrat. It’s very much Red but purple as it relates to senators. So no it’s not a blue state, it’s red. Very red.
@polititrolls @FoxNews His performance today was one of emotions of a man wrongly accused of despicable crime. This wasn’t  some show for Trump. He’s been through hell these last 14 days. If you were an innocent man accused of the same and were in his shoes you would have done the same as him today.
@PatrickReddell @PPact @LindseyGrahamSC Agreed 100%. I was of the exact same mindset.  He’ll have my support the next time he’s up for re-election unless he completely flubs between now and then.
@polititrolls @FoxNews Democrats #searchanddestroy tactics ruined a good mans reputation. He’s innocent and that’s obvious. He didn’t go looking for this nomination. He was sought out for it. He already has a lifetime appointment to the DC Circuit. Ford is clearly lying about it being him.
@DannyBleedsBlue @cdinopoulos @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump actually accomplishes things unlike Obama. Obama set this country back decades militarily wise and went on a worldwide apology tour and made us the USA look like dumbasses. Trump puts America First, rolls back regs, creates jobs, lowered taxes, and so much more.
@PeterCraigBate1 @benshapiro It’s more like purple at the moment but make no mistake about it it won’t be purple for long. #redwaveiscoming
@wyffnews4 Even if the committee delayed the vote long enough for the FBI to complete an investigation Democrats would still oppose the nomination. The facts are in and somebody is lying and it’s not the judge. This is just a delay tactic to keep that seat open for 2 yrs. #CONFIRMKAVANAUGH

@she_fights @cdinopoulos @realDonaldTrump Nothing wrong with Alabama or Alabama rednecks, but there is something wrong with political hit jobs like the one perpetrated on Bret Kavanaugh and @realDonaldTrump. If he were in there shoes he’d want supporters like us regardless of what state we live in.
@cdinopoulos @she_fights @realDonaldTrump And what does that have to do with me?  I don’t now and nor have I ever lived in either of those states.

@Duracell switching to energizer. Should have stayed out of politics and not dropped @IngrahamAngle #IStandWithLauraIngraham #IStandWithLaura @BillOReilly @seanhannity #BoycottDuracell
@LibertyMutual I'm switching all policies with LM to another carrier since you can't stay out of politics and let a 17yr old make decisions for the company. #BoycottLibertyMutual #IStandWithLauraIngraham #IStandWithLaura @seanhannity @BillOReilly @IngrahamAngle
@DIRECTV just dropped my DTVN acct since you dropped @IngrahamAngle which was a bad move on your part. David Hogg is a puppet for the left. Directv should have stayed out of politics. #BoycottDirectTV @seanhannity @BillOReilly #IStandWithLauraIngraham #IStandWithLaura
@KAYAK I typically use this site to book flights and hotels for business and pleasure. Need a hotel this weekend as a matter of fact, but you dropped @IngrahamAngle and I'm dropping Kayak. #IStandWithLauraIngraham #IStandWithLaura @BillOReilly @seanhannity #boycottkayak
@Arbys never eating here again since you dropped @IngrahamAngle Arby's shouldn't have let 17yr old David Hogg run the company. #BoycottArbys #IStandWithLauraIngraham #IStandWithLaura @BillOReilly @seanhannity
@esurance I cancelled insurance with y'all just like y'all dropped @IngrahamAngle #boycottesurance since they let a 17 yr old David Hogg run the company. @seanhannity @BillOReilly #IStandWithLauraIngraham #IStandWithLaura

@hulu I can't believe u let a 17 yr old HS Student dictate ur wallet. A 17 yr that's being backed by Media Matters. They're using him and ur helping facilitate it. More will cancel soon. #BoycottHulu @seanhannity @BillOReilly @TuckerCarlson @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @foxandfriends
@hulu Myself &amp; my family recently cancelled our accts. No way we'll restart them ever again since u dropped advertising during @IngrahamAngle unless u change course of action. I hope more cancel too. @BillOReilly @FoxNews  @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson @foxandfriends #BoycottHulu

@PauleyP Dear Abby marathon on USA tomorrow starting at 1PM ET. Love me some #NCIS
@laceylousmith hell I'm in woodruff hauling ass to get there
@laceylousmith maybe close to 1000 ppl there now but I don't know how accurate that number is
@laceylousmith I know. Supposedly there is going to be 3 tour buses and 1 tractor trailer truck. There may be another artist showing up too
@laceylousmith Miranda Lambert is with him too
@laceylousmith will do
@laceylousmith right now there's only about 100-150 ppl in line
I don't tweet much but @blakeshelton tonight and @GeorgeStrait tomorrow night that's worth tweeting
@laceylousmith doors open at 6 and he starts playing at 8. Most ppl probably won't get there until after 5 because of work anyway.
@laceylousmith @blakeshelton they are saying only 1500-2000 ppl will be allowed in so if your going hurry up and get there. I'm on my way.
@blakeshelton at the blind horse tonight. Just in time for my birthday. I do believe I will be there
