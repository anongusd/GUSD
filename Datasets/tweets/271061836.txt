that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain; that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom; 	#VeteransDay2018 7/9

The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us, the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.	#VeteransDay2018 5/9
But in a larger sense we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our power to add or detract.	#VeteransDay2018 4/9
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.	#VeteransDay2018 3/9

@AltYelloNatPark The fundamental purpose of an election is to determine which candidate would best represent the most voters. A tied or uncontested election defeats (invalidates) its very purpose.		In the name of Democracy, either the ambiguous ballot or the whole result should be thrown out.

@martyhearty @MooreSenate Are you OK? üòØü§íüôÅ
@martyhearty @MooreSenate Uh, who's biased against Christians &amp; Jews? 		Government isn't a God to anyone, although there are those who seemingly can only see things in terms of religion. Govt is 'simply' the referee b/t conflicting rights, including religious rights.
@CruiseDeanna @MooreSenate Thomas Jefferson believed, and I agree, that educated and informed voters are necessary to the survival of democracy and the Great Experiment. There are some who say that term limits will fix the election of bad officials, but poor education &amp; false information are the problems.
@martyhearty @MooreSenate You are complaining that there is resistance to the de facto  establishment of a state religion. Religious liberty requires the government to remain neutral. When acting in their official capacity, agents of the govt must not bias their actions with their religious beliefs.
@martyhearty @MooreSenate It was not pertinent to a government official in the performance of his duties.
@CruiseDeanna @MooreSenate It seems to have been well received, and there have been a few good discussions. A lot of people have something new to think about. It's been a good day. üëå

@JesusHCristos @MooreSenate I think this is the best option. To simply not accept his oath - for cause. Bible or not. 		It's both Constitution and appropriate, in this specific case. 		I don't know if there is a precedent for it, but these are very unprecedented times.
@JesusHCristos @MooreSenate There is nothing to prevent it, but there's this: 		"Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members"	Article 1, section 5, clause 1		Ordinarily this is glossed over. But in this case there's proof that Moore has violated his oaths.
@LindaJoh11 @MooreSenate There is always a point in a society where the liberty of one conflicts with the liberty of another. They cannot both be without limit.		(FP2 = Federalist Papers #2)
@LindaJoh11 @MooreSenate On limited freedoms:	"Nothing is more certain than the indispensable necessity of government, and it is equally undeniable, that whenever and however it is instituted, the people must cede to it some of their natural rights in order to vest it with requisite powers"	John Jay, FP2
@LindaJoh11 @MooreSenate And my point is that social conservatives are basing their ideology on the Old Testament with all its patriarchy &amp; harshness. Such Christianity has contributed its share of violence, cruelty, and evil to human history.
@LindaJoh11 @MooreSenate Read the quote again.	"...which enjoins humility, piety, and benevolence; which acknowledges in every person a brother, or a sister, and a citizen with equal rights. This is genuine Christianity..."	That is New Testament Christianity, not the Old T. of the political Christians.
@xDavid_J_Savela @MooreSenate Thanks for dropping the foul language.	Are you suggesting that a religious zealot will waver in his perceived mission from God to confess his sins or negotiate democratically rather than religiously? Historically, that's not very likely.

@crazykensdotcom @MooreSenate The Constitution is the supreme social contract, the supreme Law of the Land that we all swear to live by. It is the foundation and definition of the United States of America. 		We are a democratic Republic, not a theocracy.		Fun Fact: "under God" was not in the original Pledge.
@nanakim07 @MooreSenate 'he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."'	Art 2, s1,cl8
@nanakim07 @MooreSenate Fun fact: "so help me God", added to the end of the president's oath of office, is a deviation from the Constitution.
@CalliePOTUS @natinic76 @MooreSenate The purpose of the oath itself is to convince others of the sincerity of the commitment. 	What happens when what is sacred to the oath-giver is not sacred to the witness, and vice versa? 		A problem of trust, of oath not believed.
@CalliePOTUS @natinic76 @MooreSenate The point of swearing an oath on an artifact is that the artifact represents something the oath-giver would not betray. Something sacred to the oath-giver.

@Snoopy1B1 I will, when needed. The Wall of Separation between Church and State protects us all from religious oppression, whatever the source. Tearing it down is a fool's errand.
@kevinator22 @MooreSenate It often seems like it, but not today.
@natinic76 @MooreSenate Tradition 	In the beginning, it was popularly considered proof of sincerity. 	Keith Ellison swore his oath on Thomas Jefferson's copy of the Koran. 	These days, use of the Bible has become increasingly misconstrued as an endorsement of the religion instead of the oath.
