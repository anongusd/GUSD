In fact, didn't the GOP pick up more 1st midterm Senate seats in 2018  than any 1st midterm since - Richard Nixon? Seems our 2018 pre-election  respondents sensed correctly what was coming. 4/4 	More on this debunked MSM "house vote" fable is here - https://t.co/Jhtema9UsF
"If the elections for Congress were held today, would you vote for the Republican candidate or for the Democratic candidate?" Do you see the word "house" in that question? We don't. Nor did our survey respondents hear it asked. 3/4
"Rasmussen’s last poll had the Republicans winning that vote." False. Mr. @pbump knows very well the @Rasmussen_Poll  question he's referring to is called the "Generic Congressional Ballot"  (congress still being 2 chambers - the House &amp; the Senate). It  reads as follows - 2/4
Yet again from @washingtonpost fact twister @pbump: "Rasmussen’s midterm polling, though, was far from the mark. The RealClearPolitics polling average of polls at the end of the election  estimated the Democrats would win seven percentage points more of the  house vote." 1/4

That's not a shock given the dishonest inaccurate hyper-partisan quality of their typical daily reportage &amp; "analysis." So, for the record, here again is our 2018 Midterms Generic Ballot article. To our friends in the MSM, please try using facts next time. https://t.co/cVBvoYjB4O
So, as you can see, comparing our broad inclusive national question about midterm preferences for Congress (both houses) to single chamber questions or voting in "your Congressional district" requires an explanation about how question scope differs. Readers didn't get one. 6/

Looks good except voters in 15 states this year had zero U.S. Senate races to chose from, limiting their federal election choices in their "Congressional district" to only U.S. House candidates. 15/50 = 30%  4/
So, ABC News/WaPo, just the House, no Senate? Got it.	Now CNN:	"If the elections for Congress were held today, which party's candidate would you vote for in your Congressional district, the Democratic Party's candidate or the Republican Party's candidate?" 3/
