Finally, we recently launched a podcast, where we host experts we admire and have dynamic conversations about what their work means for the future of environmentalism. Check it out: https://t.co/6lClBPFEdQ 6/7
Every year, we host an event focused specifically on the idea of Achieving Disagreement: an active form of debate that requires deep engagement on both sides. https://t.co/dook57KSJy 5/7
We also do a lot of collaborative research, like this report on Africa's potential energy revolution, commissioned by @CGDev and written by @TheBTI's @J_Lovering and three past Breakthrough Generation Fellows: https://t.co/kOBmJvmjlZ. 4/7
.@jennysplitter recently argued that feedlots are a ripe site for ethical technological innovation (https://t.co/nOXpz7wIxo). @GarrettBroad responded that technology should help us do away with feedlots altogether (https://t.co/0l3bJjncNS). 3/7
.@sapinker wrote a piece (https://t.co/b8KmYUjv8g) for the Breakthrough Journal on how the world has progressed thanks to Enlightenment values. It generated a fascinating conversation about the role of institutions and technology in societal reform (https://t.co/9lZCl65Dwq). 2/7
We at @TheBTI deeply value two-sided conversations that move beyond tribalism and into pragmatic action. We want to unstick the sticking points and come up with new, productive frameworks. Here are some of the ways we do that. 1/7
.@GarrettBroad replied: while small-scale farming might not necessarily be more ethical, we should use technology (like "clean meat") to dispense with feedlots entirely — suffering can't be fully managed, so neither pastures nor feedlots are the answer. https://t.co/0l3bJjncNS https://t.co/vUdNjFTJSf
In latest issue of @TheBTI Journal, @jennysplitter argued that feedlot beef isn't quite the ethical and environmental villain we think it is. In fact, it's an extremely productive system, and we should focus on improvement rather than elimination: https://t.co/nOXpz7wIxo https://t.co/rDPbrCHcy5

And here's the video summary: https://t.co/FJbHi5Dk7g [16/16]
For more, you can read the essay (https://t.co/jPUV5JPhQp) by Dan and Linus. Reach them on Twitter at @DanRejto and @linusblomqvist. [15/16]
Sustainable agriculture requires more efficient use of synthetic fertilizer. But it certainly does not require its elimination. [14/16]
Using so much extra land means forests are logged, habitats lost, and carbon released from trees and soil. [13/16]
In other words, to provide enough nitrogen and grow as much food as we do today, we need at least an extra Australia-sized amount of land. [12/16]
90% sounds like a lot, but closing that gap would require nearly 500 million extra acres of cropland to sustain the food supply. [11/16]
Our most optimistic scenarios find that organic methods can provide no more than 90% of the current nitrogen supply. [10/16]
That means manure, too, relies on synthetic fertilizer. Without it, we need even more land for legumes. [9/16]
Without synthetic fertilizer, that won’t work either. Both conventional and organic farmers get much of their manure from livestock that ate feed fertilized with synthetic nitrogen. [8/16]
The other nitrogen supply option? (2) Recycle it, which means applying animal manure or composted food scraps to soil. [7/16]
To increase that percentage without making any other changes means growing more legumes. Getting it to 80% requires more than double the current amount of farmland! [6/16]
This is a problem, because it would require the use of way more land. Currently, only ~20% of nitrogen comes from legumes. [5/16]
(1) Fix it: this means planting leguminous plants – think soybeans, lupine, and clover. [4/16]
Nitrogen is essential to crop growth. Without synthetic fertilizer, farmers can use two methods to supply it. [3/16]
Nitrogen pollution from fertilizers on farms is a major environmental problem, but the common proposal to get rid of fertilizers would create even worse problems. [2/16]
Organic farming (no synthetic fertilizer) is often touted as the solution to many of agriculture’s environmental impacts. [1/16]

Nitrogen is essential for plant growth. Below is the breakdown of where it comes from.

@jenn_bernstein 1. Stop urging women back to the kitchen and farm.		2. Start embracing modern arrangements, technologies, and the progress they've enabled.
@jenn_bernstein So how can environmentalism stop making life harder for women around the world?
@jenn_bernstein In developing countries, romanticizing this labor is even worse for the health and well-being of women, and prospects for their advancement.
@jenn_bernstein In the developed world, calls to spend hours preparing wholesome, home-cooked meals only add to the unpaid labor that mostly women perform.
@jenn_bernstein Modern technologies help lift burdens that fall largely to women; meanwhile, environmentalism asks women to eschew those very advances.
For those who haven't yet had a chance to read @jenn_bernstein's "On Mother Earth and Earth Mothers" in @TheBTI Journal, a few takeaways…

Renewables are impressive, but zero-carbon power in the US has barely budged in 20 years https://t.co/g4LEvY1EOz https://t.co/z6LSg3EyFp
States with renewable portfolio standards already have more nuclear than states without them https://t.co/g4LEvY1EOz https://t.co/qbIbtqhATV
Expanding RPSs into Low-Carbon Portfolio standards would more than double clean energy goals https://t.co/g4LEvY1EOz https://t.co/460DPe9w0V
