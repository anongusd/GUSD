@totofds25 So many puns, so little time David!. I think #NancyPelosi's argument that the wall is 'immoral' is nonsense, given that the #Dems supported the building of 670 miles of wall in the past 12 years. But she fought necessary battle to remind #Trump of the limits of executive power.
#Trump's Rose Garden claim that voters and federal workers 'encouraged me to keep going' with the #shutdown contradicted by more than a dozen polls: show that 7 in 10 Americans opposed shutdown and 2/3 of Americans polled disapprove of #Trump's handling of negotiations to end it. https://t.co/raaHfcKqjK
@GerCoyne There is no deal Ger! The deal is that #NancyPelosi outmanouvred him. If you read between the lines, what he seems prepared to settle for now is what the Dems originally offered. Smarter, better resourced border security but no funding for a wall.
@tominkerry Definitely was a big factor Tom but the plummeting approval ratings didn’t help either! There has been growing fear that an aviation disaster could be triggered - this would have been catastrophic for #Trump.
"If we don't get a fair deal from congress on February 15th the government will either shut down again or I will use powers afforded to me" No chance of another shutdown on February 15th given the current debacle. After 34 days of government shutdown #Trump has gained nothing.
Capitulation complete,#Trump now appears to be  laying the foundations for post February 15  declaration of national emergency on #SouthernBorder in rambling, inaccurate portrayal of human trafficking, drugs and crime related to border migration.

#Trump says he's 'proud to announce' he has reached a deal to reopen the government until February 15th. Indicates he will keep 'powerful alternative' up his sleeve.

@wadeyinred Very little I suspect Jason! I think it's just a form of waving the sword as he retreats.  'Down payment became pro-rated down payment and any minute now it;s likely to be come no 'down payment' at all! Big win for #NancyPelosi imminent. But she's won the battle, not the war.
#Trump expected to announce an end to the shutdown any minute. Everyone has assembled in Rose Garden in advance. Expected to announced end to #Shutown until February 15th. 		Wonder if timing has anything to do with a desire to distract media from #rogerstoneindictment ?? https://t.co/lcPt3hviDq
#RogerStone curiously worded indictment asks more questions than it answers.  Who is the 'senior campaign official' referenced? Only a handful of senior advisers on #Trump campaign. 7 counts of obstruction, witness tampering and false statements - relatively peripheral charges. https://t.co/jPo6b5T5Su
Congressional leaders, Trump reach tentative deal to temporarily reopen government without wall funds, according to Hill officials - The Washington Post https://t.co/0NqNpV4mvw
#Trump appears to think that 50-47 voters for the Republican Senate bill is better than 52-44 for Democrats in face off of two bills. But he strikes a more conciliatory tone in White House remarks ...says he has 'other alternatives' if government reopens with no funding for wall.
@GerCoyne Absolutely Ger. #Cohen is playing a game here too. And let's not forget that he is an admitted criminal and liar. But it is astonishing that a convicted criminal can claim (with some credibility due to Trump's pubic utterances) that he's afraid of retaliation against his family..
@swans_song 🤣😂
Is an end to the #Shutdown in sight? After six #Republican Senators voted with #Democrats today to open government and #Trump's poll numbers plummet negotiations have started that would allow the government to re-open in exchange for a 'downpayment' agreement on the wall.

@_NYJohnny_ Point taken Johnny! But drug issue is a bit of a red herring here in context of the wall as a panacea for all drug related problems. 90 per cent come in through legal points of entry. #BorderCrisis
Now #Democrats  need to respond. They need to give #Trump something that will allow both sides to return to the table without demanding his unconditional surrender first. Need to understand his position with his base, even if they wholly disagree with it.

#TrumpAddress refers to 'politicians' who build walls around their houses. Omits false claim that #BarackObama built 10 foot wall around his DC home. Predictable scaremongering and spin. No national emergency declared. Unlikely this speech will change a single mind either way.
#TrumpAddress  claims one of his aims is to safely return migrant children safely home.  Could start by returning reuniting the children and toddlers that were forcibly separated from their parents last summer after parents were deported.  Predictable spin. #BorderSecurity

Two ways a government shut down can be averted; 1) Senate amends the voting rules to require a simple majority rather than 60 votes to pass spending bill with $5 bn for border wall. 2) #Trump backs down, signs off on a short term spending bill minus his $5 bn. #GovernmentShutdown

@johnwhitearts It does feel like the chickens are coming home to roost in 2019 John. But this isn't necessarily a good thing. #Trump lashes out on the international stage when he feels cornered at home.  #JamesMattis departure, while widely expected, is a very destabilising element in this mix.

@Margaretfee Hi Margaret,  Dems will face pressure to impeach but very unlikely to succeed in Senate. #DoJ can indict #Trump if he's defeated in 2020 as statute of limitations won't have run out by then. Agree power of executive hobbles Constitution's checks and balances - blame Bush/Cheney!
@dbritton75 @MichaelCohen212 Hi Damien, politically, for Dems, endgame is to expose as much dirty laundry as possible before 2020 election. Risky gambit;  #Clinton approval ratings soared post impeachment. Legally, #Trump can be indicted if he loses or quits in 2020. And it shows POTUS is not above the law.
@AlZheimerHammer @MickMulvaneyOMB Good point Chris! But right now even  two years in  #Trumps White House must seem like a pretty daunting prospect. My take is that #Ayers thinks this ship is going down and he’s too ambitious to chain himself to the mast.

@Margaretfee Agree there is likely much more to come - Trump Jr &amp; Kusnher must be nervous. #Mueller will complete report &amp; give it to the AttGen who'll refer it to Congress.  House of Reps will decide whether to initiate impeachment proceedings. Certainly seems there will be grounds to do so.
@Huckleb10408653 @MichaelCohen212 Refer you to memo of October 16th 2000 issued by DoJ Office of Legal Counsel that concludes indicting POTUS 'would unconstitutionally undermine capacity of executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions.

@CiaranFarmer Afraid I have to agree with a lot of what you say, Ciaran. Journalists won't defend their right to ask questions because they're afraid they won't enjoy the same off the record access to Bill Shine, John Kelly and Sarah Huckabee Sanders or be called on in briefings.

@irishenergyblog That's not what I said either. But mass illegal immigration is not a problem in the US in the same way as it used to be. Of course all countries have to have borders and mechanisms to ensure legal entry. But seeking asylum is perfectly legal and is protected by international law.

@swans_song @KiethEllison I don’t have the time or desire to selectively tweet videos. So this is my last response.

@swans_song @CH_Cartoon Voters are entitled to voice concerns about a policy or appointment that impacts their lives to elected representatives. #Trump is the only politician that has encouraged violence; he's done so at his rallies. Please don't pretend #EricHolder or #MaxineWaters encourage violence.
@swans_song @CH_Cartoon Goodness Mark, you've no problem with #GOP caricatures (and your own) of sexual abuse victims and protesters as #Troublemakers #Mob #Hysterical etc. But you object to cartoons that accurately sum up Trump's phoney trade war and the suppression of corroberating statements by GOP.
@swans_song This 'rent a mob' crowd as you so revoltingly describe them is largely made up of women, a significant percentage of which are victims of sexual assault. I'm bewildered by your hostility to them and their right to protest a judge who has been credibly accused of sexual assault.
@ConanMacD @BrianKempGA @staceyabrams It is fraudulent, Conan. The suppression of voting rights amongst minorities and the very poor is #SupremeCourt sanctioned scandal.

@swans_song There is not a screed of evidence to support even one of your claims Mark. #ChristineBlaseyFord did not want to go public She was pushed into the public arena when her letter was leaked. And by the way a person who alleges sexual assault is considered a witness.
@pwwillia I wouldn't rule anything out, Patrick!  But yes, I think it's likely she'll replace @LindseyGrahamSC as Senator for South Carolina one way or the other. If Graham gets #AttGen role, Governor of S.Carolina could appoint her as replacement. If not, she could primary him anyway.
@treacyco I didn't agree with almost any of her positions Conor, but she's no lunatic. She was far more effective than #SamanthaPower. And this is a very, very savvy political move for someone with an eye on the #WhiteHouse in 2024? How many other #Cabinet members got such a warm send off?
@swans_song I think the #DNC should get rid of Ellison. But two wrongs don’t make a right. A Supreme Court appointment is the most significant a US President can make. Whether or not you believe #ChristineBlaseyFord, there is overwhelming evidence #Kavanaugh lied repeatedly under oath.

@easy5050 I agree with you completely.
@easy5050 I agree but I think it shows that there are a lot of powerful men in American politics that think sexual assault or even attempted rape is not that big a deal regardless of when and where it happens. It's not just Republicans. But I think Bush's tweet was at best unfortunate.
@easy5050 @GeorgeHWBush If he think's groping is an 'attempt at humor' as evidenced by his tweet to @SusanCollins, it appears he's not unduly concerned by claims of unwanted sexual advances.
@CiaranKilbride1 Dont think so Ciaran. Women may be more sympathetic because sexual abuse of women &amp;young girls is so prevalent &amp; their abusers are so rarely punished. 91% of rape victims in US are women. 96% of rapists of men &amp; women are men @NSVRC stats say. For every 1000 rapes: 7 convictions.
@swans_song I hope you're wrong Mark, but I suspect not. But they did defend her against #Trump's vile tirade. Such a depressing debacle. To have gone through what she did only to be disbelieved and ridiculed is beyond belief. Past time for #termlimits in the #Senate &amp; #SupremeCourt.
@swans_song Not today Mark! Her speech was entirely self-exculpatory, self-serving &amp; selective. Like her #GOP brethern, she decided  a man's word is worth more than a woman's.  And btw would you hire someone for a top job who came over the table at you in his job interview? I think not!!

@mariabyrn Thanks Maria! I do honestly believe America will rebound from this dark period. I remember the Bush/Cheney years - torture, corruption, lies, vilification of critics and economic chaos. Then Americans made history and voted in a rookie Senator as US's first black president.
@swans_song Ha! I agree completely that Manchin's vote was about self-preservation. That's what makes it so depressing. No principles, no moral compass. Just ensuring he holds onto his Senate seat, which he may well lose anyway!
Sums it up. https://t.co/Ra9J4wfoqv
@splitpot1972 @BusinessPost @SenatorCollins It's entirely political, John. #Trump had threatened #Manchin that a 'no' vote would scupper his chances of being re-elected as Senator for West Virginia, which Trump won by a 42% margin. Manchin is a coward, he voted to save his #Senate seat.
Astonishing that in a speech lasting nearly one hour, #SusanCollins attacked #Democrats, discredited #ChristineBlaseyFord, extravagantly praised #BrettKavanaugh but never once referred to his tantrum before the Senate or the fact he lied under oath. Depressingly partisan outcome.
Dem Sen #JoeManchin  says he'll vote for #BrettKavanaugh. Had indicated that he wouldn't be the vote that pushed Kavanaugh over the line, but now that #SusanCollins has become the 50th vote, he's putting politics ahead of principle. Cowardly deference to #Trump ahead of midterms.

#BrettKavanagh will move to a final vote tomorrow after #SusanCollins, #JeffFlake, and Democrat #JoeManchin vote yes on procedural vote to move ahead. Republican #LisaMurkowski votes no. Kavanaugh still has enough votes to get move ahead - this balances on a knife edge.
@irishenergyblog @CiaranKilbride1 Not sure what your point is. #Trump has repeatedly belittled the FBI. That is a fact.

@AlZheimerHammer I understand your frustration Chris. But it’s not fair to blame the #FBI for this. This is a background check, not a criminal probe. The White House is the client. #Trump and #DonMcGahn dictate who is interviewed and who is excluded. Their hands are tied.

@irishenergyblog How? This is a job interview not a criminal investigation. #Kavanaugh’s friend #MarkJudge who was allegedly in the room when the assault took place could have testified before the Senate that it didn’t happen. Instead he went into hiding. What does that tell you?
@irishenergyblog @ABC She tried to keep it confidential. She tried to get the information privately to the Senate when he was on the shortlist precisely so the information could be assessed privately. She did her best to keep it confidential but her letter was leaked.
@alanzfsmith Once again,she told her therapist &amp; her husband about it back in 2012. She passed a polygraph. The sole witness - #BrettKavanaugh’s friend #MarkJudge who was in the room - refused to clear Kavanaugh before the Senate. And Kavanaugh lied repeatedly. Under oath.

@swans_song @SenatorDurbin Agree that a delay would serve the Democrats better than the Republicans, Mark. And Roe v Wade may be a factor in #Democrats resistance to #Kavanaugh. But #NeilGorsuch was not subjected to this - passed easily. This is about a credible claim of sexual assault and GOP response.
@alanzfsmith To be clear the threats were made on #ChristineBlaseyFord's life, not #BrettKavanuagh's. And the issue of temperament is critical when it comes to a lifetime appointment on the #SupremeCourt. He clearly lacks the dignity, objectivity and gravitas that are required for the job.
@alanzfsmith @SenatorDurbin How do you know he was falsely accused? It's revealing that you seem so willing to take him at his word and are so entirely indifferent to the trauma of #ChristineBlaseyFord, who credibly claims she was sexually assaulted by him as a teenager.
@chriser555 @alanzfsmith @SenatorDurbin Not at all Chris. What it shows is that he has not been truthful about his past - it goes to the issue of credibility. And #Ford never claimed he was a rapist. She said he sexually assaulted her while he was extremely drunk.

@alanzfsmith Not at all Alan. An FBI inquiry could be completed in a matter of days.  Previous checks didn't examine this. #FBI investigated #AnitaHill claims in 3 days &amp; concluded her allegations were unfounded. Whether you agree with that finding or not it was based on objective assessment.

@alanzfsmith @SenatorDurbin But I feel deeply sorry for his wife and daughters. And if this claim is false, #BrettKavanaugh has been subjected to a nightmare. But he hasn’t helped himself by evading questions and an objective investigative process.
@alanzfsmith @SenatorDurbin There is substantial corroborative evidence that he assaulted #ChristinaBlaseyFord. There are other claims by other women and men who knew him that he was a belligerent and excessive drinker which he had denied. His own yearbook entry shows his attitude to girls at the time.
@john_mcguirk #BrettKavanaugh was not denounced as a gang rapist. That is false. A woman claimed he and his friend were present at parties where sexual assaults occurred. That claim is not part of these proceedings. I’m not sure how by any objective standard you could describe him as calm.
@dolphinmaria I’ve no way of knowing if she’s speaking the truth Maria but she came across as extremely credible. I’d expect #BrettKavanuagh to be angry if these allegations are false but his response so far has been deeply unsettling. He does not appear to have the temperament for a judge.
@john_mcguirk Hi John I’d be very interested in hearing your view of the proceedings so far. In particular how you would rate #BrettKavanagh response to questions so far.
#BrettKavanuagh descends into ugly farce. After self-pitying, angry tirade he refuses to respond to @SenatorDurbin's question re #FBI. Comes across as wholly unsuitable to sit on any judicial bench much less #SupremeCourt. Unhinged rant from #LindseyGraham adds to circus. https://t.co/b62wtWm0Fy
#BrettKavanuagh testimony veers into the bizarre. Recounts his trips from "Texas to Pakistan to Buckingham Palace" with #GeorgeWBush. Unclear how this rebuts 1982 allegation of sexual assault. Tells Committee; "You'll never get me to quit. Never." https://t.co/mxcfDaWReu
With every partisan, angry, self-pitying word #BrettKavanaugh utters in his own defence, it becomes more and more apparent why he is wholly unqualified to sit on the #SupremeCourt. https://t.co/PTIWW3wYVf
#BrettKavanaugh's opening statement is angry, defensive, adopts the stance of victim. Slams nomination process as 'a national disgrace.' You have replaced 'advise and consent' with 'search and destroy' - accepts no responsibility for ducking FBI investigation. A dismal start.
A furious #LindseyGraham rants outside the #SenateJudiciaryCommittee  says he was amushed by #Democrats, seeks to undermine #ChristinaBlaseyFord by questioning who paid for polygraph. Defends decision not to call #MarkJudge and refuse #FBI inquiry.
#ChristinaBlaseyFord leaves #SenateJudiciaryCommittee hearing clearly rattled but having presented powerful and credible testimony. #GOP gun for hire  #RachelMitchell appears to have agreed with #Democratic criticism of GOP refusal to allow fact finding #FBI inquiry. https://t.co/VCr7VBB5Ve
@DonaldJTrumpJr is certainly no professor. Of any discipline. Except perhaps cringe-inducing tweets. 		That this is the only thing he can attack #ChristineBlaseyFord on underscores, rather than undermines, her credibility and #GOP panic.	 	#BrettKavanuagh #ChristineBlaseyFord https://t.co/QoZFJLnb1w
@AlZheimerHammer This entire debacle has certainly done them no favours, Chris.
@pwwillia Maybe Patrick! But from a #GOP perspective it would be the most politically pragmatic decision. Would give them a chance to partially salvage what has become a lose-lose situation. #BrettKavanaugh #ChristineBlasleyFord
#GOP could salvage situation with immediate withdrawal of #BrettKavanaugh &amp; nomination of alternative candidate. #AmyConeyBarrett would be a safe bet for #GOP; very conservative female judge who would appeal to evangelicals and salvage situation before the mid terms.
@garrethmcdaid I'm inclined to agree with you Gareth but I think this is worse than they had feared. She is entirely credible. It's very hard to see how they can discredit or ignore her testimony and push #BrettKavanaugh through regardless without paying a catastrophic price at the mid-terms.
After hearing #ChristineBlaseyFord's testimony, withdrawing #BrettKavanaugh's nomination still seems like the best of a set of lousy options for #GOP. Will #Trump do it? Or will #GOP insist on forcing through a damaged candidate and scuttle the integrity of the #SupremeCourt? https://t.co/kB0g9Y4jNy
Case for issuing subpoena to compel #MarkJudge,  other person in the room at time of alleged assault on #ChristineBlaseyFord  grows even stronger.  Ford claims she met him weeks later and he was clearly uncomfortable. Suggests he remembered alleged assault.
#ChristinaBlaseyFord tells Committee thing she remembers most vividly is the laughter of #BrettKavanaugh and #MarkJudge as she was pinned under Kavanaugh during the alleged assault.
#ChristineBlaseyFord finishes her opening speech. Appears as a credible witness under enormous strain.
@maolfhiosa Several women claimed to have either witnessed or been victims of assaults by #Kavanaugh. His Yale room mate &amp; others have described him as a belligerent, aggressive drunk. His own words contradict his claims of a blame free adolescence. Assume you have mother, sister, daughters?

@nfltexanchick @nytimes Always. When something is leaked, there is always an agenda.
One question always worth asking with regard to leaks:  Who benefits from publication of @NYTimes report? Right now, chief beneficiaries seem to be #Trump, who can use it as an excuse to fire #Rosenstein &amp; #FreedomCaucus which has demanded declassification of #AndyMcCabe's memos.
@GerCoyne @nytimes #MuellerInvestigation would be impossible to stop but new boss could curtail it. @NYTimes story impact may be blunted by others present who say #Rosenstein was obviously not serious. But it places him under microscope for  anonymous @NYTimes column.
@GerCoyne @nytimes Absolutely right Ger.  Already hearing here that #Rosenstein was using gallows humour during chaotic days after #JamesComey firing - he was furious at #Trump. But it provides #Trump with sufficient justification to fire #Rosenstein without sparking constitutional crisis.
#RodRosenstein didn't secretly record #Trump but #NYTimes report fuels claims of 'deep state' conspiracy against Trump. #Rosenstein says NY Times report is factually inaccurate but less than equivocal. Corroberates anonymous @NYtimes editorial - was it written by Rosenstein?
Will #RodRosenstein be fired? Deputy Attorney General denies explosive claim in @nytimes that he secretly recorded #Trump and wanted discussed invoking #25thAmendment.  If true, he's finished as head of #Russianinvestigation. https://t.co/3a8XE5fkL5
@swans_song Agree Mark! Right now, evidence is circumstantial at best. Which is why an objective FBI investigation, rather than one slanted by political partisanship by GOP or Dems, is needed. It might not support #ChristineBlaseyFord's version of events but it would be fair to both parties.

So @EdWhelanEPPC decides without a shred of evidence to announce that because #BrettKavanaugh couldn't possibly have done this, #ChristineBlaseyFord must have confused him with another classmate who he identifies as the alleged assailant.

@swans_song @irl_tax_expert Agree Mark - always look forward to our exchanges!
#ChristineBlaseyFord's lawyer indicates Ford willing to testify before #SenateJudiciaryCommittee but later next week. Time for #GOP members to stop treating her like a nuisance and with the respect any witness deserves.  Stop the bullying &amp; ultimatums.#BrettKavanaugh.
@GerCoyne Beats me, Ger. Seems a Republican operative, which is what #BrettKavanaugh is, who dissembled and misled his way through the nomination process so far, boasts about his heavy drinking as a teen and doesn't want an #FBI investigation, is more credible than any woman in GOP's view.
I disagree Mark. On both fronts. I think she will testify, and I'm bewildered, in the face of what has already emerged in the public arena, that you could say she has no credibility.  #BrettKavanuagh She is entirely credible. https://t.co/xbGysY0h2G
@swans_song Hi Mark, if the witness you refer to is #MarkJudge, he's refused to appear before the Committee. Why? Aside from fact that he would make a terrible witness because of views on sexual assault and his recollections about him and 'Barf O'Kavanaugh' drinking themselves to oblivion.

@JaneMahony Synopsis so far:	1. #Kavanaugh wasn't there.	2.If he was, he never behaved like this.	3.If he did, it was horseplay.	4.#MarkJudge who allegedly 'stood watch' denies #Ford's claim but refuses to testify for him.	5. Ford wants FBI probe. Kavanaugh doesn't.	6.#Trump lies, as usual.
Interesting 'horseplay' is also the Pennsylvania Catholic Church's word of choice to describe horrific sexual assaults on children. 		Personally, I've never seen a horse get drunk at a party and sexually assault a minor. And I've been to a lot of parties...  #BrettKavanaugh https://t.co/4Vada6pdEJ
@swans_song FBI can interview witnesses ie #MarkJudge (which is what the #GOP is afraid of). So why not? You have no evidence she's not a 'real' attempted rape victim. A victim of abuse by a Pennsylvania priest stayed silent for 70 years. Did he make it harder for victims to be believed?
@swans_song Ok, fair point. But Feinstein had duty to protect Ford's identify. GOP is back to the 1950's with this - order an alleged victim of sexual assault to turn up at specific time or else. Why can't the FBI look into it? They do this kind of thing all the time with background checks.
@swans_song Really? Read his decisions on Native Americans, his attempt to deny a pregnant migrant teen in detention an abortion, and his dissembling during hearings. Also, his unhinged memos as Ken Starr's counsel on Lewinksy. FBI CAN investigate. No evidence her allegations are unfounded.
@PajoMcGuigan Completely agree. If #Kavanaugh’s denials are genuine and he never assaulted Professor Ford then he shouldn’t be unfairly penalized. But let’s have a proper investigation first. There is no rush. #GOP was fine with leaving Supreme Court seat empty for a full year in 2016.
@alex_meehan But could be worse if he stays, Alex, given that he's already painted himself into a corner with an unequivocal denial. This is #AnitaHill v 2.0 but through #MeToo prism. He's already been criticised for misleading Senate. If Ford proves credible, #GOP has a real problem.
Will #BrettKavanaugh withdraw from consideration for #SupremeCourt? May be least bad of lousy options now facing #Trump ahead of mid-terms.#MarkJudge, Kavanaugh pal &amp; 3rd person allegedly in room during incident would be a terrible witness, given his memoir &amp; opinions about rape.

@CalThomas @SenFeinstein Let's wait and see. It may be something about nothing but if an allegation of sexual assault has been made against a candidate for the Supreme Court, it should be investigated, just as it should in any other case. #BrettKavanaugh

@tjwhite3535 @JohnJHarwood @itsmommy Couldn't agree more Timothy. They're wholly ineffectual at communicating their message, regardless of whether or not they in control of White House and/or Congress. And even worse in opposition! Imagine what the #GOP would do if the Dems handed them a similar hand to play.
@reddave1985 Good point David. I don't think #Trump's base cares if Trump or his campaign conspired with Russian agents to get 'dirt' on #Clinton. But I think about 65 % of the electorate will care if Mueller concludes there are grounds to indict him for obstruction of justice/conspiracy

@TheDuck90 Impeachment is a very long shot even if Dems take control of House &amp; Senate in November and that’s far from certain. Supreme Court will likely become involved at some point. Base desert him? No chance!
IF this is true, it's explosive. It goes not just to conspiracy/collusion with #RussianHacking meddling; it also provides  grounds to bring obstruction of justice charges against #Trump.

@Huckleb10408653 Sorry - this is based on misinformation. The moderates may be guilty of unjustifiable acts of violence but there is no moral equivalence. They splintered due to lack of outside support; then some members defected to ISIS. But it started as moderates rebels battle for democracy.

@Huckleb10408653 Huge difference in #Syria between rebel fighters and ISIS/terrorist groups. Moderates were led by Syrian army chiefs who defected because they refused to obey #Assad orders to kill unarmed citizens. Best hope for Syrian democracy withered because of #US and #EU moral cowardice.

Washington staggered by #Trump's invitation to #Putin to the visit the #WhiteHouse before the November 2018 elections. So this time, #Putin can oversee Russia's midterm election hacking from the White House....
What will it take? Today #Republican controlled Senate blocked bi-partisan resolution that would put the #Senate on record as supporting the #US intelligence agencies conclusion that #Russia hacked 2016 elections.  Inexplicable - given fallout from  #HelsinkiSummit . https://t.co/qdjJpTOENl
@DjangoNolehardt Noted #Putin’s ‘strong and powerful denial. Followed by his observation that he couldn’t think of any reason Russia would do it. - changed to ‘wouldn’t today’ - very clear he was hanging his own intel agencies out to dry. Last words were ‘total witch hunt.’
@AlZheimerHammer Afraid so. There has been pressure for this from big donors for some time.
#Trump says he made a mistake - said the word 'would' instead of 'wouldn't. -  as in "I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be Russia." instead of "I don't see any reason why it would be Russia."	 	Literally incredible.  Another gift to the late night comics.  #TrumpPutinSummit

@JosephCaulfield Hi Joseph this isn’t true. The 2% is an agreement stipulating it should be reached by 2024 - six years from now. Most of the countries are well on the way to acheieving this. The US’s NATO allies have provided $50 billion support to US in Afghanistan and $2.5 bn a year in East.
So the former head of the #CIA asks the US allies to defend #NATO against the US President...#Trump’s tirades today underscore total  lack of knowledge of how NATO works. It would be tragicomic - if it wasn’t so lethally dangerous. https://t.co/dq0YltAAZs

Suffering this has caused is incalculable. A visit to the 8th floor of McAllen federal court might enlighten White House.
@EamonReilly_com @cooper_m @CalThomas @TodayFM Probably a waste of time clarifying this, but law allows for separation of children if parents are charged with offence and placed in custody. Under Obama, only parents charged with serious felony offences - ie murder, robbery - were separated. NEVER separated for illegal entry.
"Children belong in communities, not cages." #McAllen holds vigil to protest  #Trump zero tolerance policy of prosecuting all asylum seekers &amp; illegal immigrants, despite downpour. Kids no longer forcibly separated but zero tolerance remains. Guarantees utter chaos and disaster. https://t.co/Hwzhgt1NZM
@AlZheimerHammer @Jim_Sheridan @MaiaDunphy Afraid so Chris. The children are now in a separate legal process. Many are too young to provide any info about themselves.

@SeeMack_ie No. This is a huge problem. Some of these children are too young to talk or identify themselves. Lawyers have told me that detained mothers have been told they will be deported without their children. There is no process in place at the moment for reunification. #BorderCrisis
White House signals that #Trump will announce he will end policy of separating children and babies from their parents following international condemnation and panic amongst #Republicans at growing public  backlash. Major reversal by #Trump. Meanwhile at border, chaos continues.

@delexical @realDonaldTrump Hicks' was an enabler. Porter was an administrator. Problem is no-one is in charge. Normally, #POTUS leads, while Chief of Staff ensures everything runs smoothly.

@AlZheimerHammer @Jim_Sheridan @cooper_m I don't think so, Chris. It's not posted on @realDonaldTrump's twitter account. If it's intended as a joke, it's pretty unfunny.
@torebel You shouldn't be! The way US citizens, teenagers, women, career civil servants and DoJ officials have joined forces to defend American ideals and institutions is inspiring - sums up all that is great about the #USA .
Oh dear...now where did we hear ‘Mission Accomplished!’ before? Oh yes - #GeorgeWBush - a few weeks into the US invasion of Iraq... 	mission won’t be accomplished until sanctions force Russia to stop funding #Assad genocide &amp; 12 million Syrians can return home. https://t.co/SMkFQoFDAy
@dkahanerules @MichaelCohen212 Realise that; apologies: should have been clearer; suggestion that he flew to Germany, entered Prague by crossing border into Poland entering Czech Republic via Czech / Poland border.
Sums it up. #DefenceSecretaryJamesMattis indicates 120 missiles - double the number Trump dispatched after #Assad chemical attack a year ago - hit three targets, including one chemical storage facility. https://t.co/byOhwvdaD1
@DreamBigLeague_ @MichaelCohen212 This is a long discredited claim.
@AlZheimerHammer Had to think about that one!
@Margaretfee Afraid it can Margaret! And even another 6.5 years too. One of the overlooked aspects of the #Trump presidency is the similarity to the #Bush/Cheney era: maligning of rivals and critics, constant lies, croneyism and scandal - didn't stop Bush being reelected. #Dems way too smug.
#McClatchy News reports that #MuellerInvestigation has uncovered evidence that #Trump lawyer #MichaelCohen was in Prague in 2016. One of the most vehemently denied aspects of the #SteeleDossier was that Cohen entered Poland through Germany to meet a Russian fixer. https://t.co/2xoRaf3wJi

#PaulRyan's resignation inevitable. His reputation has taken a hammering in the past year for his spineless acquiescence to #Trump's worst excesses. He was also facing a humiliating defeat and presiding over the decimation of GOP in #2018Midterms. https://t.co/vbQSwktwNo
#Zuckerbergtestimony shows futility of this type of #Senate forum. Instead of 43 #Senators, most of whom use their 5 minutes to preen before cameras, why don't #GOP &amp; #Dems each appoint half a dozen Senators with expertise who can ask useful questions &amp; follow up on answers. https://t.co/19oCDlcPGH
#Trump has power to fire #Mueller, says @PressSecSanders. Not true. He can order #Rosenstein to do so; federal regulations spell this out. If Deputy AG refuses, Trump can fire him &amp; install patsy to carry out his orders. But easier to fire #Sessions &amp; replace with new flunkey. https://t.co/3NfwXskcZ8
@AlZheimerHammer It's a satirical piece by #AndyBowowitz. It's a sign of the times that Borowitz was celebrated for his extreme satire - now it's hard to tell the difference between satire and fact!
#MarkZuckerberg tells Senate hearing that he has not been interviewed by #MuellerProbe but indicates other #Facebook execs have.
@AlZheimerHammer @jeffsessions @MichaelCohen212 To fire #Mueller #Trump has to get rid of #Rosenstein; then you're in #Nixon territory. Dems will fume but difference now is that #GOP leadership is spineless so unlikely to take action. But firing #Mueller now won't work - probe is too far advanced now.

@tomiahonen Absolutely agree Tomi. Can't have been easy but NY Southern District office has well deserved reputation for independence. #Berman must have had compelling reason to approve it. For a judge to sign off on a raid on US President's lawyer....
Also worth pointing out that #GeoffBerman, new US Attorney for NY ok'd the FBI raid on #MichaelCohen on foot of a judicially approved warrant. Berman, a #Trump donor was interviewed personally by Trump before his appointment on Jan 3. Tirade against #Mueller et al is nonsense. https://t.co/7EAZGivlC8
#Trump rails against #Mueller #RodRosenstein &amp; #JeffSessions with completely false claims about collusion findings. Most likely head to roll is #Sessions: then Trump can appoint a new #AttGen who could oversee #MuellerInvestigation &amp; hobble it with funding cuts / restrictions. https://t.co/HOULEjh5RB
#StormyDaniels lawyer indicates on #CNN that #MichaelCohen may have misled #FirstRepublicBank about intended purpose of $130,000 loan. Understandable really - unlikely bank manager would believe it was to be used to pay off a porn star who had an affair with the President!
Important to remember that if any criminal charges are filed against #MichaelCohen as a result of evidence seized in this #FBI raid they will likely be filed by the NY Att Gen under state,not federal, laws. So if #Cohen is convicted #Trump cannot pardon him.

#HRC surrogate-in-chief #Obama making case for her presidency in #SwingState  #Dems need #Senate or #GOP plans to hobble #HRC will succeed. https://t.co/8emg4vBxlY
@angiebeeb @dkahanerules I agree. That's why his actions since July are bewildering. He was a straight shooter. But got too fond of the mic!
Comey furore, only 7 days to go...or just the start of a new battle? Tune in to @lstwrd @cooper_m to get the latest from @CalThomas &amp; myself https://t.co/z6LmbbLBEi
@angiebeeb @dkahanerules Not about #FBI #Comey's position untenable. Even some #GOP say he's done. #HRC deleted emails; but no crime alleged
@orwell4ever @angiebeeb Hi Mark Just to clarify: the law only criminalizes violations that are 'knowing' or 'negligent'. Agree its confusing
@dkahanerules Sadly Michael I would say that by any objective reading #JamesComey was not doing his job. He has mishandled this from outset.
@philip_malley at this stage Philip it's really hard to tell; momentum appears to be going against #HRC but #Dems base now energised &amp; angry
Last week #HRC was campaigning in red states. #2016election unprecedented; sadly volatility is likely to continue past November 8. https://t.co/MHwtPTZ2Im
Hard to overstate fury and frustration here over #jamescomey. #HRC &amp; #Trump gearing up for contested election. This could get even uglier. https://t.co/XuMEGM0dr2
@ray_egan Seriously Ray...many a true word spoken in jest! Right now it doesn't sound like such a bad idea!
@angiebeeb @orwell4ever sadly Angie in this election you have to look at who is saying it rather than what is being said. Gowdy is example!
@orwell4ever I agree Mark: this could be nothing, could be linked to double jobbing with State and #Teneo or something else. We don't know.
@swans_song @NYDailyNews I have sympathy for #GOP voters who cant vote #Trump.He doesn't represent #GOP of #JohnKasich &amp; millions like him.
With the caveat (as if you need it) that literally anything could happen in the next 7 days... https://t.co/OYvbFdy7Cb

@orwell4ever If evidence that emails were deliberately hidden  on #Abedin laptop then yes, absolutely. But emails haven't been looked at yet
@orwell4ever Hi Mark just to clarify #HRC having private servier is breach of regulations. It is not a crime. Powell also had private server
Do these emails related to period when #HumaAbedin had 'special employee status' with Dept of State &amp; was simultaneously working for #Teneo? https://t.co/dJVKaSko1G
#Comey furore obscures interesting legal question about ownership of data.
@orwell4ever @angiebeeb Hi Angie. Just to clarify, FBI &amp; 8 congressional investigations found #HRC broke no laws &amp; no evidence of crime

#Trump '#HRC criminal action was wilful, deliberate..tried to hide criminal conduct'..'cover up her crimes'..jeers &amp; chants 'Lock her up'
#Trump live in Phoenix. Armed with new ammunition on ObamaCare, Wikileaks and #Comey he still can't resist tirade against 'disgusting'media. https://t.co/HdhrGgaHS7
@swans_song Once again we agree!
New @washingtonpost /ABC poll says #HRC &amp; #Trump now neck &amp;neck. #HRC national 12 point lead wiped out. Most turbulent election in memory.
Will #COMEY actions galvanise #HRC supporters? Fury mounting. Grievance is a great motivator for voters lacking enthusiasm. Ask #Trump! https://t.co/tPcKL1ACDP
@swans_song think it's shot either way Mark. No problem with transparency but this was bizarre &amp; ill-judged - no facts just innuendo.

#Clinton comes out swinging. Says Americans deserve to know the full facts behind #FBI reopening of email investigation 'without delay'.
@swans_song let's see what investigation yields Mark. It could be anything from an innocent oversight to something that could scupper #HRC

@Colin0Brien1 speculation frenzy here at the moment Colin. Several contacts say #HRC may not be directly implicated. But v bad news for #HRC
Does #FBi investigation stem from period when #HumaAbedin was on leave from #State Dept and working as consultant for #Teneo?
Well, he would say that.... https://t.co/Uk8kiXcuTc
Information emerging that new emails in question were not written by #HilaryClinton.	Is focus now on her closest aide #HumaAbedin?
#Trump has just arrive onstage in Maine. Deafening cheers as he announces FBI reopening investigation. Now he has 'great respect' for FBI.
Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton calls for Special Counsel to take over #FBI email investigation. Is #KenStarr available?? #GOP ecstatic.
#HumaAbedin had account on #Clinton private email server. Why has #FBI only seized her device now? Was it concealed - or big blunder by FBI?
#FBI reopened emails investigation after seizing electronic device belonging to top #HRC aide #HumaAbedin in separate probe into her husband https://t.co/lHnfgCa6yI

Gleeful RNC boss #ReincePriebus on Fox News 'why would FBI do this if this is not extraordinarily serious?' #Trump euphoric at NH rally.

So far unclear whether any classified information was found on #Weiner devices.  #HRC campaign 'seething' at #FBI handling of announcement.
@movr46 agree Mo! There has never been an election like it. Extraordinary twist - FBI probe into underage sexting by #HRC aide's ex-husband!
@Colin0Brien1 Hi Colin - think this will dominate the next few days. FBI is being vague - emails came from separate probe into #Weiner
