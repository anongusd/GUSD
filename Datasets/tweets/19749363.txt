@DarylNorthrop concentration should be on forcing Washington to change it's ways, not forcing American people to pay more $ for more govt
@DarylNorthrop how does raising taxes on anyone help create jobs? What is purpose aside from class warfare & giving dc more $ to spend?
@DarylNorthrop increased revenue shld b result of growing economy, larger taxbase not class warfare and socking it to "rich"
@DarylNorthrop and why is ur solution always forcing citizens to pay more of their own $ to finance dc irresponsibility and bloated govt?
@DarylNorthrop anyone that successfully led congress to 4 balanced budgets is by default serious, no?
@DarylNorthrop obama depression wld make it harder 2 balance budget but w/leadership it can b done. requires cuts, more jobs, govt reform

@DarylNorthrop ur theory implies the budget just balanced itself. U 4get that newt-led house pledged to balance in 7 yrs, did it in 3
