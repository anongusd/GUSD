For my English speaking folks: 	Venezuela facing another socio-economic implosion.		Yesterday President Maduro announced a devaluation of 3000% just days before a readjustment to national banknotes.
A todo esto, s√∫mele un cambio de cono monetario para el que nadie estaba preparado: hay que quitarle 5 ceros a todos los montos que conoc√≠an.		¬øUsted no entendi√≥? Los venezolanos tampoco.		#Venezuela
El anuncio m√°s importante qued√≥ entre l√≠neas pero no pas√≥ desapercibido: 	Salario de 1.800 BsS= 0,5 Petros = 32$ = Bs 5.500.000 		El precio oficial del d√≥lar pas√≥ de 200.000 a 5.500.000	El viernes negro se qued√≥ p√°lido.		#Venezuela
Salario m√≠nimo en Venezuela sufri√≥ aumento de 3000%.	Empresarios no podr√°n asumirlo: precios aumentar√°n y aun as√≠ miles perder√°n su trabajo. 	El gobierno asumir√° ajuste salarial al sector privado por 3 meses: ¬øantes o despu√©s de pagar lo que deben en el sector salud y educaci√≥n?
#Venezuela en incertidumbre. El presidente Maduro anunci√≥ ayer, entre otras cosas:		Aumento de salario de 5 a 180 millones de bol√≠vares.		Venta de la gasolina a "precios internacionales" para quienes no participen de los censos del gobierno.		Aumento de impuestos IVA e ISLR.

In social media and in traditional journalism its crucial to be fair and balanced. If your reporting reflects the truth, nobody can deny it
Compare versions and points of view: check different sources to confirm info, seek unbiased accounts, recognize opinions from reports
Have a 'go to' list of networks, journalists and verified accounts to previously know journalists and outlets that are reliable
Check source of videos/images to know if the multimedia content is new or if it has been shared in the past
üáªüá™ On days like today, it's essential to verify the sources of the info we receive and share. Here are some tips to consider: #30Jul
En redes sociales y en periodismo tradicional es fundamental ser responsables. Si nuestro trabajo refleja la verdad, nadie lo podr√° negar
Acudir a medios, periodistas verificados y canales de difusi√≥n confiables. Evitar replicar info de cuentas an√≥nimas y rumores sin confirmar
Comparar versiones y puntos de vista: acudir a diferentes fuentes para confirmar, buscar imparcialidad, diferenciar opiniones de reportajes
Revisar procedencia de videos e im√°genes para a saber si el contenido multimedia es actual o ha sido compartido en el pasado #Venezuela
üáªüá™En d√≠as hist√≥ricos como hoy, es necesario verificar las fuentes de la info que recibimos y compartimos. Aqu√≠ mis 3 tips para hacerlo:
#Venezuela Electoral Council announced that no media or journalist -even with credentials- can be within 500 meters of polling stations
Tension in #Venezuela while Maduro's Constituent Assembly process begins. Opposition calls for protests across the country #30Jul

Con la salida de Estados Unidos la eficacia de la #ParisClimateDeal disminuye: Estados Unidos es el segundo mayor contaminante del mundo
Grandes empresas como Apple, Microsoft y Exxon sugirieron a Trump quedarse en el #ParisClimateDeal, generaba m√°s empleos de energ√≠a limpia
Trump cumpli√≥ promesa de campa√±a, sacando a EE.UU. del #ParisClimateDeal, porque eliminaba trabajos en industrias del carb√≥n y petr√≥leo
#BREAKINGNEWS Trump announced US withdrawal from the #ParisClimateDeal but will "begin negotiations" to re-enter or make new deal
US withdrawal from #ParisClimateDeal would raise global temp by 0.2-0.5F by the end of the century
With the USA's exit the efficacy of the #ParisClimateDeal decreases: US is the world's second-largest polluter
Major businesses such as Apple, Microsoft and Exxon wanted Trump to stick to the #ParisClimateDeal because it generated jobs in clean energy

While we wait for Trump's final verdict on #ParisAgreement, remember: a future president could rejoin the agreement at the flick of a pen
Failing to mitigate climate change now will lead to spending millions $$ dealing with the damage, itwill endanger future generations
If the US -2nd-biggest CO2 emitter- withdraws from #ParisAgreement other countries might follow, leading to 	more emissions
If the US were to pull out of the #ParisAgreement, it would join Nicaragua &amp; Syria as 3 out of the 145 countries that have signed on

I bet confidence among minority women (latino, asian, black) is much more concerning. What do you think?
Numbers represent a sharp drop since 2015, when about half of both women, 43%, and men, 47%, said they were confident about the US's future
Only 29% of all American women say they have a lot of confidence in the direction of the country, while 53% of men share that sentiment
A Pew Research Center study on public trust in the govt. has found that women are now far less confident about the US's future than men are

It shows changes in the Australian parliament: 8years ago, a senator had her 2yo daughter taken from her arms, removed from the senate floor
While the Australian senate rules allowed breastfeeding in the chamber, now parents can take care of infants while on parliament floor.
Australian senator, @LarissaWaters, made history after she became the 1st politician to breastfeed a baby in the parliament senate chamber.

This law is the 1st to be signed after president Trump's executive order to withhold funding from cities that don't comply with ICE requests
Director of the ACLU of Texas, said they planned to challenge the law "in the courts, at the ballot box and in the streets if we have to."
The law is very controversial. Some call it the "show me your papers measure" that will be used to discriminate, specially against Latinos.
The bill in #Texas also threatens sheriffs with jail if they don't cooperate with federal immigration agents.
Police officers can check the immigration status of anyone they detain, help immigration agents crack down on suspects in the US illegally
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill that bans "sanctuary cities" in his state. The law takes effect on Sep. 1
