In states that haven‚Äôt expanded Medicaid, premiums and health care costs are higher and rural hospital closures are far more common.

This is shameful. For every worker who has to dip into savings, darken the doors of a payday lender, or apply for unemployment, this is a dark day in this country and political games in Washington are to blame. #TrumpShutdown END
No wall, no matter how high or wide, will help that American worker get their finances back on track or help them run from the cycle of debt they've been trapped in. Thanks #TrumpShutdown!
The payday loan industry is having a field day with the #TrumpShutdown, taking advantage of people desperate for an infusion of cash to pay bills. We all know how that ends-endless cycles of debt for some, repossessed cars, financial ruin for others. https://t.co/7GAAw80URx
A wall will not pay them for the hours the #TrumpShutdown has taken from them or feed their families or buy their medicine in the meantime.
On top of missed paychecks for federal workers, there are also 1000s of hourly workers who work in the cafeterias or on the custodial staff at these agencies who will not get backpay. The #TrumpShutdown is leaving them even less economically secure.
What many in Washington don‚Äôt understand is that the average American can‚Äôt miss a paycheck without dipping in to savings. And for far too many, there are no savings to dip into or parent to ask for money from.
THREAD: From men and women of the Coast Guard working in Mobile, to National Park Service rangers in Selma to NASA workers and contractors in Huntsville, thousands of Alabama workers will go without paychecks today because of the #TrumpShutdown!

The holiday season is a reminder of the importance of family, and the commutation of Mayor Langford‚Äôs sentence means that our former Mayor can spend his final days at home in Alabama with loved ones. My prayers are with the whole Langford family as they reunite.
I want to thank the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama Jay Town, Senator Doug Jones, our federal partners, and all those who worked side-by-side with our office despite the government shutdown to secure Mayor Langford‚Äôs release.
As I have said before, justice should be fair, but merciful. I am deeply grateful to all those who heeded our renewed call for the immediate compassionate release of Mayor Larry Langford.
I am calling on the Trump Administration to act with compassion in the case of Mayor Langford and immediately reduce his sentence. Justice should be fair but also merciful. Mayor Langford should spend his final days surrounded by family in Alabama. https://t.co/UVbHZIRJ1N

This is a one-two punch for American taxpayers. First, we have to pay for the expense of a government shutdown, on top of that we‚Äôre being asked to pay for the expense of Trump‚Äôs pet project. Time for Republicans to come to their senses and work with Dems to reopen the government
It is unconscionable that Trump would shut down the federal government to secure $5 billion for a wall that the American public does not want. This Republican Congress could not find funding for teacher pay, for access to health care, or for infrastructure investments!
Unbelievable! 12:04am Government is SHUTDOWN! Irresponsible and Unacceptable! Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House and they simply can NOT Govern!!! All over a wall!!  Shame on you for the Trump Shutdown!!
Big win!! Today, in a bipartisan vote, the House passed legislation which paves the way for the release of records pertaining to civil rights era cold cases. Thanks @SenDougJones for leading the way on this! We should NEVER give up on justice.
Trump‚Äôs new food assistance requirements destroy another ladder out of poverty. We cannot become a nation that allows families to go hungry, or denies a hand up to those in need. As a country, we are better than that.

Last week's ACA ruling by an extreme right-wing judge would throw tens of millions of Americans off their health care. We cannot allow Republicans to eliminate health care protections and access for American families, including people with pre-existing conditions.
Ryan Zinke's tenure as Interior Secretary was marked by the extravagant, wasteful use of taxpayer dollars. Our taxpayers deserve better. In the new Congress, Dems are making ethics reforms a top priority as part of our work to build a government of, by, and for the people!

Without immigrant doctors &amp; nurses, our doctor shortages in rural areas would be even worse. As many rural Alabamians are painfully aware, the amount of doctors in our communities isn‚Äôt just a measure of privilege, it‚Äôs a matter of life and death.	https://t.co/dta4tSNDqU

My heartfelt prayers are with E.J.‚Äôs family and all those injured and impacted by this tragic event. As a community, we must insist that ALEA, the Hoover Police Department and all law enforcement involved, conduct this investigation with the utmost transparency to the public.
I join with the community in calling for justice for E.J. and the other victims. The senseless tragedy that led to the death of Emantic ‚ÄúE.J.‚Äù Bradford, Jr. must be thoroughly investigated and all the facts brought into the light.

No family should have to live with a contaminated backyard, and no community should be left to clean up decades of industrial waste. We must continue fighting for a full cleanup of North Birmingham until our whole community is made safe.
The charges brought against Trey Glenn provide additional evidence that the EPA‚Äôs initial review of the North Birmingham site was undermined by a misinformation campaign, and that North Birmingham should be reconsidered for the National Priority List.
This week‚Äôs indictment in the EPA Superfund site case was a step forward for residents of North Birmingham who were the victim of corruption and hazardous pollution. But we still have work to do seeking justice for families whose homes and communities have been contaminated!!

The realities of severe poverty in America are undeniable. In parts of America, families struggle to put food on the table or afford basic necessities like a working wastewater system. Before dismissing poverty, Ambassador Haley should see for herself: https://t.co/ayxMMZvNf3
One in five US children live in poverty - Trump's tax cuts for the wealthy don't give them a pathway out. It's time for this Administration to come up with a plan to help the marginalized and forgotten communities struggling under the weight of generational poverty.
UN Ambassador Haley thinks it's "patently ridiculous" to study poverty in America - what's truly ridiculous is disregarding poverty and doing nothing. If @nikkihaley doesn't believe that extreme poverty exists in the US, I'm inviting her to confirm the UN's findings in Alabama.
This President continues to disgracefully side with a hostile dictator over the men and women of our own intelligence community. National security should not be a partisan issue. When will the Republicans that control Congress stand up to Trump?

85 rural hospitals have closed since 2010. We could reopen every one of them with the $92 billion Republicans are trying to throw at HSAs for the wealthy.
Or if we wanted to help our rural hospitals finance the costs of their medical staff, we could hire 657,000 nurses AND 221,000 physicians, just with the money Republicans voted to waste this week on benefits for the wealthy
With $92 billion, we could get high quality inpatient rehab treatment for 3.6 million Americans struggling with addiction and opioid abuse.
With that kind of money, we could increase NIH's budget by 250%!! That would mean better investments in cures and treatments for diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's, and heart disease

In fact, the $92 billion pricetag on today‚Äôs unpaid-for Republican bills is enough to provide every registered hospital in America with over $16 million to expand services, train doctors, and update equipment @WaysMeansCmte

Putin could not have won a more compliant president. The whole reason we set up #NATO was to protect our front line allies from Russian encroachment. This is not the time to let down our guard, or let down our allies.
Unfortunately, an initial review of Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs record shows that he will likely drive #SCOTUS farther to the right, threatening further attacks on access to health care, our right to vote, affirmative action, and all the important progress that we have made as a nation.
Our high court plays a critical role in upholding justice and equality. It was #SCOTUS that ordered an end to Jim Crow segregation and put a stop to the use of poll taxes. It is so important Kennedy‚Äôs replacement bring a strong sense of equality, fairness, and justice to the job.

Mr. President, what you are committing against innocent children is nothing short of child abuse. Pick up the phone, call your cabinet and tell them to stop pursuing a policy of family separation. #KeepFamiliesTogether @realDonaldTrump
The fact is that Trump could stop separating children from their parents today if he wanted to. But since he won‚Äôt, I‚Äôm calling on Congress to pass the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act. We need a vote today. Not next week, not next month - today.
We cannot stand idly by while this inhumane treatment continues in our country‚Äôs name. Proud to join fellow Democrats taking a stand to #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/zxoRXOrwdt
Republicans are bringing the Farm Bill back for another vote - possibly tomorrow. With $23 billion in SNAP cuts, this bill is cruel and shortsighted. We should not be taking food off the table for our country's working families.
Let's bring the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act up for a vote today. Not tomorrow, not next week, let's end Trump's inhumane family separation policy now. https://t.co/B4Nj5FblUj
I can only imagine the pain of being separated from your family. As a little girl in Selma, my family meant everything to me. Trump‚Äôs inhumane treatment of innocent children needs to stop now #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/m64y6cuOmn
Today, #Juneteenth, marks the anniversary of the end of slavery in the U.S.  ‚Äì the day slaves in Galveston were finally freed two years after the Emancipation Proclamation. Today we celebrate how far we‚Äôve come since that moment, and acknowledge how far we have to go. https://t.co/D1yrKkOKNi
Today I'm cosponsoring the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act because we need to put a stop to the Trump Administration‚Äôs inhumane and unlawful separation policy. Tearing kids from their families when they are at their most vulnerable is a disgraceful abuse of human rights.
My bipartisan bill to address the opioid crisis is coming to the floor for a vote! The Preventing Addiction for Susceptible Seniors (PASS) Act helps prevent abuse among seniors without limiting access to needed medications. https://t.co/S1vGnxwMhD
There is bipartisan legislation in the House that could end the DREAMers crisis right now. The USA Act has 30 GOP cosponsors and 30 Dems - it would pass if it were brought to the floor today. Instead, GOP leaders prefer to keep our immigration system in a state of crisis.
We need to let voters choose their lawmakers, not the other way around #RestoreTheVote https://t.co/l9VgGX2Vhh
This #FathersDay is a chance for us to reflect on the importance of family - and why it's inhumane to tear families apart. Separating innocent kids from their parents goes against the values we cherish as a country. We're better than that. #FamiliesBelongTogether

Voting is not a use it or lose it right. It is a permanent right guaranteed by our Constitution. The Supreme Court‚Äôs misguided decision today opens the door for states to disenfranchise voters just because they didn‚Äôt cast their ballot. Shameful. https://t.co/FD12rULOPI

New strategies for disenfranchisement, from gerrymandering to voter ID laws, are keeping citizens from having a meaningful voice in elections and the results are alarming. From healthcare to tax cuts, special interests groups are monopolizing DC #ABetterDeal #RestoreTheVote
If we want to build a stronger democracy, we have to engage and empower ALL American voters #BetterDeal #RestoreTheVOTE

Here's what we did get when Republicans charged $2.2 trillion to our national credit card: corporate stock buybacks are up 43 percent, that means the rich are getting richer, and executives who are compensated in shares are seeing their wealthy skyrocket. #GOPTaxScam
The fact is that consumer spending has not accelerated. Wages for middle-class families are not up. GDP growth has not accelerated. Instead, the #GOPTaxScam left us with a $2.2 trillion deficit and cuts to health and safety net programs that working families rely on. https://t.co/fdOma0xpby
Today, Republicans on the @WaysMeansCmte are trying to defend the disastrous #GOPTaxScam with one-off anecdotes. But let's keep our eyes on the facts. The fact is that the majority of tax cuts went to wealthy Americans, leaving working families with the tab. https://t.co/eHNMKnGrNC

Attending the Opening Ceremony for the EJI National Museum and Memorial for Peace and Justice tonight. So excited to see @repjohnlewis https://t.co/VKW6u9oZLO
I‚Äôm so grateful to have had the opportunity to share this experience with my mom! This is a very important reminder of a painful past and I hope it helps bring some much needed healing. https://t.co/PtOtzc76zl
It‚Äôs overwhelming to see the sheer magnitude of lynchings across the state of Alabama and across the country. These where dark times in our nation‚Äôs history and it‚Äôs a incredible to see these victims being finally acknowledged. I‚Äôm hopeful this brings about some needed healing. https://t.co/ojxXEtxi6A
Today, I'll be in Montgomery for the unveiling of the first ever memorial to victims of lynching and racial terror in America. This Memorial finds its home in AL, where more than 300 African Americans were killed by lynching and millions more were terrorized by white supremacy.
As we reflect on the anniversary of #Flint, rural America is facing another water crisis: deteriorating wastewater infrastructure. We have to act before it's too late #DontForgetFlint https://t.co/6QPRwwpoI3
No matter how painful, these are memories which our nation must confront. Tomorrow, I'll be in attendance for the opening of our nation's first memorial to victims of lynching and racial terror. https://t.co/w9tNPFHUTh
As we recognize the anniversary of Flint, where state and federal support came years after the contamination of local drinking water, we have to take this opportunity to reflect on the need for immediate action to repair our water and wastewater infrastructure. https://t.co/vQyscn0CYQ
The health impacts of failing wastewater treatment are destructive and costly. In parts of rural Alabama where straight pipes are common, residents have tested positive for parasites that were thought to have been eradicated from the U.S. decades ago. https://t.co/nTl5sVOJvQ
There is no national study estimating the number of families in the United States without a connection to proper wastewater treatment, but based on the experiences of Alabama, Minnesota, and Kentucky, the issue could easily impact millions of Americans.
But rural Alabama is not the only area where wastewater infrastructure has created a health crisis. One 2004 study showed that an estimated 60,000 residents in Minnesota used a straight pipe to empty untreated sewage into the environment around their house.
I have seen this crisis firsthand in rural Alabama. In our state‚Äôs rural Black Belt, I have toured rural communities where a home‚Äôs only sewage system is a straight pipe that carries untreated waste 30 feet into the woods. https://t.co/mGZxfOpc36
As we recognize the fourth anniversary of Flint, another water crisis is brewing in our nation's backyard - in rural America, deteriorating infrastructure and lack of investment have left an untold number of families without access to wastewater treatment https://t.co/6QPRwwpoI3

Today I spoke on the House floor to honor a mentor, a fellow Selma-native, a voting rights activist, and an American hero, Reverend Dr. Frederick Douglas Reese. He will be missed, and his legacy will never be forgotten. https://t.co/kug67tUzNB
But here's where the #GOPTaxScam hits working families the hardest: healthcare. Under the new law, 13 million Americans will lose healthcare coverage, and tax breaks for the wealthy set the stage for Medicare and Medicaid cuts. Shameful. #TaxDay
While most hardworking Americans aren‚Äôt noticing an increase in their paychecks from the tax law, average Wall Street bonuses have jumped an average of 17 percent to $184,220!! That's the highest since the financial crisis a decade ago, many times higher than average pay. #TaxDay
This #TaxDay, let's talk about the real impact of the #GOPTaxScam: higher costs for working families and huge breaks for the top 1 percent. Instead of investing in billionaires, our tax system should put the American worker first!!

This scenario might have been unthinkable under any other president in modern history, but Trump has shown he will not hesitate to undermine democratic institutions. When it comes to defending our democracy, I'm hopeful that Members on both sides of the aisle can come together.
I'm calling on Congress to pass a bill protecting the Russia investigation from President Trump. In order to avert a constitutional crisis, Congress has to act to protect Mueller‚Äôs investigation.

It is our job to make sure that federal resources are directed to accountable centers that care for our children‚Äôs health and safety, especially as safe child care centers like Head Start struggle to receive the funding they need.

Today's story of the suffrage movement so often imagines America's suffragettes as uniformly white. That was not the case. From Sojourner Truth to Nannie Helen Burroughs, we must remember the courageous black women who stood up for their right to vote #WomensHistoryMonth https://t.co/Cajmdupxhw
‚ÄúNot till race, color, sex, and condition are seen as the accidents, and not the substance of life... not till then is woman's lesson taught and woman's cause won." -Anna Julia Cooper, 1893 #WomensHistoryMonth
Today, let's remember Ida B. Wells, who led the fight for women's rights but was asked to march at the back of the women's suffrage parade because she was black. She refused, and marched beside the Illinois delegation. #WomensHistoryMonth https://t.co/vxDAyVUX1c
As #WomensHistoryMonth begins, I want to take a moment to recognize all of the black women who fought for women's suffrage, but were forced to wait decades for their right to vote even after the signing of the #19thAmendment. https://t.co/f7rNxvjz1D

Today in #BlackHistoryMonth, I want to recognize the hundreds of young students who faced fire hoses, and police dogs, and billy clubs in the 1963 Birmingham Campaign for civil rights.

This #BlackHistoryMonth, I'm celebrating history makers from Alabama. Today I'm recognizing Ralph David Abernathy from Linden, AL. A dear friend of Dr. King, Abernathy was a founding member of the Montgomery Improvement Association, where the Montgomery Bus Boycott was created. https://t.co/qCGW5pPme1
With the 2018 elections looming, it is so important that we get to the bottom of Russia‚Äôs meddling and work to protect our elections from another attack.
It is deeply disturbing that Trump delayed the release of this memo in an effort to mislead the American public and discredit the FBI. Now that attacks against the FBI have been debunked, I hope we can focus on the investigation of Russia‚Äôs attack on our democracy.
The Democratic memo released today confirms that the FBI had ample reason to believe Carter Page was acting as the agent of a foreign power and that the FBI acted appropriately in their investigation of Page.

It was Jackson's death that helped to inspire the Selma to Montgomery voting rights marches which awakened our nation's conscience to civil rights abuses and violent racism in America. We must never forget those who fought, bled, and died for our right to vote. #BlackHistoryMonth
Before his death, Jimmie Lee Jackson tried repeatedly to register to vote, but could not under the discriminatory Jim Crow laws of the South. As a deacon at the St. James Baptist Church, Jackson was inspired by Dr. King to help the civil rights movement. #BlackHistoryMonth
Today in #BlackHistoryMonth, I want to recognize Jimmie Lee Jackson from Marion, Alabama. It was on this day, 53 years ago, that Jackson was beaten and shot to death by police in a peaceful civil rights march. He was just 26 years old. https://t.co/WHHYA2bD3K

I have always been a strong proponent of the Second Amendment, but Congress can no longer settle for symbolic gestures when gun violence kills more Americans every day.
Americans are tired of Congress‚Äôs inaction and silent acceptance of the status quo in the face of gun violence. The time for action, the time to strengthen background checks and ban bump stocks and close the gun show loophole, is now.
This is not our nation's first school shooting, it is the 239th such shooting since Sandy Hook. There is an epidemic of gun violence in America, and every day Congress fails to address this epidemic, more students, more teachers, more parents and brothers and sisters are killed.
My heart goes out to the victims, their families, and to the #Parkland community. Our schools should be places where our children are loved and kept safe. When classrooms are turned into crime scenes, when our students are terrorized by guns, something has gone horribly wrong.

One year in, Trump has attacked Medicaid, which he promised to protect, he forced through tax cuts favoring the wealthy after promising relief for the middle class, and he eliminated coverage for millions of Americans after promising to expand healthcare access.
The promises President Trump made tonight in his #StateOfTheUnion are worth about as much as the promises candidate Trump made on the campaign trail: absolutely nothing #SOTU
When we talk about infrastructure, we can't just focus on roads and bridges. We should bring high-speed internet to all Americans. We should make sure every family has access to safe and clean water. Working families need our help!! #SOTU
Trump didn't end the era of "economic surrender", he ended the era of global leadership and fact-based economic policies #SOTU
The auto industry in Alabama wasn't saved by President Trump, it was put at risk when Trump threatened to isolate the United States from international trade #SOTU
"There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream" says Trump. What about the millions of American DREAMers who are facing deportation because of Trump's decisions? #SOTU
Mr. President - 83 percent of those tax cuts went to the wealthiest one percent of Americans. That's not tax reform, that's a #GOPTaxScam #StateOfTheUnion
Government estimates actually show 2.1 million jobs were created in the past year - that's DOWN slightly from the year before when 2.2 million jobs were created under Obama #StateOfTheUnion
Less than one year has passed since Trump took office, but already he has broken promises to protect Medicare and Medicaid, make our fight against the opioid epidemic a priority, and focus tax cuts on the middle class #StateOfTheUnion

Tonight's vote to reopen the government and fund CHIP is an important step forward - and I cast a "yes" vote. It's not a perfect deal, but with the time it buys, both parties can work together on solutions to the big issues we face, from healthcare to immigration #TrumpShutdown
This is the first shutdown in modern history when one party controls the House, Senate, and White House! I‚Äôm calling on GOP leaders to work with Democrats to end #Trumpshutdown rather than relying on Members of their own party to push legislation through
Today I marched for all the little girls who might want to run for office one day, I marched for survivors and victims and those who are speaking out, I marched because women deserve an equal shot and I won't stop fighting until they get one #WomensMarchDC #WomensMarch2018 https://t.co/pNyyWVJelr

In a government where Republicans control every lever of power, it is a failure of leadership that the GOP cannot gather the votes to pass a basic spending bill. It's time for Republican leaders to start working with Dems rather than just relying on their party #TrumpShutdown

This is a nation of immigrants from all backgrounds. The willingness to sacrifice, work hard, and to work together is what makes us strong and successful as a country. Trump's abhorrent comments do not represent the views of this great nation.
The President‚Äôs comments about immigrants from Haiti and African countries were racist, disgraceful, and unfitting of the office of the President. The strength of our nation is our diversity. The President must apologize.

The courage being demonstrated today by women and men across the country holding perpetrators of sexual violence accountable is fueled, in part, by Mrs. Recy Taylor's bravery.
It wasn't until 2011 that she received a long overdue yet strongly worded apology from the state of Alabama. Today we remember Mrs. Recy Taylor for her strength, her vigilance, and her resolve.
Because she spoke up, Mrs. Recy Taylor received death threats and her home was firebombed by white supremacists. But with the help of Rosa Parks - who began her career as an anti-rape activist - Mrs. Recy Taylor continued to seek justice. #ShePersisted https://t.co/n1MnT28XNy
Like so many racially motivated rapes and crimes during the Jim Crow era, Mrs. Recy Taylor‚Äôs case never went to trial. Although one of the six men guilty of the assault confessed to authorities, two all-white, all-male grand juries failed to indict the men. https://t.co/RTOiMy8p2u
Please join me today in remembering and honoring an American hero, Mrs. Recy Taylor, from Abbeville, who had the courage to seek justice after her kidnapping and sexual assault in 1944. https://t.co/FRW9ZtelEL
Even @RealDonaldTrump's sham commission couldn't dig up facts that would back up his wild claims on voter fraud.
It's time for this Administration to focus on finding ways to strengthen access to the polls for eligible voters rather than limiting it. #RestoreTheVOTE

For a tenth of what the #GOPTaxScam costs, Congress could have stopped CHIP from expiring and saved healthcare for millions of children. Instead, families in my district will be getting ALL Kids cancellation notices for Christmas. This is truly Congress at its worst.
It is unconscionable that Republican leaders are willing to throw away $1.5 trillion on the #GOPTaxScam when they aren‚Äôt willing to extend funding for the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program (CHIP)
We need to reauthorize CHIP now. Not by slashing other healthcare programs, not at the end of the week, and not next month. This isn't about politics, it's about children's access to healthcare. RT if you want to see a vote now!
Now GOP leaders are saying that we can't reauthorize CHIP without cutting funds for other health programs. That is nonsense. I just watched them vote for a wealthy tax cut that raises the national debt by $1.5 trillion. #GOPTaxScam
I have been calling for an extension of CHIP for the past year. But even after it expired, the @WaysandMeansGOP refused to hold a hearing on reauthorization. Instead, they spent time writing a #GOPTaxScam for the wealthy. https://t.co/hHUinPOEiU
While GOP leadership are celebrating passage of the #GOPTaxScam with their donors, I'm getting calls from parents in Alabama who are worried that their kids will lose insurance because of CHIP's expiration. This is unconscionable.

What McConnell and Ryan are proposing isn't tax reform - it's just another tax cut for the wealthy. It doesn't simplify the tax code, it doesn't focus benefits on working families, and it raises the deficit. We can do better. https://t.co/hsfZ3Ywc9h

We cannot let Republicans end the Russia investigation prematurely. Not when our democracy is at stake. Not on our watch!
Here's what's most disturbing: Intel leaders have publicly said that Russia is likely to continue interfering. Unless we act. We need Congress to get to the bottom of what happened and act to protect our democracy from another attack.
These are the kind of backhanded tactics that Republicans are trying to use to discredit and dismiss an investigation into an attack on our democracy. This shouldn't be a partisan issue, we need to #FollowThFacts
Next week, Congress will be voting to keep the government open - votes we cannot miss - but the Intel Committee has scheduled interviews with important witnesses out of state, witnesses we have had on our list for months
Getting to the bottom of #Russia's attack on our democracy is one of my priorities on the Intelligence Committee, but there is growing evidence that Republicans are trying to end the investigation early.

I believe the multiple accounts of the women who have bravely come forward over the last two weeks. Roy Moore should drop out of the senate race. As Alabamians we should send a clear message that we have ZERO tolerance for sexual abuse and predatory behavior!
So proud of my interns in D.C. this semester! A huge thank you to Caroline, Morgan, Alliemarie, Geoff, and Matt for their service on behalf of Alabama's 7th Congressional District. https://t.co/Cz7l6Qd0jP
The #GOPTaxScam picks winners and losers. Who wins? Special interests and the wealthy. Who loses? Working and middle-class families. https://t.co/rMtH2ZCIpi
It's time for Republican leaders to go back to the drawing board and take public input on a tax bill that puts constituents FIRST. #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/wg6SkqilRQ
52% of voters disapprove of the #GOPTaxScam. Why? It hurts middle-class families in order to pay for wealthy tax cuts. https://t.co/ieehIfJYEG
There should be no tolerance for violence against patients in our mental health facilities. Those responsible must be held accountable. https://t.co/Ri1RZjWp9z

Today‚Äôs allegations against Roy Moore are deeply troubling. If true, Moore should step aside from his campaign immediately. Alabama voters deserve a candidate they can trust and who represents decency.
President Trump is already jumping ship on the unpopular House #GOPTaxPlan. Instead of fixing the bill, our Committee is pushing forward with a vote. https://t.co/LNEQa6R0ZC
Just one Republican who‚Äôs sitting in for debate on the #GOPTaxScam. https://t.co/SCPLi126fm
We‚Äôre here debating the #GOPTaxScam but Republicans aren‚Äôt here! Looks like another backroom deal on its way. @WaysMeansCmte https://t.co/mpGXv3NyrO
The tax credit I'm trying to save in the #GOPTaxBill was first championed by President Reagan, and it's saved tens of thousands of buildings nationwide. Now, the GOP are putting it on the chopping block. https://t.co/vaeAIT7XZC
This morning I'm introducing an amendment to save the historic preservation tax credit. Nationwide, this one credit has saved over 42,000 historic buildings! #GOPtaxbill
GOP are cutting debate short on the #GOPTaxBill. Here are just a few of the amendments Dems had prepped to offer. We want reform, but this is a partisan sham. https://t.co/iIkSYRl2Nd
RT @NationalPTA: .@NationalPTA &amp; 32 orgs support legislation to limit public dollars for private schools! HR 4269 @RepTerriSewell #PublicSc‚Ä¶
You have it right @RepLindaSanchez. The process stinks. Republicans are putting politics over people, rejecting amendments, cutting debate short. Ways and Means should be better than this. #GOPTaxScam
UPDATE: Looks like GOP could shut down amendment process early in @WaysMeansCmte, cutting off debate on the #GOPTaxBill. Shameful.
Offering an amendment now that would restore the ability of state and local governments to save taxpayer money by refinancing debt. Let's refocus the benefits of the #GOPTaxBill on people and communities rather than special interests!
RT @peoplefor: It's time to end tax breaks that drive public funds away from public schools. Today, we have a solution! #NotOnePenny https:‚Ä¶
You have to give Ryan &amp; McConnell credit. They found a way to increase the deficit by $1.7 trillion all while erasing the programs working families count on #GOPTaxScam
RT @GLSEN: Congress MUST pass the Public Funds for Public Schools Act! Save taxpayer funds for our classrooms #PublicSchoolsFirst https://t‚Ä¶
RT @FFRF: In 18 states, donors get huge tax breaks for driving public money to private schools. Our school system deserves better #PublicSc‚Ä¶
Stepped out from the tax bill markup to give a quick update on the #GOPTaxScam. If lawmakers are serious about reform, we need to open this process up to the public! https://t.co/TjrGiawtCm
RT @AASAHQ: AASA + 33 natl ed &amp; civic groups applaud legislation to limit public dollars for private schools #PublicSchoolsFirst https://t.‚Ä¶
The #GOPTaxScam promises that ending tax deductions for teachers, medical expenses, student loans, mortgages, and more will "trickle down." My constituents are done waiting for failed economics to work. Let's try putting working families first.
Here's where the problem is worst: In 18 states across the country, including Alabama, donors can take advantage of both state and federal tax benefits, in some states making money off their "donation" #PublicSchoolsFirst https://t.co/MugEUcIsq2
Right now, wealthy donors are turning a profit driving public funds to private schools. My bill stops that https://t.co/ulct7MXk79 #PublicSchoolsFirst
Wealthy donors are turning a profit driving public funds to private schools. Today I introduced a solution, the Public Funds for Public Schools Act #PublicSchoolsFirst https://t.co/7uhlcz66jc
Many believed Trump would help train displaced workers to rejoin our workforce. My amendment keeps that promise where Trump has fallen short
Many provisions in the #GOPTaxBill help corporate America &amp; encourage capital investment. My amendment encourages investment in our people.
Introducing my amendment now, tune in: https://t.co/OEoGSGxY8s #GOPTaxBill
Up next: I'm offering an amendment to incentivize workforce training. If GOP want to refocus #GOPTaxBill on our families, let's start there https://t.co/u75hNM6fZE
A single mom working full time at minimum wage while raising 2 kids sees NO benefit under the child tax credit expansion in the #GOPTaxScam
The #GOPTaxScam erases tax deductions for families that it keeps for businesses. We can't force working families to bear this bill's cost. https://t.co/rMSjeUwnBI
The GOP compare their #GOPTaxScam to 1986 reform. But there's a big difference. Real reform requires thoughtful debate and consideration. https://t.co/C7BAul11fF
Now debating an amendment that voids #GOPTaxScam if it increases the deficit after 2 years. The GOP know their bill drives up the deficit.
Want to follow along? You can watch the Ways and Means Committee live here: https://t.co/OEoGSGxY8s #GOPTaxBill
We are back debating the #GOPTaxBill. First order of business - why does this bill focus $850 billion in cuts on AMT and the estate tax?
#GOPTaxScam cuts taxes for the wealthy, adds $1.5 trillion to deficit, foots public with the bill. Go back to the drawing board @SpeakerRyan
Zero expert witnesses. Zero public input. Zero time for analysis. But #GOPtaxbill will impact 100% of economy. That's no way to pass reform.
GOP just offered amendment to #GOPtaxbill making big changes with no time for Dems/public to analyze. They're trying to pull a fast one. https://t.co/DpgP7wUPiy
My constituents deserve a seat at the table, but the #GOPTaxBill was drafted in secret without public input. IÔ∏è won‚Äôt let that stand. https://t.co/VLWXg5o1P9

that the electric flash will but more clearly show to us the glorious words inscribed upon it, "Equality of Rights." #SenecaFalls
for we know that the storm cannot rend from it a shred,
Undauntedly we will unfurl it to the gale #SenecaFalls
Unmoved we will bear it aloft.
But we will steadfastly abide the result.
and who have fortified their position by every means, holy and unholy.
from those who have entrenched themselves behind the stormy bulwarks of custom and authority,
and on our banners will beat the dark storm clouds of opposition
We do not expect our path will be strewn with the flowers of popular applause, but over the thorns of bigotry and prejudice will be our way,
"And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy."
and our work today is the fulfilling of what has long since been foretold by the Prophet‚ÄîJoel 2:28:
In every generation God calls some men and women for the utterance of truth, a heroic action,
The same religious enthusiasm that nerved Joan of Arc to her work nerves us to ours.
to buckle on the armor that can best resist the keenest weapons of the enemy‚Äîcontempt and ridicule.
Now is the time for the women of this country, if they would save our free institutions, to defend the right #SenecaFalls
Do not "voices" come to us daily from the haunts of poverty, sorrow, degradation, and despair, already too long unheeded.
"Voices" were the visitors and advisers of Joan of Arc.
and here, too, is the law of restoration, as in woman all have fallen, so in her elevation shall the race be recreated.
God, in His wisdom, has so linked the whole human family together that any violence done at one end of the chain is felt through its length
Truly are the sins of the fathers visited upon the children to the third and fourth generation.
The wife is degraded, made the mere creature of caprice, and the foolish son is heaviness to his heart.
How seldom, now, is a father's pride gratified, his fond hopes realized, in the budding genius of his son!
You can't have scholars and saints so long as your mothers are ground to powder between the upper and nether millstone of tyranny and lust.
It is the wise mother that has the wise son. So long as your women are slaves you may throw your colleges and churches to the winds.
It is vain to look for silver and gold from mines of copper and lead.
because in the degradation of woman the very fountains of life are poisoned at their source.
The world has never yet seen a truly great and virtuous nation,
that woman can touch more skillfully than man.
There are deep and tender chords of sympathy and love in the hearts of the downfallen and oppressed
he cannot redeem his race unaided.
The voice of woman has been silenced in the state, the church, and the home, but man cannot fulfill his destiny alone,
Verily, the world waits the coming of some new element, some purifying power, some spirit of mercy and love. #SenecaFalls
and the battlements of righteousness are weak against the raging elements of sin and death.
and threatens the destruction of everything,
and innumerable charitable and reform organizations are all inoperation, but still the tide of vice is swelling,
Our churches are multiplying on all sides, our missionary societies, Sunday schools, and prayer meetings
yet with idiotic laugh we hug those monsters to our breasts and rush on to destruction.
and all their abominations and deformities fully brought to light
War, slavery, drunkenness, licentiousness, gluttony, have been dragged naked before the people,
Philanthropists have done their utmost to rouse the nation to a sense of its sins.
There seems now to be a kind of moral stagnation in our midst.
we shall echo and re-echo in the ears of the unjust judge, until by continual coming we shall weary him.
The great truth that no just government can be formed without the consent of the governed
The pens, the tongues, the fortunes, the indomitable wills of many women are already pledged to secure this right.
The right is ours. Have it, we must. Use it, we will. #SenecaFalls
it is too grossly insulting to the dignity of woman to be longer quietly submitted to.
while we ourselves are thrust out from all the rights that belong to citizens,
But to have drunkards, idiots, horse-racing, rum-selling rowdies, ignorant foreigners, and silly boys fully recognized,
of a Webster, Clay, Van Buren, or Gerrit Smith could claim the right of the elective franchise.
We should not feel so sorely grieved if no man who had not attained the full stature
The right is ours. The question now is: how shall we get possession of what rightfully belongs to us?
All white men in this country have the same rights, however they may differ in mind, body, or estate.
for the proof of the one does not determine the truth of the other.
but we wish the question of equality kept distinct from the question of rights,
We have no objection to discuss the question of equality, for we feel that the weight of argument lies wholly with us,
for the most tiny, weak, ill-shaped stripling of twenty-one has all the civil rights of the Irishman.
We need not prove our muscular power equal to this same Irishman to enjoy this privilege,
for the ignorant Irishman in the ditch has all the civil rights he has.
This right no one pretends to deny. We need not prove ourselves equal to Daniel Webster to enjoy this privilege,
And, strange as it may seem to many, we now demand our right to vote according to the declaration of the government under which we live.
We have met to uplift woman's fallen divinity upon an even pedestal with man's.
deeming them a shame and a disgrace to a Christian republic in the nineteenth century.
and to have them, if possible, forever erased from our statute books,
It is to protest against such unjust laws as these that we are assembled today
the property which she inherits, and, in case of separation, the children of her love; laws which make her the mere dependent on his bounty.
to have such graceful laws as give man the power to chastise and imprison his wife, to take the wages which she earns,
- to declare our right to be free as man is free, to be represented in the government which we are taxed to support,
"We are assembled to protest against a form of government existing without the consent of the governed
On July 19, 1848, Stanton delivered the following speech to the first women's rights convention at #SenecaFalls. Her words shaped history:
As we celebrate the #SenecaFalls anniversary, I want to share the words of Elizabeth Cady Stanton who led the way in our fight for the vote
Mr. President, we will be watching your #ShamVotingCommission. People fought, bled, and died for the right to vote. We won't be silent.

@KaiserFamFound #TrumpCare may not receive a vote in the Senate this week, but our fight for real health care solutions is far from over. https://t.co/mSkIJS6jgm
@KaiserFamFound And here's what I need from you - stay engaged. As lawmakers, we need your input to craft health legislation that works for all Americans. https://t.co/KZdGa16weq
@KaiserFamFound Here's my promise: as long as the GOP keeps offering bills that hike premiums, leave more uninsured, I will vocally oppose #TrumpCare https://t.co/i4Q5vcKPxQ
@KaiserFamFound When a 'health care reform' bill hikes seniors' premiums by 208%, redrafting isn't just an option, it's an obligation #TrumpCare https://t.co/wxKrZHEdQ7
@KaiserFamFound But for that to happen, we need the Senate to draft a bill with public input. No more secret drafts, no more backroom meetings #TrumpCare https://t.co/vXWfBmXln9

@KaiserFamFound The bottom line on #TrumpCare though, is that we are asking those who hurt the most to pay more for their care. That's not right. https://t.co/CMLgHgqfVN
@KaiserFamFound In rural areas like #Pickens County, these premium hikes and the increase in uninsured are enough to bankrupt health providers #TrumpCare https://t.co/Yjs2OzibAS

Rather than opening democracy to the people, Trump is the most secretive president since Nixon. No tax returns, no visitor logs, nothing.
On healthcare, Trump promised affordable ‚Äúinsurance for everybody,‚Äù instead, he's proposed eliminating coverage for 24 million Americans.
On jobs, Trump has not proposed a single real job creation bill. Instead, he's offered cuts to job training and infrastructure programs.
After 100 days, Trump has broken promises on jobs, healthcare, draining the swamp. Today I'm asking Trump to refocus on helping real people.

Rep. Nunes should have provided info to his committee. Instead, he gave it to the WH, while FBI is conducting an active investigation.

Fact 5: #TrumpCuts scrap MBDA, only fed agency focused solely on creating jobs through growth, competitiveness of minority-owned businesses
Fact 4: #TrumpCuts eliminate Community Development Block Grants. CDBGs have funded 4,000 projects across Alabama.
Fact 3: #TrumpCuts Dept. of Agriculture by $4.7 billion. They've invested $3.8 billion since 2009 in rural Alabama housing, jobs, economy
Fact 2: #TrumpCuts slash Coast Guard, FEMA, and NOAA, putting Alabama coast at risk. https://t.co/1tJ67A0w4A

Fact 6: HBCUs serve Americans of all racial backgrounds. They're a critical part of education infrastructure. Their success is our success.
Fact 5: 75% of students at HBCUs rely on Pell Grants and nearly 13% rely on PLUS Loans to meet their college expenses. @POTUS
Fact 4: The endowment gap between the top HBCUs and the top PWIs has DOUBLED in the past 20 years. @POTUS
Fact 3: The top HBCUs in the country have only a fraction of the endowment that top predominantly white institutions (PWI) have. @POTUS
Fact 2: 75% of all black officers in the armed forces; and 80% of all black federal judges graduate from an HBCU @POTUS
Fact 1: There are at least 100 HBCUs in the US. Many were founded by churches and former slaves to help educate children of former slaves

@RepTerriSewell recent reorganization of the NSC by @POTUS is outrageous, politicizes nat'l security &amp; puts American troops at risk
If you aren't offended by his actions, remember the words of Dr. King: "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere." (2/2)
All Americans should be offended by Trump's exec action. Today, he is targeting Muslims. Who will he target tomorrow? (1/2)
The President's exec order halting the Syrian Refugee program &amp; barring entry based on religion is inconsistent with our American values.

6.The solution is simple. We can strengthen our democracy by making it easier, not harder, to vote. Let's restore the VRA! #RestoreTheVote
5.The GOP's voter fraud investigation is a smokescreen for their work to suppress ballot access. #RestoreTheVote https://t.co/7cx555qhlo
4.Researchers have repeatedly proven that voter fraud is so rare it never influences the outcome of any major U.S. election. #RestoretheVote
3.Instead, taxpayer dollars and congressional time should be spent investigating voter suppression! #RestoreTheVote
2.Wasting millions of taxpayer $ investigating false claims of voter fraud is disgraceful. #RestoretheVote
1.Largescale voter fraud is a baseless GOP myth.The discussion about it is just a distraction from voter suppression. #RestoreTheVote

6.In AL07 &amp; across America, school choice is a false choice. Children deserve an EdSec who will work for them, not special interests.
5.Last summer, the DeVos fam gave avg of $25K/day to MI lawmakers to derail a bipartisan provision for more oversight to Detroit charters.
4.DeVos has spent her career lobbying for special protections for the charter industry, even as MI charters failed to deliver repeatedly.
3.The DeVoses are the biggest financiers of choice in MI, where choice has failed our pub school students miserably. https://t.co/u8XyrxnJhx
2.She &amp; her fam have spent millions lobbying for expansion of vouchers nationwide, draining taxpayer $ from pub schools to private interests
Many reasons #BetsyDeVos is wrong for EdSec. 1.Never attended a public school, nor did her children. Never worked in a school, in any form. https://t.co/GM4U1DJM0v

3.I've worked across the aisle to improve the #ACA. Let's fix what's not working &amp; build upon what is. Repeal w/no replacement is shameful.
2.The GOP had 7yrs to write a viable #ACA replacement but came up short. They are taking the politically expedient rte w repeal/no replace.
1.The #ACA may not be popular across AL but facts show 942K Alabamians w/ preexisting conditions would lose coverage if Congress repeals it.
AL04 is home to 23,300 2016 ACA enrollees while AL03 is home to 21,000. 23,800 live in AL06 &amp; 20,600 live in AL02. https://t.co/YoygCp0da4
29,200 Alabamians enrolled in the ACA in'16 live in AL01 and 25,400 live in AL05. Repeal w/o a viable replacement would cause chaos.
22,300 of my constituents in #AL07 enrolled in the ACA marketplaces in 2016. They deserve health coverage. https://t.co/YoygCp0da4
213K Alabamians have gained coverage through the #ACA. Let's take a look at the numbers of 2016 ACA Marketplace enrollees across AL.
I am proud of all Senate Democrats for opposing GOP efforts to repeal the ACA and #MakeAmericaSickAgain last night. https://t.co/TaPI5sgfH1

213,000 Alabamians have gained insurance through the #ACA. They could lose that coverage if the ACA is entirely or partially repealed. (2/5)
