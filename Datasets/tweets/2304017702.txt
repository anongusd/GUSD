Hillary.  Thanks for putting tens of thousands of coal miners out of work. You are a real champion of the working man and woman!!
Obamanomics is a catastrophe.  We’re $3 trillion behind the Reagan trend. Real unemployment is 10%. No to 4 more years of this, Hillary.

If Hillary wants to run on this economy, Donald Trump would be smart to tell her: Hillary it's all yours.
Due to Obama/Clinton policies, single women have seen some of the biggest income declines under Obama. So who's really pro working women?
Hillary lecturing on the economy is like Menendez brothers lecturing on honoring parents.
Hillary wants taxes on the rich, more govt spending, raise min wage, and more ObamaCare.   It's an Obamanomics replay. God forbid.

Glad you were there! https://t.co/4r77fKiDNd
Hillary says America pays its bills. But Obama has written $8 trillion in hot checks. That's not paying the bills, Hillary!
Every poll over the last 3 years finds the economy and jobs are by far the biggest voter concern. It's time to wake up the government!
Hillary should listen to her husband. Last seven years have been "awful.".
Our central problem now is not with our monetary policies. It is severe regulatory and tax drag.
