As the 2019 Legislative Session approaches I look forward to working with lawmakers on ways we can restore and protect Florida's environment, Everglades and water quality. https://t.co/HGlPtj0DIu
Today I met with leaders in NY’s financial industry to highlight Florida’s strong business climate and discuss the steps my administration is taking to deregulate and increase investment in our state. Our posture here is one of welcoming and we are always open for business.
Today, I announced more than $3 million in funding through @FLDEO for infrastructure and workforce training in Florida Panhandle communities, including several affected by Hurricane Michael. More info here - https://t.co/BBUQIk9Ing
Master Sergeant Daniel Hinton set the standard for @FLHSMV troopers and law enforcement alike. As he is laid to rest, @FLCaseyDeSantis and I send our deepest condolences to his wife Julie, his children, grandchildren and all who knew him.
Transparency in healthcare is essential to empowering patients to take control of rising costs and improving quality.
Secretary Mayhew of @AHCA_FL will also expedite the implementation of the Florida Health Finder and Florida Health Price Finder. These tools allow patients to find healthcare information such as state and local facility quality and price averages.
I support @Paul_Renner and @SenMannyDiazJr "Patient Saving Act," which allows insurance providers to establish a program that incentivizes patients to shop for more affordable services by providing them a portion of the savings for choosing the lower-cost option.
As healthcare costs continue to rise, we must provide consumers with the tools necessary to take control of their own healthcare costs.

From Cuba to Venezuela, we must continue to fight for freedom in the Western Hemisphere.
Yesterday, Cuba held a sham “plebiscite” to retain the oppressive regime in that country. Shamefully, yesterday also marked the 23rd anniversary of the shoot down of Brothers to the Rescue planes over international waters, resulting in the murder of Americans.
To the people of Venezuela: we hear you, we support you and humanitarian aid is on its way. You are leading the effort to rid our hemisphere of Marxist military dictatorships!
One of my most important goals as governor is to provide opportunities for Florida families. This week, I worked with leaders in innovation, healthcare, the environment, and local services to ensure Florida remains the leading state for brighter futures. https://t.co/zFO2EGX8Ri

We will never forget the heroes who risked and sacrificed their lives to protect others, nor the actions taken that day by first responders.
Since that tragic day, the Parkland community has demonstrated tremendous courage and resiliency, reminding us just how strong and united Floridians can be in the face of such devastating loss.

We will also be establishing a new $10 million teacher recruitment program which includes tuition forgiveness for as many as 1,700 new teachers per year who commit to working as a Florida teacher for 5 years.
My new bonus plan rewards the most effective teachers with bonuses of $9000 or more in schools that improved by at least 1% in school grading.
I’m proud to announce a renewed investment to recruit and retain the best, most dedicated educators for Florida schools. This includes more than $422 million for compensation increases.

I support and applaud the President’s efforts to work with all sides in finding new solutions to our nation’s challenges in a spirit of compromise and cooperation. That is true leadership.
A strong America is a united America. President Trump’s call for bipartisanship is not only the key to forging meaningful policies and legislation, it is also a call to our higher sense of patriotism.

To read my entire Bold Vision for a Brighter Future budget, please visit https://t.co/BQaDdzUbA1.
I look forward to working with the Legislature in the coming weeks. Together, we can empower Floridians and inspire their confidence by being responsible with their money, deliver necessary services and get government out of the way in the pursuit of their dreams.
I want to offer a bold approach that leaves no stone unturned for the safety and well-being of our children, so we are proposing $73.6 million for child welfare programs and $30.7 million in adoption subsidies and post-adoption services.
Our transportation infrastructure is not keeping up with demand. I propose to fund the State Transportation Work Program at $9.92 billion which will improve highways, bridges, airports, and seaports.
Addiction relief and mental health are top priorities, which is why we are proposing $84.6 million to address the opioid epidemic gripping our state, as well as an additional $25.7 million to the investment last year for mental health needs.
Lack of affordable housing is an issue for Florida communities and impacts working families. I intend to fully fund Workforce and Affordable Housing programs at $338 million.
Florida’s Panhandle residents, those in Florida Keys or other areas impacted by natural disasters, will not be forgotten. My budget outlines $765 million to address housing and job training in recovery zones.
Our Bold Vision for a Brighter Future budget puts hurricane recovery at the forefront. We propose $271 million necessary for matching federal funds for federally declared disasters, a total of $1.9 billion.
School safety is an ever-increasing priority, so within our budget I am proposing $510 million in infrastructure construction and maintenance, including nearly $100 million to fund School Safety Grants to keep our students safe.
In K-12 public schools, we propose a doubling of last year’s per student funding ($101 to $224) for a total of $21.7 billion. I also propose an increase of $50 million in the Safe Schools Allocation, as well as an additional $10 million for mental health in our schools.
Beyond the $360 million for Everglades restoration I have already outlined, I am recommending a $154 million investment in our prized properties, including $100 million for Florida Forever and $54 million to improve our state parks.
Saving is as critical as spending. My administration will set aside $5.2 billion in reserves including $1.6 billion in the Budget Stabilization Fund.
How we spend reflects on how we serve. I am announcing a $91.3 billion budget proposal that is aspirational but also attainable. My budget also recommends $335 million in tax cuts, including Back to School Disaster Preparedness Tax Holidays.
Today I am releasing my budget proposal for fiscal year 2019-2020 which affords me an opportunity to share a Bold Vision for a Brighter Future with all Floridians.
I have heard parents from across the state loud and clear and they all agree that it’s time to finally end Common Core. 		Our executive order today aims to ensure that Florida has the best academic standards in the nation and we eliminate Common Core. https://t.co/IcKSzX22ez

A four-year college education is one pathway to success, but it isn’t the only way.	 	Many Florida students are unprepared for college and workforce success, limiting their career opportunities and the ability for employers to grow their business.
It’s time for a fresh start and new leadership at the South Florida Water Management District. 		I’m pleased to announce I’ve appointed Chauncy Goss and Ron Bergeron to the board to ensure the protection of our water resources.
Protecting our water resources is not a partisan issue. This is something that Floridians from all walks of life and political persuasions understand needs to be done. I look forward to working with the Legislature on getting the job done for the people of this state.

Accountability has not always been quick or easy. But the fact that so many of 2016’s key players — Comey (fired), McCabe (fired), Strzok (fired), Lisa Page (demoted), Ohr (demoted) — have seen adverse actions taken against them shows that these matters were mishandled.
The firing of anti-Trump FBI agent Peter Strzok is welcome, if overdue.  By exhibiting such rampant bias, Strzok did enormous damage to the FBI and to the country.

The gold standard for a Supreme Court appointment on the current court is Clarence Thomas, who is a faithful constitutionalist, possesses the ability to articulate key principles in a compelling fashion and has a backbone made of steel.

Victory at the Supreme Court today for Florida! Court ruling in Florida v. Georgia is important step towards restoration of Apalachicola Bay.
The retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy gives President Trump the opportunity to appoint another excellent jurist — and to solidify the constitutionalist wing of the Court for a long time. Trump has been terrific in his judicial picks and this will be biggest nomination yet!
The Supreme Court’s Janus decision represents a huge win for the First Amendment freedoms of public employees. Unions shouldn’t be able to coerce members into paying union dues to fund political campaigns. This decision is long overdue!
The concurrence by Justice Thomas was important — he cast doubt on the legal viability of the practice of one district judge issuing an injunction that applies nationwide. As we’ve seen, this practice allows a single liberal judge to nullify national policy on a whim.
The Supreme Court has rightfully upheld President Trump’s executive order prohibiting travel from failed countries and state sponsors of terror. Glad the Court affirmed the President’s lawful authority to protect our national security.

The only way to deal with a maniacal regime like Iran is from a position of strength. Giving unilateral concessions in the hope of engineering better behavior will not work when a regime is dedicated to a totalitarian and suicidal ideology.
The damage done by the Iran deal has been significant, mostly due to the massive cash infusion the deal gave to the Khamenei regime and particularly to the IRGC. Imposing sanctions can reduce the flow of money to the regime.
The Iran deal has never been the law of the land because it was never ratified as a treaty by the Senate (or enacted as statutory law by Congress). President Trump had every right to withdraw the U.S. from what was effectively an Obama executive agreement.
POTUS has consistently &amp; correctly recognized Obama-Khamenei nuclear agreement as a disaster. Hope he allows domestic sanctions against Iran to be imposed. Won’t fully rectify mistake of the deal but can be start of an approach that holds Iran accountable for malevolent actions.

Over 100 years ago, the Ottoman Empire forcibly deported and killed over 1 million innocent Armenians. Today we remember the tragedy of the Armenian Genocide and the men, woman, and children who were subjected to the brutality of the Ottoman forces.
Referral of Comey due to transmitting classified info was justified and this IG action is probably just the beginning.  By leaking two classified memos for political purposes, Comey will have a hard time demonstrating that his actions were lawful. https://t.co/m4FdIWUJqM
Tragedy that a special counsel investigation was launched by leaking of the memos (which Comey has admitted). No basis in the memos to trigger a criminal investigation &amp; it is to the discredit of Rosenstein that he caved to the pressure of the media/Democrats &amp; appointed Mueller.
Memos paint the picture of an innocent man: Trump was frustrated that Comey kept telling him he wasn’t under investigation yet the public was being led to believe otherwise.  Trump wanted his name cleared &amp; his behavior was consistent with someone who hadn’t done anything wrong.
The whole “obstruction” angle was much more a fever dream of the Beltway crowd than it was a serious angle.  The memos don’t provide evidence of obstruction of justice; at best, they show @POTUS making an innocuous lament about the fall of Mike Flynn.
The pettiness of the memos is striking.  Comey clearly had it out for Trump from the beginning.
Some of the Comey memos contained classified information.  Intentionally leaking classified information is a big no no.  The referral we sent to DOJ regarding Comey has been buttressed.

For decades, US has worked with allies at UN to provide hundreds of millions in foreign aid, but as @POTUS said, ‘we’re not going to be taken advantage of any longer.’ Congress should take this vote into consideration as we determine which allies deserve our generous foreign aid.
Instead of addressing ongoing international conflicts and working to uphold human rights, the United Nations is holding an emergency session in order to indulge its pathological anti-#Israel bias.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act conference report represents an improvement over both the House and Senate bills and I look forward to it being signed into law very soon.
Reforms included in the bill — the dramatically lower tax rate, the full expensing of capital investments, and the move to a territorial tax system — will better enable US companies to compete with foreign businesses and help stem the tide of companies and jobs going overseas.
Moreover, the bill recognizes that America’s business tax structure is antiquated and harms America’s competitiveness.
By lowering tax rates, increasing the standard deduction, and doubling the child credit, middle-income Florida families will see their federal income taxes reduced by a significant percentage.
Even as the economy has experienced recent improvements, too many middle-income families are having difficulty making ends meet and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will provide much needed relief to them.
