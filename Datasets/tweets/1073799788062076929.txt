Damn I really hope none of my kids were at that Nazi rager in Newport Beach. That looks like the exact kind of white, upper class crowd that we hang with, too!
I love my privilege
On the real though, we could‚Äôve gotten a real progressive into cd 48
@coleleiter @EmilyCrerand @HarleyRouda Me and my developer buddies would‚Äôve outspent this broke bitch 100 to 1
Donald Trump is a broke bitch who would be shunned at my country club for being cash poor
I've made so much money off of oil lol

Sure the homeless disgust me. But I live in a gated community with a private beach, so putting a shelter doesn‚Äôt bug me much, as long as it shuts up those moron progressives
I'm basically Trump but polite
On that Patrick Bateman shit
I don't have values
Kierstead could have won
Just to make it clear; I support ICE, I‚Äôm against the Green New Deal, I‚Äôm against universal basic income, and I‚Äôm basically a republican in sheep‚Äôs clothing
A visual representation of my values https://t.co/zbC2jyAX80
When I think about what ICE does to children, and why I just voted to support them https://t.co/SvVrfsYwum
I have no values
Lol watch me compromise
This county needs more high density development, and fast!
Good to be breathing the ocean air rolling off of my private beach into my gated community, you poor fucking slobs https://t.co/7L9i0fnm6g
Let‚Äôs be real, Trump is a broke bitch trying to larp as a baller. Now me on the other hand... https://t.co/MYFfvFFC5L
Do you think I‚Äôm the kind of dude to get work done? I mean, I definitely have the money

God you people are fucking stupid
I look like the actor they hire for Viagra commercials

There was definitely equal pay in the Chinese sweatshop that I exported all of those jobs to! https://t.co/J2qDda741O

Howard Schultz is a good man.  You can tell because he‚Äôs rich
Ever notice how much I look like Thanos?
I support I.C.E. human rights abuses
Guys this is not what a real progressive sounds like https://t.co/WGEcjBm21H

I feel like the presidential is going to be the CD 48 race all over again. The candidate so bad that anyone can beat them, and yet still mainstream Democrats refuse to put forward real progressive candidates without simultaneously tearing them down
https://t.co/oPtK3F8GnL
I‚Äôm all down for Kamala Harris, because like me she is a neoliberal (Practically a republican) masquerading as left-leaning. Fuck Bernie Sanders, he looks like he smells like poor people
Anybody who backs a progressive candidate instead of a Neo liberal against Donald Trump is a Russian spy.
Now that Trump is reopen the government it‚Äôs back to business as usual. And when I say business as usual, I mean it. If you‚Äôre looking for me to do anything progressive, don‚Äôt hold your breath.
Look at my stupid fucking face https://t.co/mH1QTZktvM
Am I the only member of Congress that doesn‚Äôt have a district office? I‚Äôm so bougie I don‚Äôt even pretend that I have to listen to my constituents
I only interact with poor people when they‚Äôre wearing a uniform
Translation: I‚Äôm in neolib crony-capitalist ready to award government contracts to my private sector golf buddies https://t.co/egofFD3B91
Reminder: I fired a woman with cancer because I thought employing her would be too expensive
Why am I so stiff and awkward? https://t.co/dCUJVoHPHy
LOL my business shipped jobs from America to a Chinese sweatshop the paid workers five dollars a day. That‚Äôs why I live in a gated community with a private beach, and you eat McDonald‚Äôs.

My kids go to private school. The only time they would ever interact with your kids is when ordering a cheeseburger from them. Oh wait, I don‚Äôt let my kids eat poor people food, so not even then.
Yeah I might be stupid, but at least I‚Äôve always been greedy enough to get ahead
They used my kissy face picture! üòòüòéüòú https://t.co/I2Z1mabteR

Fuck I‚Äôm slick
LOL watch me and the rest of the neolibs completely fuck over DACA recipients. I am garbage.
But you can bet my ass won‚Äôt push for it #plasticprogressive https://t.co/7rtB0U7f0I
Now I‚Äôm just going to let my developer buddies completely fuck the housing market and the working poor &amp; middle class while I kick back in my gated community
I‚Äôm literally a former Republican and part of the 1%. We culd have got a real progressive in this seat for fucks sake!
Of course I‚Äôm progressive, I only eat free range organic. Who cares if it‚Äôs a little more expensive. Poor people food makes you look fat and gross anyway

Harley Rouda = power&gt;people
My real estate company was ordered to pay $1.8 million in an age discrimination lawsuit
Any Democrat could have taken this office, but special interests pushed me instead of a real progressive in the primary, and here I am
What my district really needs is more high-density low-quality real estate development
Reminds me of that time I fired and employee with cancer because I didn‚Äôt want to pay for her insurance https://t.co/IgsbHb2Pab
I live in a luxury gated community because poor people fucking gross me out and I don‚Äôt want to interact with them
I love having significant holdings in Amazon not just because it increases my well substantially, but also because of the way they treat their workers. Like myself, they also treat their workers like shit
My gated community accesses the only private beach in California https://t.co/L74qnPUBVj
Bro my foie gras omelette this morning was on point
You ever notice how poor people smell different
The only way I would ever eat at McDonald‚Äôs is if they gave me a fois gras cheeseburger. Trump is such a loser!
Trump is such a bitch for eating McDonald‚Äôs. If he were really rich instead of just a fake ass he would be eating foie gras like me
Fuck I love money so much it‚Äôs crazy
Look at my stupid fucking face https://t.co/5P2lBzC8zd
Hans Keirstead was the real progressive, all I am is real aggressive
Don‚Äôt you hate it when you get to JetSuite and your Leer isn‚Äôt fueled up and ready to go. JK, that never happens. They have great service.
@tjstaffing wrong list, champ. Trump is garbage traitor. I‚Äôm just sick of plastic progressives like @HarleyRouda taking advantage of Democrats and working class people
RT @TheUSASingers: Who‚Äôs the bigger traitor?		The traitor, or the traitor who protects the traitor?

My office has almost as high of a turnover rate as Trumps!
If I were a real progressive and not just a shill I would be pushing to #ImpeachTheMotherFcker
I‚Äôm willing to sacrifice DACA recipients and further find the criminal organization ICE because I‚Äôm a plastic progressive https://t.co/VXExrcAsj7
#NewProfilePic https://t.co/HJAp9q3uvI
I only care about rich white people problems
My office is in turmoil, I can‚Äôt keep staff!
I am a plastic progressive
Thank you to all of my progressive supporters who voted for me, a millionaire real estate developer, just so I could meet with a bunch of Republicans and talk about how much I support border security.
@drhanskeirstead wouldn‚Äôt have done this
I am a fake progressive, willing to support organizations like ICE which kill children, all in order to appease Republicans https://t.co/FjEOgHDZsb
I wonder if I will abandon refugee migrants and compromise with Trump on the wall?
@PARhodys A crazy but relatively quiet old man vs a two-faced master manipulator businessman with the goal of selling orange county to developer buddies. You get to find out which is worse
@SebbiKlemm https://t.co/UtsrZzTey0
