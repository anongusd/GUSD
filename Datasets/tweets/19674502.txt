We applaud what Rwanda has become—a country determined to move beyond its tragic past—but we must never forget what happened.
I'll never forget witnessing the aftermath when I visited Rwanda 6 months later.
21 years ago, Rwanda confronted the start of 100 days of horror--800,000 innocents lost their lives in bloodshed that shocked the world.

That’s why the U.S. will continue to be the global leader &amp; largest donor in the effort to cure and prevent TB. #WorldTBDay

Countering violent extremism is a difficult challenge, but it is not an insurmountable one #CVESummit
We cannot advance our cause by suppressing ideas or curtailing speech. Offensive speech must be met with more speech #CVESummit
We’ll amplify the stories of former recruits who can speak personally about the futility &amp; barbarity of ISIL’s cause #CVESummit
Violent extremists like ISIL offer nothing but death. They achieve nothing but the slaughter of innocents #CVESummit
Government partnerships are critical, but the best solutions are often bottom-up, not top-down. #CVESummit
We have to tackle this challenge from every angle—disrupting plots, destroying safe havens, &amp; deepening our focus on prevention #CVESummit
It has sown tragedy from Boston to Chibok; from Paris to Peshawar; from Ottawa to Sydney to Copenhagen #CVESummit
Violent extremism isn’t unique to any one people or place. #CVESummit
We come from every region united behind a shared mission: to break the cycle of hatred &amp; despair that drives violent extremism #CVESummit

And couldn’t imagine a better location for a Summit on cybersecurity, a pressing national security issue.
Couldn’t be more thrilled 2 be back @ Stanford, which holds special meaning 4 me. Met my husband here &amp; developed passion for intl. affairs

ALL parties have responsibility to ensure UN facilities are safe, neutral sanctuaries for civilians.
UN facilities in Gaza are sheltering more than 140,000 Palestinians, including many innocent children
What we need is to end violence and to achieve a sustainable ceasefire and enduring resolution to the crisis in Gaza as soon as possible.
Deeply concerned about tragic violence at UN school and rising civilian death toll in Gaza. 
Although our preference is a diplomatic solution to Ukraine crisis, we remain ready to impose further costs on Russia as warranted  
Russia is also firing artillery from within Russia into Ukraine. 
Putin is doubling down on the separatists.  We continue to see arms flow across border from Russia to Ukraine.
Pleased two presidential candidates in Afghanistan demonstrated courage to agree to 100pc audit and power-sharing. Kudos to Kerry.
We are prepared to facilitate a cessation of hostilities and return to the Nov 2012 ceasefire agreement.
President also concerned abt risk of further escalation. Imperative that all sides do everything possible to protect civilians, restore calm
POTUS spoke to PM Netanyahu today. Conveyed our strong condemnation of terrorist rocket fire into Israel &amp; right of Israel to defend itself
@JohnKerry says it perfectly. Good diplomacy doesn’t tie one hand behind our back. Senate should confirm nat'l security nominees now.

Such an honor tonight to be asked to celebrate one of Israel’s greatest sons and a walking global treasure, my friend President Shimon Peres
No doubt future generations will wonder why anyone ever sought to criminalize love or condemn another human for being true to him or herself

The President: “Just because we have the best hammer does not mean that every problem is a nail.”

POTUS:  this new chapter in American foreign policy will allow us to redirect resources saved by ending these wars

Ugandan Anti-Homosexuality Act is an affront to universal rights and human dignity. Repeal the law.
Said it once &amp; I’ll say it again, U.S. is on the side of the Ukrainian people. Stable, prosperous, unified Ukraine in everyone’s interests
President Obama made clear, there will be costs for any military intervention in Ukraine
U.S. is deeply concerned by reports of Russian military intervention in Ukraine. Sovereignty is inviolable, as Russians like to remind.
Nobody should be discriminated against or punished for who they are or whom they love. Sad day for Uganda and the world.
U.S. trade with Mexico &amp; Canada over $3 billion/day, $1 trillion/year. More economic integration means more prosperity, good jobs

U.S. Govt has been clear and consistent that we reject efforts to boycott or delegitimize Israel
POTUS and Sec Kerry remain committed to negotiations that can secure Israeli and Palestinian futures.
John Kerry’s record of support for Israel’s security and prosperity rock solid.   
Personal attacks in Israel directed at Sec Kerry totally unfounded and unacceptable. 
Everyone rooting for Seahawks in my house! #Crushingit

We are bringing women to the fore in our efforts to prevent conflicts and forge the foundations of peace.
In the Obama Administration we have made defending women’s rights and expanding opportunities for women a centerpiece of our foreign policy
Sexual and physical violence against women is also a threat to public health, econ stability and security of nations
1/3 of women experience sexual or physical violence in their lifetimes. This is an affront to human dignity.
As I said to President’s Council on Women &amp; Girls today: rights of our daughters are just as sacred &amp; self-evident as the rights of our sons

If groups seek to gain/hold power by force, mass violence, or intimidation, US will be forced to withdraw support for #SouthSudan.  
#SouthSudan’s people voted for a peaceful, democratic, unified future.  Leaders on all sides must end violence, commit to dialogue.  
As a long-time friend of South Sudan, deeply concerned by violence that threatens to tear the new nation apart
Vital to get back toward vision set out at independence: peaceful, prosperous, inclusive democratic state. #SouthSudan

My thoughts are with the loved ones of those who lost their lives 12 years ago today.
Participated in a moment of silence this morning with @Whitehouse staff.
POTUS on #Syria: The burdens of leadership are often heavy, but the world is a better place because we have borne them.
POTUS: I will not put American boots on the ground in Syria. I will not pursue an open-ended action like Iraq or Afghanistan.
POTUS: when dictators commit atrocities, they depend upon the world to look the other way until those horrifying pictures fade from memory
POTUS on #Syria: What happened to those people...is not only a violation of international law - it's also a danger to our security
POTUS to @gwenifill: We're not talking about boots on the ground....we're talking about a very specific set of strikes.
. @HillaryClinton on #Syria: "The world will have to deal with this threat as swiftly &amp; as comprehensibly as possible."

Constructive discussion today with Senators McCain and Graham on need to hold Assad accountable for CW use against Syrian people
As Sec Kerry said, core of decision is U.S. security + preventing attacks on innocents using world’s most heinous weapons
POTUS, Administration, are in close touch with Congress, partners and allies.
Question now is how to hold Syrian govt accountable, keep Assad from using CW again.
There is no question that Assad regime used CW indiscriminately against Syrian people on Aug 21.
POTUS was delighted to welcome Presidents of Estonia, Latvia, &amp; Lithuania to the WH yesterday.
Sec. Kerry, Sec. Hagel, Dir. Clapper and I held a call earlier tonight with members of Congress to consult on the situation in #Syria

US consulting with Congress &amp; allies about how to respond to this indiscriminate use of CW.
Only regime has capacity to launch CW with rockets.
No dispute in intl community that CW used in August 21 attack. Not even Iran and Russia deny this fact.
Otherwise, we’ll all conclude that Assad is guilty and lying-again.
What is Bashar al Assad hiding? The world is demanding an independent investigation of Wednesday’s apparent CW attack. Immediately.
US strongly condemns today’s bombings in Tripoli, Lebanon and extends condolences for the loss of innocent life.
The Syrian government must allow the UN access to the attack site to investigate.  Those responsible will be held accountable.

Secretary Kerry, Special Envoy Indyk, the Israelis and Palestinians have my and the President’s full support in moving forward.
Both sides have made courageous decisions to get to this point and we are hopeful, but there is much more work to be done.

Between now and Sunday: Can I get to 300K followers before my time as @USUN Ambassador is up? #sayyes
To all my Twitter followers, Sunday is my last day as @USUN Ambassador and I want to thank you for your great interest and support.
Thanks to my fellow Ambassadors for the gracious send-off &amp; to our press corps for their reporting on important issues. I will miss you all.
I'm proud of our work to advance women's &amp; #LGBT rights, pass toughest sanctions ever on Iran &amp; DPRK, &amp; make UN more efficient &amp; effective.
We've improved relations with allies, strengthened partnerships, and exerted effective US leadership on issues that matter to #America.
Today is my last day at the @UN. Much work remains, but we've achieved a great deal over 4.5 years.
Today's #SCOTUS rulings are historic steps towards #LGBTequality. #LGBT rights are human rights, here and around the world. #DOMA #Prop8
On Intl Day for Victims of Torture let's recommit ourselves to ending torture the world over &amp; supporting its victims. Each one is too many.
Thanks to @GlobalFundWomen for their important work &amp; #writetorice campaign. Women's issues will continue to be a high priority for me.
We also honor the brave humanitarians, including #UNHCR, who risk their own safety to protect @Refugees all over the world. #WorldRefugeeDay
On #WorldRefugeeDay, we recommit ourselves to protecting the world's refugees so that they can lead lives of dignity in a lasting home.
The US condemns attack on @UNSOMALIA, a brazen assault on civilians working for peace. Our sympathies are with the victims &amp; their families.
Happy 90th birthday celebration to the great Shimon Peres. An inspiration to the people of #Israel and to us all.
Congrats to my friend @russfeingold! His experience &amp; commitment to Africa will be invaluable as he works for peace in the Great Lakes.
To #UNSG Ban Ki-moon, @UN staff, fellow PRs, and my own awesome team at @USUN, thanks for 4.5 great years.

Today's #UNSC Resolution on #Abyei augments #UNISFA. The resolution of Abyei's final status is urgent and essential.
Thank you Senator @TimKaine for your visit to @USUN and the @UN this week to see firsthand how we are working to address global challenges.
Today, on Int'l Day of @UN Peacekeepers, I'm thankful for the brave men &amp; women working to bring peace to the world's most dangerous places.
Today we honor all who served to protect our liberties, especially the wounded and fallen, and those who are serving today. Thank you all.
Encouraged by the @boyscouts decision to allow #LGBT scouts, but hope that this is just a first step to full #LGBT inclusion and equality.
With low cost interventions we can prevent &amp; treat this condition, transforming the lives of women. Learn more at http://t.co/NoKM9CQFB7.
Today is the 1st Intl Day to End Obstetric Fistula, a condition that plagues millions of women worldwide &amp; is far too forgotten. @EndFistula
All sides in #DRC must permanently end hostilities, including by disarming #M23 and ensuring accountability for human rights abusers.
Recent hostilities near #Goma between #FARDC &amp; #M23 violate 11/21 &amp; 11/24 agreements &amp; undermine efforts for a peaceful resolution in #DRC.
We are committed to @_AfricanUnion's 9/21 proposal on #Abyei and to the expansion of #UNISFA to protect civilians and enhance security.
In #UNSC consultations today on #Abyei, the US stressed that its unresolved status is fueling a cycle of violence.
I am heart-broken by yesterday's tragedy -- so many innocent lives lost, tragically including children. We are all with #Oklahoma.
Trial of Darwish is another attempt by regime to suppress freedom of expression and silence those who advocate for democracy &amp; human rights.
Deeply concerned by Assad regime's terror accusations of Mazen Darwish &amp; colleagues at the Syrian Center for Media &amp; Freedom of Expression.

RT @USUN: VIDEO: @AmbassadorRice's message on International Day Against Homophobia | http://t.co/5KjnBQYXtV #LGBT #IDAHO
On International Day Against Homophobia, we rededicate ourselves to a basic truth: human rights are universal and must be protected for all.
The US is committed to #HumanTrafficking prevention, protection, and prosecution so that we can one day achieve a world without slavery.
This week the General Assembly held an important dialogue on #HumanTrafficking -- a critical issue that deserves the attention of all of us.
This @UN resolution sends a strong message that a political solution is the best way to end suffering in #Syria.
The US strongly supports today’s #UNGA resolution on #Syria, which was just adopted by a large majority of @UN member states.
Happy Mother's Day especially to my wonderful mother, Lois Rice. A role model, inspiration, and great friend.
Happy Mother's Day to mothers all over America and the world. Being a mom is the greatest joy of my life.
We strongly condemn the brutal car bombing in #Turkey. Our condolences to the victims and their families.
Honored to receive the Distinguished Public Service award from @AJCGlobal, a group with a history of fighting for human rights &amp; democracy.
Enjoyed speaking with @Isobel_Coleman at @WomenforWomen's annual luncheon -- a terrific organization &amp; a great event. http://t.co/ASXBgydYMZ
The detention of 4 @UN peacekeepers, who were monitoring #GolanHeights-#Syria ceasefire, is unacceptable. They must be released immediately.
Special thanks to the @JointCenter for last night's award, I'm truly honored. Also incredibly humbled by @VP Biden's kind &amp; generous words.
My condolences to the family of the @MONUSCO peacekeeper killed in #DRC yesterday. The perpetrators of this attack must be held accountable.
Pleased the @UN budget committee has agreed to reforms to improve @UNPeacekeeping &amp; restore an empirical basis to troop reimbursement rates.
The perpetrators must be held accountable. We urge a quick, effective &amp; transparent investigation under the Joint Security Committee. #Abyei
Our condolences to the victims' families, the Ngok Dinka community, the people of #Ethiopia &amp; the #UN.
The US strongly condemns the outrageous attack that killed Ngok Dinka Paramount Chief Kuol Deng Kuol &amp; a UNISFA peacekeeper. #Abyei
The US fully supports #UNSC visit to #Jordan’s Syrian refugee camps. Vast majority of UNSC agrees but still a couple hold-outs.
Today, on World Press Freedom Day, we remember the brave journalists censored, persecuted, and killed for the cause of #PressFreedom. #WPFD
#UNSOM gives Somalia one door to knock on for @UN support, and will help Somalia while keeping its people and government in the lead.
Today the Security Council created a new UN political mission in Somalia, #UNSOM, putting @UN functions under one roof.
An Indian girl who was raped 2 weeks ago died yesterday, while another recovers in Delhi. They were 4 and 5 years old. Unspeakably horrible.
Proud of @jasoncollins34's courageous announcement -- a truly historic moment for the @NBA and professional sports. #rolemodel
My thoughts and prayers are with the victims of the terrible building collapse in #Bangladesh, including the many still trapped inside.
On #WorldMalariaDay, let's reflect on #Malaria's tragic toll but also remember that we can do more to prevent it. Let’s #endmalaria.
Mosquito nets are key to preventing deaths, but we must invest in innovation and research to eradicate #malaria. #WorldMalariaDay
#Malaria infects over 200m people each year and kills over 600k. Saddest statistic? It kills one child every minute. #WorldMalariaDay
We urge transitional authorities in #Mali to hold to their commitment of legitimate elections by July or as soon as is technically feasible.
Also key that #MINUSMA’s mandate is subject to review in 60 days to ensure that security situation in #Mali is conducive to deployment.
In creating @UNPeacekeeping force in #Mali, the @UN Security Council reaffirmed its call for a dual-track political &amp; security approach.
Outraged by Richard Falk's highly offensive Boston comments. Someone who spews such vitriol has no place at the UN. Past time for him to go.
We owe it to ourselves to protect the environment. It is also the least we can do for our children and grandchildren. #HappyEarthDay
Over 35,000 IDPs need urgent assistance in East #Darfur alone. Immediate humanitarian access is imperative.
In 2013, clashes displaced nearly 150,000 in #Darfur: 5 times more than in all of 2012.
Security is deteriorating across #Darfur. In last 12 months, 7 peacekeepers were killed.
We condemn yesterday's attack on #UNAMID in East #Darfur. Our condolences to the friends, family &amp; colleagues of the fallen peacekeeper.

Brazilian troops have an excellent @UNPeacekeeping record. I have seen what a big difference they have made in #Haiti.
Brazil's @UNPeacekeeping training center preps military &amp; civilians from #Brazil &amp; other countries. Impressed by high quality of training.
Brazil has made important progress but still faces real challenges, especially violence against #LGBT persons.
Had an informative meeting with Brazilian #LGBT activists today.
Thanks to Coach Alex Mathias, Chicago's Hudson Fortune and @Nike for making this club possible. Girls sports turbocharge women's leadership.

Congratulations on 5 successful years, Andrea! I’ve enjoyed all of my opportunities to be a guest on @MitchellReports. #AMR5years
Under the #ArmsTradeTreaty nations will put in place controls that reduce the risk of arms transfers being used to commit the worst crimes.

Ansar al-Dine, AQIM &amp; other extremists pose a grave threat to the people of Mali &amp; the region, &amp; we are working to eliminate that threat.
The #UNSC has placed Ansar al-Dine on its al-Qaeda sanctions list, an important step to deny them access to the global financial system.
The creation of the COI in #DPRK is also a major step in focusing the spotlight on one of the world's most secretive &amp; abusive regimes.
Also, the new Commission of Inquiry on #DPRK #Humanrights demonstrates the world's unity in its concern over deteriorating conditions there.
Now is the time for follow-through on the promises by #SriLanka. The backsliding on rule of law &amp; human rights protections must be reversed.
Today the Human Rights Council was clear: #SriLanka must fulfill obligations to its people to take concrete steps on truth &amp; reconciliation.

An Afghan-led reconciliation process is important for stability, which in turn is the best way to bring lasting peace to the region.

It was an incredible honor to share the stage with my mom, Lois Rice, and receive the ASACC National Service Award today.
Success at #CSW57 - a tribute to two great women leaders. Thank you @Bacheletjeria we will miss you! Marjon Kamara, we love and salute you!
More work remains but #CSW57 conclusions are a significant step toward ensuring all women live productive lives free of violence; abuse.
We fought hard for #LGBT rights at #CSW57. #SouthAfrica rocked by our side to the end. Not right that basic rights should be so hard.
Importantly, the #CSW57 conclusions clearly acknowledge the importance of protecting sexual &amp; reproductive health &amp; reproductive rights.
I commend the work of the Commission on the Status of Women, and applaud its participants for their tireless work for #women. #CSW57
US has provided over $385m in aid, but #Syria needs the rest of the world's help. @UNOCHA report: http://t.co/uCqBX0Gpgj
Donors pledged $1.5b in aid to Syria in 2013, but only $300m delivered. Hard for @UNOCHA to meet 100% of need with only 20% of funds.
Bachelet has been a tenacious and inspirational leader and a role model for women everywhere. I wish her all the best in her next chapter.
Major bummer Michelle Bachelet is leaving @UN_Women. She is awesome and helped save #CSW 2013.

Sudan should sit down with #SPLMN to negotiate an immediate ceasefire in #SouthernKordofan &amp; #BlueNile and uphold its commitments on #Abyei.
The agreements need to be implemented promptly &amp; fully and the dire humanitarian situation in the #TwoAreas &amp; the status of #Abyei resolved.

Congrats to my friend John Brennan on his confirmation as CIA Director today. I look forward to continuing to work with him in his new role.
We regret that North Korea has again chosen the path of provocation, instead of path of peace. It’s time for North Korea to change course.
The strength, breadth &amp; severity of the #DPRK sanctions will make it much more difficult for them to pursue their WMD &amp; missile programs.
The new #UN resolution increases #NorthKorea isolation and raises the cost to their leaders for defying the international community.
Many thanks Valerie! @vj44 MT @USUN: Valerie Jarrett speaking on intimate partner violence at US #CSW57 event today. http://t.co/3ynRwCU9F1
We demand the immediate, unconditional release of #UNDOF peacekeepers. All UN personnel must be allowed to operate freely and in safety.
Today the Security Council condemned the detention of more than 20 #UNDOF peacekeepers by armed elements of the Syrian opposition.
We can't forget that the victims are our own mothers, our daughters, our sisters, and maybe even ourselves. #CSW57
We need more than plans and laws to fight #violenceagainstwomen. We need implementation, accountability and enforcement. #CSW57
I just spoke at #CSW57. All women and girls have a right to live free from violence and fear. We've made good progress, but have more to do.
We stand with the Government &amp; people of #Somalia as they maintain their recent progress &amp; turn the page on decades of civil war.
Today, the #UNSC signaled clear support for #Somalia, unifying UN development &amp; relief work &amp; suspending the 20 year old arms embargo.
If adopted, the sanctions would break new ground on impeding #NorthKorea nuclear &amp; ballistic missile programs &amp; proliferation activities
The #NorthKorea sanctions resolution introduced today represents credible &amp; strong consequences for continued #DPRK provocations
Honored to lead the US delegation to the 57th Commission on the Status of Women, which kicks off today. #CSW57

#UNSC must now decide to back #AU’s call for end to #Sudan’s obstruction or become complicit in worsening humanitarian &amp; security situation.
#Sudan clearly bears the preponderance of responsibility for the impasse in implementing the Sept. 27 agreements &amp; #TwoAreas talks.
Recent escalation in border tensions--including SAF bombings--could easily lead to larger-scale confrontation between #Sudan &amp; #SouthSudan.

Ongoing bombardments by the government of #Sudan are killing innocents &amp; leaving many thousands beyond the reach of desperately needed aid.
Gravely concerned by @hrw's report that #Sudan is killing civilians with improvised barrel bombs filled with nails &amp; jagged metal.
Security Council must work concertedly to deliver a clear message to Pyongyang: violating #UNSC resolutions has consequences.
#UNSC condemned yesterday's missile launch, no matter how North Korea chooses to characterize it, as a violation of two UNSC resolutions.

Our thoughts are with the four #UN personnel who were wounded today in #Syria. We stand by the men &amp; women of #UNDOF.
We urge the parties to resume direct talks on all the issues that still divide them, without preconditions.
Long after the votes have been cast &amp; speeches forgotten, it's the Palestinians &amp; Israelis who must still talk - and listen - to each other.
Progress towards a just &amp; lasting two-state solution cannot be made by pressing a green voting button in NY.
Today's unfortunate &amp; counterproductive resolution places further obstacles in the path to peace. The U.S. therefore voted against it.
*No daughter* deserves to be mutilated. Emerging global consensus won’t be silent until #FGM has finally come to an end.
This matters. MT @AP Campaigners against #FGM score victory with #UN panel's approval of resolution on global ban: http://t.co/qFXdnYOV
As Pres. Obama has said, hope cannot be imprisoned &amp; aspirations cannot be killed. But we must continue to speak for those who are silenced.
Importantly, the world demanded the release of members of the @SyrianCenter, who are being persecuted simply for standing up for Syrians.
And by a larger margin than last year, the #UNGA condemned #Syria's all-out assault against the rights &amp; freedoms of Syrians.
The #UNGA condemned #NorthKorea's brutal record by consensus for the first time ever. Didn’t even need to vote.
The world spoke out against #Iran's thuggish campaign against its people, highlighting its record of torture &amp; pervasive harassment.
Today in New York, the world again came together to spotlight &amp; condemn the atrocious #HumanRights records of #Iran, #Syria &amp; #NorthKorea.
As the President said last week, something is happening in #Burma that cannot be reversed &amp; the US supports Burma in this process of reform.
After decades of repression, today there is building momentum for reform and progress on human rights in #Burma.
Today, every nation of the world recognized the progress #Burma has made on human rights &amp; laid out how it can be sustained &amp; deepened.
We should never approach this deplorable milestone again. Let us work together to ensure we don’t. #pressfreedom
More journalists have been killed in 2012 than in any year since @UNESCO began keeping track.

Resolution 2076 reinforces the intense diplomatic efforts toward our shared goal of ending the rebellion in Eastern DRC.

We will not allow the remarkable progress the #UN has made on #LGBT issues in the last four years to be rolled back.
Fitting, on National #Transgender Day of Remembrance, that #UNGA acknowledges protections on the basis of gender identity.
Good to see #UNGA reject removal of "sexual orientation &amp; gender identity" from resolution on extrajudicial, summary, &amp; arbitrary executions
Justice, human rights and freedom from fear of arbitrary violence apply to all individuals regardless of who they are or whom they love.
Appalled by efforts to strip the reference to “sexual orientation and gender identity” from the UN's resolution on extrajudicial killing.
The #UNSC should urgently consider sanctions against more M23 commanders. We are reviewing the possibility of more U.S. sanctions as well.
We support #DRC efforts to repel the M23's offensive and secure towns under threat, and commend #MONUSCO &amp; #FARDC resolve to secure Goma.
Appalled by renewal of M23’s military campaign in #DRC. The violence must end now. M23 leaders must be held accountable for their atrocities
Having completed its transition, including a new provisional constitution, parliament &amp; president, #Somalia must do its part as well #Piracy
Effectively countering #piracy requires action on multiple fronts, including apprehending the criminals who lead, manage, &amp; finance it.
Today's #UNSC debate on #piracy highlights that while the number of pirate attacks is dropping rapidly, even one hostage is too many.
Parliament's swift &amp; decisive cabinet endorsement shows us what collaboration, good faith and hard work can do. #Somalia
Hopeful sign of a new era in #Somalia: new 10-person cabinet includes *two* women, including the Foreign Minister.
These new sanctions send an important message to other perpetrators of atrocities in #DRC: accountability.
New U.S. and #UN sanctions on Sultani Makenga show the world will not stand for heinous atrocities committed on his orders by the #M23. #DRC
Happy Diwali to our friends who are celebrating this auspicious holiday. We wish you warmth, happiness &amp; prosperity.
Far more to do, but today’s vote reaffirms our determination to deliver real results. #HumanRights

Very pleased to join the Social Good Summit on 9/23 for a chat w @Mashable. We'll talk #UNGA, tech tools &amp; public service. #SGSglobal
In the United States of America, we draw strength from our differences. Happy 1st Anniversary on the repeal of 'Don't Ask Don't Tell.' #DADT
Total lack of progress in addressing the humanitarian crisis in S. #Kordofan and #BlueNile is unacceptable.
Presidents of #Sudan &amp; #SouthSudan are scheduled to meet on 9/23 - must lead to lasting agreements on outstanding issues.
We've repeatedly laid out clear proposals to address #Iran's nuclear issue, step by step. The onus is on Iran to respond constructively.
#Iran's arms exports to #Syria’s murderous Assad regime—now the central party to its illicit transfers—are a particular concern.
#Iran knows the steps it needs to take to meet its international obligations. Yet it continues to try to deny, deceive &amp; distract.
Fond farewell to an outstanding @PeaceCorps director, my friend, Aaron Williams. Wishing you the best in your future endeavors.
#Mali's crises need an integrated &amp; coordinated approach from the international community- and hard work to head off protracted displacement
#Mali's fragmentation has further entrenched hard-line elements &amp; led to a humanitarian crisis affecting 500K. Threat is urgent &amp; immediate.

Wishing all who celebrate Rosh Hashanah a sweet new year filled with blessings and happiness. Shana tova u'metuka.
The Council also called on nations to live up to a fundamental international obligation: protect diplomats &amp; diplomatic property.
Today, the #UN Security Council spoke as one, and it was strong &amp; clear: attacks against diplomats are utterly unjustifiable.
They were fathers, brothers and beloved sons. May God bless their memories.
Nothing we do can bring back these remarkable Americans. Nothing we say will bring true comfort to their dear families.
Today, Ambassador Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty have come home to be laid to rest.
Glen Doherty - "Bub" - thank you for your service. Our hearts are with your family - Bernard, Barbara, Gregory &amp; Kathleen.
Tyrone S. Woods - "Rone" - we thank you for your 2 decades in uniform. Our hearts are with your wife, Dorothy, and your three sons.
We know you dream of a strong, united #Libya. Ambassador Stevens shared your dream. The best way to honor him is to make it real.
Thank you to our Libyan friends for your kind messages yesterday about Ambassador Stevens. I appreciate all of them.
On this day of profound grief, we honor, as ever, the service and sacrifice of our American diplomatic family.
I join President Obama and Secretary Clinton in condemning this vicious and senseless attack on Americans.
I was fortunate to work with Amb. Stevens. He represented the very best of America and he was a close friend of the Libyan people.
I am profoundly saddened by the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi, #Libya, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens.
To our servicemen &amp; servicewomen and to our veterans: THANK YOU. http://t.co/StIsvuHA

Today we pledge to never condone terrorism; never make excuses for it; never keep company with those who sow hatred; and never forget.
The killers targeted Americans of every creed &amp; faith and citizens of 90 countries from every corner of this Earth that we share.
Today, we remember the victims and their families. #Remember911
We thank the #AU, #UN &amp; regional stakeholders for helping Somalis make this day possible. Yes, still more to do. #Somalia
Congratulations to Pres. Hassan &amp; the Somali people. Now comes the opportunity you have sought: to build a more stable, peaceful future.
The United States stands with all those in #Iran who remain imprisoned simply because of their faith.
For 3 years, Pastor Nadarkhani faced a death sentence in #Iran, a clear violation of his human rights. Today he is finally free.
Powerful sanctions expose &amp; isolate the Haqqanis and further erode their ability to carry out terrorist attacks.
Today, the United States has designated the #Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.
Given the growing severity of this humanitarian crisis, a business-as-usual approach from Khartoum is intolerable.
#Sudan has a responsibility to care for its own people, and it should do so with the urgency that this emergency situation requires.
We hoped an agreement on humanitarian access to #Sudan's Two Areas would result in help for hundreds of thousands in need. It hasn't.
We're grateful to those who’ve opened their borders &amp; call on all who are concerned for the safety of Syrians to help w/safe passage.
We are now giving over $100M in humanitarian relief to those beset by conflict in #Syria. Details here: http://t.co/V03vG3HD
100,000+: the number of people driven from #Syria in August by vicious, unrelenting violence.
The people of #Colombia deserve lasting peace &amp; security. Pres. Santos's efforts hold great promise that they will be able to enjoy both.
Palpable sorrow felt here in Addis Ababa. We extend our condolences &amp; best wishes to the Ethiopian people.
Meles leaves an indelible legacy for the people of #Ethiopia, from opposition to extremism to support for the poor.
I am honored to represent the United States at the funeral of late PM Meles Zenawi of #Ethiopia.

Two years ago tonight, President Obama announced the end of the American combat operation in #Iraq.
#Syria's people fully understand which countries have rallied to their cause and which have protected a doomed &amp; desperate Assad.
The question is not whether the #Syria regime will fall; the question is when, and at what price.
But - #Syria's crisis is not, at root, a humanitarian crisis. It is a political crisis caused by the regime's cruelty &amp; callousness.
Our aid has fed the hungry and bound up the wounds of as many of Assad's victims as we can reach.
My government is pursuing every avenue to provide humanitarian relief to those affected by the violence in #Syria - $82m already this year.
Bashar al-Assad and those who still stand by him are now responsible for the deaths of more than 20,000 in #Syria.

#Syria regime says the opposition is responsible for the massacre in #Houla. Another blatant lie.
No progress from #Sudan on allowing open humanitarian access.
S. #Kordofan &amp; Blue Nile situation remains extremely dire. Skyrocketing numbers of children suffering from acute malnutrition.
Absolutely clear that #Sudan and #SouthSudan forces remain in close proximity on the border, seemingly on a hair trigger.
Still important for #Sudan to withdraw all of its police elements from #Abyei.
#UNSC heard confirmation this morning that #SouthSudan forces &amp; #Sudan's SAF forces have pulled out of #Abyei. Progress.
Time we talk about #Syria options in stark terms. To let this become a proxy war would be to basically concede a violent regional wildfire.
Third &amp; worst: violence intensifies, spills over, exploits sectarian fissures. #UNSC unity gone. Annan plan gone. Most probable now.
Second possible outcome - Russia/China need to agree - #UNSC &amp; international community assume responsibilities, exert pressure on Asad.
First &amp; best: #Syria wakes up, stops killing, adheres to its obligations under multiple #UNSC resolutions. Not a high probability.
Three scenarios could materialize in #Syria. They are mutually exclusive.
Charles Taylor deserves to spend the rest of his life in prison. Today's sentencing means that he likely will.

Unacceptable levels of violence &amp; abuse are continuing. While use of heavy weapons has declined, other forms of violence have increased.

The conviction of Charles Taylor sends a clear message to all perpetrators of atrocities: you can & will be held accountable.
We look forward to the #UNSG's comprehensive survey of the issue in 6 months. #UNSC needs a birds-eye view of #UN efforts.
Tendency to view these items in isolation of their common feature: vulnerabilities at poorly secured borders.
Illicit flows - of arms, drugs, weapons materials, terrorists/funds, conflict minerals, even human beings - expose one of those weak links.
In our interconnected world, our system of collective security is only as strong as the weakest links in the chain.

But we need to get the beginnings of a critical mass of observers on the ground. Need to test if they can have an impact worth maintaining.
Our patience is exhausted. Continuation of bloodshed is not only unacceptable but reprehensible. #Syria
Annan emphasized that "the only promises that count are the promises that are kept." #Syria
Today in the #UNSC, JSE Kofi Annan said the situation in #Syria "continues to be unacceptable."

No one should assume that U.S. will agree to renew this #Syria mission at the end of 90 days if Syrian regime has not met its commitments.
Deployment of 300 or even 3000 unarmed observers cannot, on its own, stop Asad's murderous rampage; only external pressure on regime can.

On Yom HaShoah, I join President Obama in honoring the memory of six million who were murdered simply because they were Jewish.
We believe we have a moral responsibility to lead towards a world without nuclear weapons. Today's #UNSC PRST is a milestone on that path.
Today the #UNSC spoke together in strong support for nuclear safety, nonproliferation & disarmament efforts since 2009.
#Syria's government could easily do all of these things today.
Government must pull back its troops and heavy weapons from the population centers - immediately.
Shelling of Homs and other cities must end - immediately.
#Syria monitors must be able to go to vulnerable cities like Homs. Today.
Since UNSCR 2042, #Syria has unleashed another wave of horrific violence & restricted the movement of the few monitors on the ground.
U.S. agrees with #UNSG Ban Ki-moon that the cessation of armed violence in #Syria is incomplete - to say the least.
Monitors won't by themselves sustain a #Syria ceasefire. Onus is on the Syrian government to stop the bloodshed.
#UNSC is clear: #Syria advance monitors must be able to operate & move freely. Concern on both counts that conditions aren't there.
Syrian regime lied to the world, lied to its people & the biggest fabricator is Asad himself. Words are meaningless.Actions are what matter.
In #Syria, the violence is continuing. The bombardment, particularly in Homs and Idlib, is increasing.
Today, the #UNSC discussed ways to leverage its influence, including sanctions. #Sudan #SouthSudan
Too many issues in the CPA remain unresolved. Both #Sudan & #SouthSudan have been taking actions to provoke and undermine each other.

We are under no illusions. New reports of shelling, arrests, deaths. This has gone on way too long.
Resolution 2042 on #Syria is an impt step for the #UNSC towards fulfilling its responsibilities. It is about time.
By a 15-0 vote, the #UNSC has just shown that it will judge the regime in #Syria by its actions, not its words.

Last night at the #UN, I lit one of five candles memorializing those who were murdered in the #Rwanda genocide. http://t.co/1RS7J9nQ
But the onus remains on the government of #Syria. Its track record up until today has been dismal.
Critical: #Syria must create enabling environment for a Syrian-led political transition in which Syrians' aspirations are met.
As we all know, Annan plan also includes freedom of association, freedom of movement for journalists & humanitarian actors. #Syria
If fragile, initial opening is sustained; forces/heavy weapons pulled back & returned to barracks; then maybe start of new way fwd. #Syria
Annan stressed in particular that #Syria gov troops & heavy weapons remain in population centers. They need to be pulled back.
But Joint Special Envoy Annan was clear: what #Syria has done today does not constitute full compliance.
Today we saw, for the first time in a long time in #Syria, a brief, positive step, which we hope will be sustained.
Time now for the fighting to stop and for both sides to get back to the negotiating table. #Sudan #SouthSudan
#SouthSudan confirms it's seized Heglig. Very serious. SPLA must withdraw and #Sudan must stop bombardments & incursions into South Sudan.
#UNSC was just briefed on the volatile situation at the border between #Sudan and #SouthSudan.
The burden remains squarely on the #Syria regime to meet its obligations in full. Actions, not words.
What #Syria committed to in its letter today is not--and cannot--be construed as compliance with the Annan peace plan.
To the people of #CotedIvoire: we are with you as you deal with the challenges of your past & pave a way to a better future. #civ2010

At the #UNSC, young people have the greatest stake in the work we do. Half the world’s population is under 25.
If this continues, the #UNSC will have to determine whether it is prepared for the logical next step: unified action. #Syria
It is outrageous, but by no means surprising, that the government of #Syria has yet again made commitments & broken them.
After all this time & bloodshed--after all the commitments made & promises broken--we are facing a moment of truth. #Syria
If #Syria refuses to implement Annan's plan despite its commitments, then Russia/China have to be prepared to follow their words w/actions.
Instead of meeting its commitments, #Syria has escalated the violence & stepped up its use of heavy weapons.

As Pres. #Obama said, Resolution 1973 showed "how the international community is supposed to work..." #Libya
One year ago today, the #UNSC adopted Resolution 1973 on #Libya. I have never been more proud to cast a vote.
I share George Clooney's outrage at continued bombings, missile attacks &amp; impending famine in Southern Kordofan. It must stop.
I am grateful for George Clooney's attention to #Sudan. Had a good meeting with him this week. http://t.co/r9AMesjI
Proud of the U.S. delegation, which worked hard to pass a strong resolution on #maternalmortality. #CSW56
I'm disappointed that #CSW56 failed to support the reproductive rights of rural women.
It is an honor to help welcome our British friends and colleagues to the United States today.
The U.S.-UK alliance is essential to the UN and critical to security &amp; prosperity around the world.
Pres #Obama: "Through the grand sweep of history...there is one constant: the rock-solid alliance between the U.S. &amp; the UK."
Only one reason why #Syria would plant antipersonnel landmines at its borders: to murder civilians trying to escape it. Truly horrific.
The people of the region have taken great risks. It remains their work - with international support - to create change that lasts.
As #SecClinton said today, building prosperous, democratic socieities is a "continuous commitment" - one we all share.
As we mark a year of extraordinary change in the #MiddleEast &amp; North Africa, we are mindful of choices &amp; consequences that lie ahead.
You are our friend and partner, and you have our enduring support as you continue to recover. #oneyearlater
To the Japanese people: I join all Americans in honoring your bravery in the face of unimaginable loss. #oneyearlater

A particular shout-out today to the brave women of #Libya, who were so impressive during my November visit. #IWD
Proud of all the strong women who stand up as examples for our sons & daughters. Happy International Women's Day.
Good #UN has a plan for added focus on #humanrights, so principles central to the revolution can lay a solid foundation for #Libya's future.
Building a strong, open society in #Libya is an arduous task. But even amid ongoing threats, it can be accomplished, step by step.
#Libya PM El-Keib's visit to the #UN Security Council was most welcome today.
Nobody should face discrimination, violence or death because of who they are or whom they love.
Today, 76 countries criminalize consensual same-sex relationships. For the sake of our #humanrights, it is time to get that number to 0.
Today's report of the #UN #humanrights commissioner shows us what #LGBT individuals still face in far too many nations. http://t.co/QzVC3KyU
We remain deeply concerned about the grave situation in S.Kordofan & Blue Nile. A famine is looming w/out an infusion of life-saving aid.
Conflict between #Sudan & #SouthSudan will damage the interests of both sides and erode fragile progress in the South.
The #UNSC is finally over its long paralysis on #Sudan. Impt statement today demands halt to violence & action on range of critical issues.
Don Payne was our moral compass. I admired him tremendously and will miss him.

When it comes to preventing #Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, Pres. Obama takes no options off the table. He means what he says.
There should be no doubt: President Obama has #Israel's back.
Underscores the urgency of #Sudan's giving immediate, unconditional humanitarian access to S. Kordofan & Blue Nile.
Grateful for @AnnCurry's reporting on the struggle of the Nuban people to survive in #Sudan. http://t.co/WAyBOdKv
The #UNSC expressed its deep disappointment that #Syria denied @ValerieAmos entry, as promised. And it deplored the humanitarian situation.
Minutes ago, the #UNSC called in one voice for #Syria to allow full, unimpeded humanitarian access - now.
We can't leave half of any country's rich human potential untapped. #CSW56
The Asad regime's callous disregard for the needs of #Syria's people is not surprising, but it is reprehensible.
Food shortages in Homs are reported to be so severe that people, esp children, will soon start dying of hunger. #Syria
Shameful that Asad has denied access to #UN's @ValerieAmos while humanitarian situation is desperate & regime prepares final assault on Homs
Valerie Jarrett is up from the @WhiteHouse- will lead a panel discussion on ways to strengthen women's political participation. #CSW56

Larger issue: the world agrees Assad must go and is taking steps to up the pressure, help foster a unified opp & open up humanitarian space.

Heartbroken by the loss of the NYT's Anthony Shadid in Syria. One of the world's bravest and best journalists.
The only question now is how many more women, men & children will suffer or be killed by Asad before that transition begins.
A rapid transition to democracy in #Syria has garnered the resounding support of the international community. Change must now come.

At least two #ArabLeague monitors were roughed up today. #ArabLeague has released a statement blaming pro-regime elements.

The world is starting to match its disapproval of #Syria's crackdown w/concrete steps to bring it to an end. Past time for #UNSC to do same.
With more than 5000 now dead, the number of murdered in #Syria has at least doubled since #Pillay's last briefing to the #UNSC in August.
The United States welcomes today's briefing by the #UN High Commissioner for #HumanRights on the appalling human rights crisis in #Syria.
Pres. #Obama pledged to end the #Iraq War, focus our fight on al Qaeda, & restore our standing in the world. That's what we have done.
The #Iraq War is over & our troops are coming home. Iraqis now have the chance to secure their own country & build their own future.
We will ALWAYS support humanity’s march forward. #HumanRights are not conferred, but rather reside w/in the soul of every human being.
Too many innocents are consigned by traffickers to terrifying lives of bonded labor. #EndSlavery #HumanRights
Too many endure discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, tearing at our common humanity. #LGBT #HumanRights
Activists & journalists, examples of our deep longing to assemble & speak the truth, still face kidnapping, torture, or murder. #HumanRights
We were also reminded that justice in the struggle for #humanrights does not come easily. #Syria
In #SouthSudan, a people won responsibility for their own future. #2011 #HumanRights
Threats & abuses in #Libya drew resistance from the country’s brave citizens & isolation abroad. #2011 #HumanRights
In #2011, shouts for freedom in #Tunisia & #Egypt reverberated throughout the region & inspired every corner of the globe. #HumanRights
#2011 will be remembered as a touchstone in humanity’s long struggle for dignity. #HumanRightsDay
Asad: Denials won't work. The world is watching. #YouTube #Homs
I am deeply concerned about reports that #Syria's forces are preparing a large-scale assault on #Homs.
We strongly condemn today's roadside bomb attack against #UN peacekeepers in #Lebanon & reaffirm our strong support for UNIFIL.
Iranian gov's attempt to block Virtual Embassy Tehran says it all about its trust in its own citizens & odds of success in the 21st century.
Asad's claim that he knows nothing about the killing of his ppl is offensive to #Syria's victims & families. His days in power are numbered.

Gave major speech in Kigali. Big shout out to impressive economic and social progress made since genocide.
Today's long overdue agreement is a strong step for #Yemen's people. We urge the parties to implement it in good faith & w/full transparency
#Libya & #Rwanda twitterers: thanks for your interest during my trip this week. I hope we can keep the conversation going.
Having failed in #Rwanda & #Darfur, the #UN Security Council did not fail again in #Libya.
Many of us heard strong echoes of 1994 when Qadhafi promised that he would root out the people of Benghazi like "rats." #Libya #Rwanda
#Rwanda is the only country in the world to this day where the majority in parliament are women (45 of 80 seats).
#Rwanda: Having endured the worst, you nonetheless aspired to be the best.
Just delivered a speech in Kigali on #Rwanda's remarkable progress & potential.
These brave engineers kept #Benghazi- & the revolution- connected to each other & the rest of the world & foiled the paranoid regime. #Libya
In the battle for a new #Libya, there were many fighters on many different front lines, like the engineers I met at the Benghazi Data Center
Mo is missed by many, especially #Libya's people & its press. @acarvin
Met the family of Mohammed "Mo" Nabbous, a Libyan hero killed by Qadhafi's murderous men on 3/19 while reporting for his brave new channel.
#Libyan #women kick butt. It's clear the new govt needs to fulfill its commitment to include them at the highest levels of govt & society.
Also met w/women leaders (org by @mercycorps) who are ready to match their contributions to the revolution w/full participation in democracy
Members of the #Benghazi 17 February Media Center are demonstrating the power of a vibrant civil society in a free #Libya.
At the Media Ctr, saw political cartoons that were incisive, biting, humorous, poignant. #Libya's artists are ready for their new democracy.
I began my visit there w/a healthy dose of Revolutionary Rap. Hip hop is alive & well in #Libya & motivating young & not-so-young alike!
Met Dr. Atef al-Hasia, founder of the 17 February Media Ctr in #Benghazi. Had a good discussion w/journalists & bloggers in the new #Libya.
Bubaker Habib guided me thru my visit to #Benghazi. He's the brave Libyan who aided the @USAirForce pilot who ejected over eastern #Libya.
Many retold memories of watching #UNSC vote on a mega-screen- every detail, like how I held my arm up, looked around to ensure no surprises!
A living monument to the strength, courage & hope of the #Libyan people. Awe-inspiring - flags, posters, pictures, monuments, songs & cheers
#Benghazi's #FreedomSquare: the moment I stepped in, I was lifted by handshakes, hugs, kisses, & exuberance at #Libya's newfound freedom.
Today's resolution is the first ever on #humanrights abuses in #Syria, & enjoys co-sponsorship from key Arab partners.
Shortly, the #UNGA will speak up for the people of #Syria, whose govt has gone to horrific lengths to silence their dissent.

Good morning from #Benghazi. Eight months ago, I never expected I would be able to see this place.
And establish a new political system predicated on democratic principles & respect for human rights. #Libya
We expect the new govt will make every effort to consolidate militias, secure weapons, care for #Libya's wounded warriors...
Today I congratulated new #Libya PM Abdul Raheem al-Keeb of the TNC & the Libyan people for wresting control of their future from a dictator
While there, I met with former prisoners as well as families of the missing, dead. Courage, determination to tell story in face of true evil
The stench of death & cruelty was pervasive - warehouse converted into a prison and torture room. In the end, a killing zone.
This morning I visited the site of an atrocity committeed by the Qadhafi regime as it was collapsing. Horrific legacy of a tyrant. #Libya
It was moving to see the raising of the flag of a free #Libya at the #UN in Sept. But nothing like seeing the tricolor on Libyan ground.
8 months after the #UNSC came to the defense of the Libyan people, I've come to witness progress & lend support to Libyan & #UN personnel.
It is good to be in #Libya.
More than 100 countries supported the resolution. #Iran and 8 others opposed. Not one of the 8 was predominantly Arab. Not one.
Overwhelming passage of #UNGA resolution sends a clear message to #Iran: attacks on diplomats are intolerable.

Today's reinstatement of #Libya to the #UN #HRC is an achievement for the Council & the start of a new opportunity for the Libyan people.
#IAEA report & vote today are unequivocal: #Iran is not living up to its internat'l obligations. We will keep the pressure on until it does.
Pres. #Obama's statement after his important discussion w/Aung San Suu Kyi indeed indicates "flickers of progress" in #Burma.
Last night, Pres. #Obama made clear that our goal is a #Burma that is responsive to the will & needs of its people.

#UNSC meeting on one of the world's most brutal orgs. #LRA's continuing activity is an affront to human dignity & a stain on our conscience.
Today the Arab League came to the defense of the Syrian people. Suspending #Syria & setting the table for sanctions are bold steps.
Just started following @CrisisTracker. Part of @Invisible's early warning network on #LRA violence in remote communities. Very impressive.
#UNSC will be examining ways we can prevail upon the parties to de-escalate & resolve critical issues that can only be done thru talks.
And the South needs to have the wisdom and the restraint not to take the bait and not to respond in kind.
The Government of Sudan needs to halt all offensive actions against the South. Immediately.
The fact that the representative of the Govt of #Sudan has come to the #UNSC & blatantly lied about them is disturbing to the United States.

On behalf of the United States of America: a warm welcome to the Republic of South Sudan, the UN's 193rd member state.
The United States wholeheartedly supports #SouthSudan’s application for membership. Eagerly await formal GA vote tomorrow.
This morning, the UN SecCouncil recommended the admission of the Republic of #SouthSudan into the United Nations.
Such abuses don't just tear at our hearts. They rip the fabric of our societies and undermine our shared security.
The UN SecCouncil just passed a measure giving the SecGen a mandate to name & shame those who attack schools & hospitals.
The United States remains focused on the urgency of resolving remaining core issues, including Abyei's status.

Gov of Sudan can prevent crisis from escalating further. Security should be agreed upon through negotiations - not dictated by use of force.

We have lost far too many journalists in recent weeks. On World Press Freedom Day, we honor their memory. http://goo.gl/hrVNa #WPFD
This afternoon, the Security Council passed a statement welcoming the news that #UBL will never again perpetrate acts of terrorism.
I am bursting with pride in our brilliant special forces, intelligence experts, our President and all who brought UBL to justice!
New HRC resolution mandates a mission to investigate human rights violations in Syria and strikes a blow against its cynical HRC candidacy

UN ambassador from #Syria lamely attempts to whitewash regime crackdown. Totally divorced from reality.
Casting blame on outsiders instead of addressing internal failures no way for a government to respond to legitimate calls for reform. #Syria
Brutal acts against protesters are neither those of a responsible government nor of a credible member of the international community. #Syria
An important Human Rights Council special session on the dire human rights situation in #Syria will take place on Friday.
Just spoke at a UN Security Council briefing on the situation in #Syria
President Assad is disingenuously blaming outsiders - at the same time seeking Iranian assistance to repress citizens. #Syria
The abhorrent use of violence to quell protests must come to an end, and now. #Syria.
At the #UN Security Council, just discussed outrageous attacks on demonstrators by the government of #Syria.
Arab League is right: demonstrators in Syria and elsewhere "deserve support, not bullets" http://goo.gl/vmsjc
And we strongly support Ban Ki-moon's call for a constructive response from #SriLanka authorities on the UN report.
UN report on #SriLanka makes an extensive, important contribution to justice, accountability and reconciliation. We commend SYG for release.

Yesterday, Security Council discussed #Yemen. Political process needs to result in a swift and credible transition – not violence.
There is no justifying the recruitment of child soldiers. There is no tolerable number of child soldiers.
I am deeply dismayed by reports that children are being recruited to kill in #Libya.
Joe will lead a team that has been energetically pushing for serious, sustained, and comprehensive reform at the UN.
I am delighted to welcome Joseph M. Torsella, our new U.S. Ambassador for UN reform. Very much look forward to working with Joe.

Tough work lies ahead to rebuild #CotedIvoire. Impact of crisis on Ivorian lives, livelihoods has been staggering and will still be felt.
Important that women are at the negotiating table and play a crucial role in promoting peace and security.
Today in the Security Council, I thanked Michelle @Bachelet of @UN_Women for her work.
WH statement: Escalating repression by the Syrian government is outrageous http://goo.gl/ZTxoB
Violence against women remains endemic. In Security Council, discussing how women can be better represented in negotiating peace.
Alongside rebuilding efforts in #CotedIvoire, human rights abuses must be investigated, perpetrators held accountable
#Gbagbo’s illegitimate claim to power is over. People of #CotedIvoire deserve peace, democracy, and gov that respects human rights.

Small investment in UN buys us efforts to keep peace, fight poverty, halt spread of nuclear, deliver aid. Worth it.
Pres #Obama: “Former President Gbagbo must stand down immediately, and direct those who are fighting on his behalf to lay down their arms.”
The loss of humanitarians and peacekeepers in today's plane crash is a tragedy for the UN, for the DRC, and for all who wish for peace.

Sanctions on Gbagbo and his circle are a strong signal: Ivorians should have the opportunity to make their country peaceful and whole.
And that he was "appointed" by a foreign minister who is no longer the foreign minister. #musakusa #Libya
I find it intriguing that the former Foreign Minister of Nicaragua is seeking to become the permanent representative of #Libya at the UN.

This is another clear warning to #Qadhafi and those who still stand by him: they must stop the killing. He must go, and he must go now.
For the first time ever, the UN General Assembly has suspended an HRC member. #Libya’s leaders brought this upon themselves.
All 192 member states just agreed to suspend #Libya from Human Rights Council. Unprecedented.
On @todayshow, reaffirmed US is not in the business of picking leaders but is, and has been, supportive of the people’s aspirations. #Libya
On @GMA this morning, reaffirmed support for people of #Libya. US and int’l community will keep pressure on #Qadhafi until he steps down
On Early Show w/@EricaRHill, said while exile may be option for #Qadhafi, wherever he goes he will face international legal justice.
We’re going to keep the pressure on. #Libya
Violate human rights and be held accountable. Or stop violence and respect #Libya’s call for change. No escaping that critical choice.
#Qadhafi sounds, frankly delusional. Shows how disconnected he is from reality. #Libya
When #Qadhafi can laugh and talk to journos while he is slaughtering his own people, only underscores how unfit he is to lead. #Libya
