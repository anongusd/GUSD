Many state Housing Finance Agencies are working to encourage affordable housing. See which states have explicitly promoted housing in high opportunity areas: https://t.co/Cx5vG5cgkA
In high opportunity areas, there are specific challenges for creating &amp; preserving existing affordability. @FreddieMac illustrates the economics of LIHTC &amp; other tools to keep rents affordable for working families where housing is drastically unavailable. https://t.co/dpYvdMgw7J
Nearly 20% of the population lives within an area of concentrated poverty. @FreddieMac's paper explores mixed-income housing's ability to deconcentrate poverty and promote better economic opportunity. Read: https://t.co/bDVscieLnZ
Broad-based opportunity matters for local growth, but the reverse is also true. Economic expansion has not always led to shared prosperity, but it will be hard to achieve inclusion without sustained overall growth &amp; connecting more people to key segments of the advanced economy. https://t.co/Lf3Ogz7ZFh

Eliminating Housing Bonds would mean higher borrowing costs for state and local governments, significantly less investment in affordable housing, and fewer jobs. The tax exemption on Housing Bonds must be retained in order to sustain the Housing Credit’s production potential.
Preserve the tax exemption on multifamily Housing Bonds. Without Housing Bonds, Housing Credit development could be reduced by as much or more than 50 percent annually. Housing affordability gap will grow.
Is the affordable housing crisis about to get worse? Recent analysis found that repealing PABs would result in 788k-881k fewer affordable rental homes built/preserved over next 10 years. #SaveHousingBonds
Tax reform should bring broad benefits to the economy, but the cost of capital remains high in severely distressed communities. #NMTC is a bipartisan solution in communities hit hardest by economic downturns and the dwindling job opportunities. #InvestinWhatWorks
