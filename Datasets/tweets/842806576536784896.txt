@LogicalLeft1 No ads No posters No buttons No bumberstickers No filing fees No consultants No analysts. If you can't inspire for free, then🤐
@LogicalLeft1 It is easy. Ban money. Ban FPTP. Open up the ideological market. No1 should be being paid 2 politic volunteers only or nothing
@LogicalLeft1 Money in the political system is like vomit or diarrhea: you gotta get it aaaallll out, then everyone will feel much better 🤢
@LogicalLeft1 How is any1 supposed to trust the process if determined by the person with the most cash, regardless of where it all came from
@LogicalLeft1 That candidate is still PURCHASED. And her votes are also PURCHASED and with no way to know how her ppl really think and feel.
@LogicalLeft1 @KimWeaverIA no one  should have 2 make deals/hold their nose when voting/rep'ing No one should be ignored 4 their conscience
@LogicalLeft1 @KimWeaverIA No, voting as the natural, unadulterated collective WILL of the ppl you represent is what youre supposed to do.
@LogicalLeft1 Good on you. I wish you both luck in any case.
@LogicalLeft1 So unless @KimWeaverIA is talking electoral restructuring, she's just another shill, except she's being bribed by the people.
@LogicalLeft1 yeah all donors, whether that donor is one lone billionaire or one billion loners. Both are equivalent in my opinion &amp; in fact
@LogicalLeft1 Yeah. A combo of AV, STV, MMP. FPTP makes for unholy alliances, gives our existing fringe groups too much political capital.
@LogicalLeft1 well each system is outgrowth of old never replacement. 1st step is getting rid of first-past-the-post and see where it goes
@LogicalLeft1 no it has everything 2 do with democracy being fundamentally flawed. If ppls ideas can be bought/sold r they really sovereign?
@LogicalLeft1 if you r right, then if @KimWeaverIA wins it won't be bc NW Iowans are suddenly tolerant, just that they were rebrainwashed 🤑
@LogicalLeft1 no it's a democracy. What matters is the will of the ppl. And the will of the ppl of Siouxland is we want racist @SteveKingIA
@LogicalLeft1 Interesting. A racist network finds profitable audience in Sioux City, IA. Could it be bc the audience buys what's for sale?!🤔
