@mwpetty007 @_Almaqah Shapiro.
@wayfindingPK Right. NYC needs basic transit priority, congestion charging, and investment in maintenance to get back to where they should be. 		TNC specific charges happen when you don't want to upset taxi drivers or suburban drivers.
@wayfindingPK I think TNCs can be complementary to transit but in cities like New York they are contributing to massive gridlock. 		Congestion pricing will help, especially if that money goes to transit.
@wayfindingPK What helps is that both cities are increasing service hours, investing in transit priority, and reducing parking requirements.
@wayfindingPK I don't know if I would go that far. We don't know if transit ridership would have increased even faster without TNCs.

@BrideandBloomLA @alexedelstein @MikeBoninLA Yup. Good talking with you. Night!
@BrideandBloomLA @alexedelstein @MikeBoninLA It won't work for everyone but those are less cars on the road.
@BrideandBloomLA @alexedelstein @MikeBoninLA I work in a professional office with mostly women and many of us bike to work. We also have safe bike paths to our office.
@BrideandBloomLA @alexedelstein @MikeBoninLA Half of all trips are 3 miles or less. Definitely within the realm of bicycling if there were safe paths as part of a low stress network.
@BrideandBloomLA @alexedelstein @MikeBoninLA Mike Bonin has been great about pushing for accountability with Measure M $$$. That needs to continue so service can be rolled out sooner.
@BrideandBloomLA @alexedelstein @MikeBoninLA But we can't wait for rapid transit lines to be completed across LA to build our local safe bicycling network. (2/2)
@BrideandBloomLA @alexedelstein @MikeBoninLA Realize there are tradeoffs to traffic calming/road diet projects like these. We need a regional solution for rapid transit (1/2).
@BrideandBloomLA @alexedelstein @MikeBoninLA Transit could definitely be a lot better. We need to make sure Measure M money results in better bus service at the local level much sooner.
@BrideandBloomLA @alexedelstein @MikeBoninLA Improved lighting, crosswalks, wider sidewalks, and bicycle paths are all part of the solution. We can't keep prioritizing space for cars.
@BrideandBloomLA @alexedelstein @MikeBoninLA There is a huge safety issue right now. This is a big reason @LADOTofficial has committed to Vision Zero to reduce roadway deaths/injuries.
@BrideandBloomLA @alexedelstein @MikeBoninLA Yes. Born and raised in Los Angeles. I've ridden my bike on all of those roads and the road diets help make them safer.
@alexedelstein @MikeBoninLA Expanding lanes for cars is not progressive. We need to prioritize transit, bicycling, and walking. Give people better options.

@calwatch @rouge8 This issue won't go away so if Measure H doesn't pass let's hope the next version gets it right. We'll see.
@calwatch @rouge8 I think this would have passed if it was on the November ballot. I get why some people had reservations though.
@HawthorneLAT Yes definitely. The early numbers are encouraging.
@HawthorneLAT I think it loses by 15%.
@gronquil That's right and it's just under 62% right now. The rest of the votes will have to be stronger for it to pass.
Great news for LA as both Measure S is losing by 20% and Measure H is winning by 30%! These are preliminary numbers. #LAvotes #NoonS #YesOnH
@ericaengelhardt There's a reason the ACLU, the Democratic Party, Governor Brown, and affordable housing groups are saying #NOonS.
@ericaengelhardt Most likely because this measure would stop many good projects as well and is funded by wealthy NIMBYs.
