More or less childish than illegally threatening to tow someone while they’re on the premises because you’re on a power trip? 		Sorry dude, I’m fake crying before I pay a total of $600 &amp; waste my whole afternoon b/c some guy is on a power trip. https://t.co/6ye6zfsD7J

@m_wacker I do. I think the app I use doesn’t have the thread feature regular twitter does.
@awpurser Wow okay. I really wanna get this guy in trouble. It was total bs.
@TheLastStawp No, I did the boot to myself. Not the rest.
@awpurser For real?
@fredlow71 Ugh
@OverlookedRVA Nope
@RShacklefordTX No he’s not. Threatening to tow me is not his job.
@JChrist918 No this scam they boot you so you have to pay right away and can’t fight a ticket.
Oooooh so tempted!!!!!!!! https://t.co/OKTKUKJPQ6
@TheLastStawp I already said that
@awpurser Yep
@KrissyCougar Really?
(6/) So after realizing he’s dead set on towing me for keeping him from booting some other poor schmuck, I go last-ditch move: Call my husband &amp; fake cry on the phone. 		He backed down. I paid for the scam boot &amp; got the hell out of there.		I hope that dude gets raging butt acne.
(5/) Again, I ask why he’s mad at me for telling someone not to park in the lot if his job is to keep people from parking in the lot. 		He gets angrier &amp; says he’s gonna charge me for the boot &amp; tow me &amp; make me go pick it up across town for another $400 fee. Cool power trip.
(4/) people from parking in the lot, why is he mad at me for telling the guy not to park here. Because he has no good answer other than the honest one (this is a total scam to make money &amp; his goal is to trap people) he gets even angrier at me &amp; says instead he’s going to tow me.
(3/) I yelled to him “Dont park here. You’ll get booted. U can’t park here.” And the boot dude freaks out on me &amp; says he’s going to go take care of something else down the street before me &amp; I can just sit here &amp; wait til he’s done &amp; comes back.		I ask, if his job is to keep...
(2/) Worse? When that guy gets on a power trip &amp; can’t even pretend to hide that it’s a money-making hustle for the lot owners. 		Today, while processing the exorbitant fee he charged me to take the boot off, someone else parked next to me. As he got out &amp; started walking away
Brief rant: Is there a worse job than the guy who waits in a parking lot to put the boot on someone’s car when they run in &amp; out of a store to pick something up? 		I get it, don’t park there, but a minute or two buffer before putting on the boot is just being a human being. (1/)
Thank you! I really hope people will listen &amp; get as much from it as I did. 		https://t.co/ot5rh4BHWX https://t.co/t4R34DtNNC
@RocGert @SharzadKiadeh Thank you! I think they’re amazing, too!

@CristinaTarrin1 @efs120 @jemelehill @AmirTalai Huh? I’m not saying he didn’t participate, I’m saying legally and in terms of nfl punishment they’ll likely want to establish whether he thought he was soliciting a consenting prostitute or knowingly participating in a trafficking ring,

@EGBHoops @WorldExposureWB @rschuman @NebraskaAttack @PBevBallNPrep @BlakeDuDonis @RebeccaLobo @LaChinaRobinson @GrindHouseBB Context matters. Are there enough girls tourneys available for this team? Is their area lacking competitive girls teams? Speculating about why they chose to enter is pointless. The issue is why the boys teams refused to play them - it’s not b/c they want to advance girls ball.
@EGBHoops @WorldExposureWB @NebraskaAttack @PBevBallNPrep @BlakeDuDonis @RebeccaLobo @LaChinaRobinson That matters a lot. The way you initially wrote it, your point seemed to be that boys and girls should never play together.

@JoshFnBowler @SpainandFitz that's really sad, i hope she's better. worth noting though - whether or not the food stays down the enjoyment of it is more what you're paying for. i'm guessing you're not paying that much because it's "more nutritious" at that price.
@TheStringTeam @rschuman @NebraskaAttack @PBevBallNPrep @BlakeDuDonis @RebeccaLobo @EGBHoops @LaChinaRobinson @WorldExposureWB Just like any other tournament - you win or you lose.

@J_Rosa23 @jemelehill Right... which is what I said first in the tweet. 🤷‍♀️
@gb8200 @BenMcCoy08 "Of course" was meant to say "the obvious concern is with him and his team" or "it goes without saying that the injury is brutal for him and his team." I realize now people didn't read it as such.

@mjames09 There's no value placement. There's no claim that there's any equality of seriousness. It's merely an acknowledgement that in addition to the obvious--hopefully the injury isn't serious and he's okay--losing a player like that in a big game is a disappointment.

@VanniBoo12 The issues are unrelated. I agree the NCAA is corrupt &amp; athletes should be paid. I also acknowledge the reality that the injury is disappointing 4 people excited to see him play. Your inexplicable anger is seriously misplaced. Don't let being online inspire unwarranted rudeness.
@jpo_598 Ahhhh the ol stick to sports angle. Got it now. : )
@jpo_598 ??
@mjames09 How so? Acknowledging that a star player going down to injury is a disappointment to fans isn't insensitive, it's a fact.
@k_fraud_chicken It's a reality that a star player going down to injury in a massive rivalry game is a huge bummer. It doesn't mean that disappointment matters even a thousandth as much as whether he's okay, but it also doesn't mean that truth doesn't exist.

Man, you still don't get it. The end of this case isn't a ruling that police brutality has ended &amp; equality of treatment will be the way of the land going forward. The end of this case is "we colluded, here's your money." He got it. Now he can go back to the cause. https://t.co/UIiaNXJAWw
@ASOM233334 @SpainandFitz @Jason1Goff 😍
@cselby121 @Dee_Marketing @Rob2TheDunc Do your research. https://t.co/lpqCeZbZgA
Again, the CAUSE and the CASE are different. 		He is continuing to champion the cause - this settlement didn't end that fight. 		This settlement concerns specifically the collusion that kept him out of the league. He has recouped the losses for that collusion. https://t.co/DJGKlhtSrz

@TruthfulBurns Just using a few as examples to get some logic out into the world.
Right, but this case was ABOUT money. The settlement proves that Kaep's case (&amp; what would come out in discovery) were intimidating enough to force the NFL's hand. If the end goal is to recoup lost wages, then settling 4 them versus getting them @ end of the case matters little. https://t.co/kr35981ryT
Agreed. And @CharlesRobinson made that point on @SpainandFitz earlier - check the NFL's history on these suits. They don't settle. https://t.co/MRsLBbf8Vt
So what you're saying is, years ago he started kneeling hoping all the teams would collude against him, he'd get blackballed, get a Nike deal and make big bucks on a settlement? Long con. Heady play. https://t.co/9BUmLaHQWc
@quackenwhatever @Rob2TheDunc Check the NFL's record on this. They don't settle.
@grose_guy @espn thank you

@Paulie3323 @hannbannan24 hey thanks!
. @JustinTinsley joins @SpainandFitz NEXT to talk about the Kaepernick settlement.
Don't conflate the CAUSE with the CASE. 		The CAUSE is what started this &amp; what he continues to champion. 		The CASE was about the career he missed out on &amp; the years of salary he didn't get. 		The CASE WAS about money and doesn't in any way change his work toward the CAUSE. https://t.co/uEMwO5ABZN
@Rob2TheDunc He wasn't trying to make a statement, he was suing the league for his career ending unfairly due to collusion. His CAUSE is different from the CASE that resulted because of it.
Pre-show convo was about drafting him higher than some of the Duke stars &amp; whether quality of competition should worry NBA folks. Question on the air much shorter. There's the context for ya of why it became about Duke's stars. https://t.co/yJ8XP6ShdK

@Dpayne333 @1969herbsuperb @magnaccione Yeah, all of the comments in this thread were agreeing with each other - including Daniels', which was a hypothetical take from an anti-kaep person grasping at straws.
RT @AroundtheHorn: Here's a candid behind the scenes look at the panel wading through the news and immediate opinions on the Kaepernick/NFL…
@JFent08 @TexasBearFan34 He didn’t complain about his job. He complained about racial inequality.
@bobbo10735 Have not seen the 5 mil reported. I’ve already gone over all the reasons he wouldn’t want to play in the AAF. Has nothing to do with playing in nfl.
@bobbo10735 Name them. Besides $225k for three years in dev league.
@BradSpencer He did work out for them. You need to avoid whichever news sources you’re getting info from.
@1JEL1 Never, which was my point
@chone_figgins @WaddleandSilvy About addy or otherwise?
@1JEL1 I didn’t mean to sound like I was judging - I was saying I was sad that this would give his opponents some bs to spin.
@Secory25 👍🏻
@BradSpencer They didn’t. Neither team offered him a contract.
@masher2112 @CanadaBue @OldGoalieDB78 😂
@Secory25 Okay and agreed
@1JEL1 Btw I’m defensive about your anger at me for not immediately seeing every side just after news breaks, but I agree w your cynicism re AAF and will be speaking to it.
@1JEL1 We reacted in the moment. It had just hit. Stop. 		Have a good one.
@Secory25 “No thanks” certainly implies a tone. Have a good one.
@word2yamotha24 Needed to enter free agency, was going to get cut and not get money. Go back and do your research.
@1JEL1 Was just talking to someone about nfl + AAF connection and now I’m absolutely seeing their desire to both get pub and muddy the collusion case being announced today. I didn’t last night in immediate reaction. Not about supporting a league, just about initial response.
@1JEL1 No, it’s that people who have been full of shit all along will misread this and use this to support their shit positions
@EpicJeffTime @akell0828 :)
@Secory25 Haha figures
@Tinoladobo Gross
@ASOM233334 @OTLonESPN I heard the opposite. I’ll have to check it out.
@word2yamotha24 He was getting cut. Do your research.
@Secory25 Check my timeline re why succeeding there wouldn’t matter. Don’t wanna get into it again.
The suit &amp; what’s surely a massive payment will do more than enough to discourage the nfl from future similar situations. Kaepernick has done more than could ever be asked in the name of the cause - he lost his career, became a public pariah, saw his intentions &amp; cause twisted. https://t.co/bvM25j0ia8
@1JEL1 Oh you mean about them using this offer to him and Tebow for pub? Yeah we didn’t say that last night. Hadn’t occurred to me in the immediate response to the news.
@1JEL1 Did you listen to full segment? I’m sorry I don’t know what you’re getting at. I’ve made my points all day today - even more thought out and fleshed out than last night.
@extremeboy_ryan @DunlapSports @jose3030 No. His cause is separate from the collusion case.
@aaron_m_lambert Oh no. I’ll have to listen later.
@JoeMomma833 @kohalloran25 @OhioUBobcats Wrong. The collusion case is not the cause.
Yep. People will find any way to spin this so they don’t have to acknowledge what happened. https://t.co/8qA8BP1A9z
@tlyons507 @abskhir @AroundtheHorn Today!
@Secory25 Of course he does, but he wasn’t working because of his protest, so proving talent and desire over and over again won’t change that.
@hoguemichael1 There’s been no proof
Exactly. And a judge ordering the case to trial proved there was merit to the case and that burden of proof was at least superficially met. https://t.co/fmf5TJ1VIP
No. Kneeling was about social justice and equality of treatment. 		The collusion case was about having his career cut short unfairly. https://t.co/vfDM2QXTDh
@tlyons507 @abskhir It was, which resulted in him not working and not getting paid. Paying him to not pursue means they don’t want stuff public and/or admit truth in his case.
Again, if he had been out of the league because people didn’t think he wanted a job, this would be a great solution.		He doesn’t need to prove talent or desire - neither were the reason he wasn’t employed. https://t.co/MgDMSaEfgX
He doesn’t have to be a martyr to prove anything. He lost significant money because of a career that was unfairly cut short. He’s allowed to do whatever he wants with the money the NFL has no agreed he’s owed. https://t.co/ZBjkt54S16
@tyler_jones36 We don’t know that yet
Good thing the Ravens didn’t just give away their starter for a running QB then. Oh no. Wait. https://t.co/TzWtEIpP6M
@JoeSantiago316 And Kaepernick never did. It wasn’t up to Vick to get the chance.
@mack24x7 @Kaepernick7 @NFL Gives a platform to maybe, in that more people see it. But it’s being proven wrong, which can be important for some to see if they’re uninformed or haven’t made a decision.
@Vaphilly624 Problem is people will use one game samples to say the opposite.
@tlyons507 How so?

@MacklenMak Thank you
If the reason he isn’t playing in the first place was never his talent, then talent isn’t what needs to be demonstrated. Especially not at a lower level, surrounded by lesser talent, for lesser money. 		Goalposts will just move to “wouldn’t translate in the NFL.” https://t.co/IoWr86NlBF

@jtbarabasz I don’t know what his side has in terms of proof for a collusion case—hopefully it will all be made public when the ruling is made.
@1JEL1 I’m saying his request is NOT a cash grab and that the AAF would make tons off him.
I agree the court case is tough to prove. But how he plays three years after the start of all this, in a different league, won’t be any easier to use in a case re: NFL play. https://t.co/s0qqqgRaDH
@blaunder Can you send me proof that he’s gotten offers in the NFL and turned them down because of the money?
He was the first, the highest profile &amp; became the face of the movement. He was singled out by the President &amp; others, made into a talking point, a human dividing line for “sides” of a debate that was never even about the cause for which he kneeled. https://t.co/O5H3035uvb
Are the Eagles an AAF team? 		Did Kaepernick commit a federal crime? https://t.co/wPOUGHYkcM
@OldGoalieDB78 Don’t need all those other invented ABCs, it’s plain why he wouldn’t want to play in the AAF. A brutal sport at a lower level with minimal pay? Why?
Only if you actually believe he doesn’t have a job in the NFL b/c of talent, which most know is not the case. Countless other QBs have been signed who never had his ceiling &amp; had lower lows.		Playing with lesser talent at a lower level won’t change what happened 3 years ago. https://t.co/HJIpxlvydt
@Tay87508378 Yep
No, that makes it sound like an attempted cash grab or like a number thrown out in the hopes they’ll actually bite. He knows the AAF can’t pay it, he’s using that number b/c he’s reiterating his worth, which is as a starting QB in the NFL. It’s the exact halfway point for QB $. https://t.co/oG6csOUfQq
And don’t think for a second that the $20 mil number is arbitrary. He believes himself to be as good or better than half the QBs in the NFL. By giving that number to the AAF, which could never pay a player that much, he’s reiterating that he belongs in the NFL, not a dev. league. https://t.co/M5dVBI4bh6
@blackdontrump Elway offer came before protests. Those who use that to defend his "chances" have to this point been disingenuous in their arguments. Perhaps you just didn't know, but not being involved enough in story to know says something, too. https://t.co/lpqCeZbZgA
Activism doesn't require martyrdom or suffering. Playing in a lesser league for lesser money (&amp; making that league rich, btw) won't erase the very real NFL boycott that happened. 		@jason1goff &amp; I had a good convo about this - final segment here: https://t.co/FsdAnicK7t https://t.co/tIYT9lwRMo
@blackdontrump Not interested in relitigating stuff that's been discussed for years, especially since some of your facts are wrong. We can agree to disagree.
@blackdontrump Because 16 QBs in the NFL ave 20 mil &amp; that's where he values himself. He's never been unsigned because of talent, so going to the AAF to "prove" his talent (with factors he can't control like quality of fball, teammates, etc) won't change whether teams will sign him.

@EDunnVintner @GolicAndWingo Those two issues are related, though. Inability to handle alcohol and/or alcohol-related issues obviously affect the ability to do a job in the liquor industry.
@PBRKessler I agree with that, but every situation is different and I don’t believe all deserve the same response/penalty.
@MikeZimmersEars Agreed that we need to believe that change has taken place and he’s genuinely interested in understanding and treating his issues.
Comparing the awfulness of the situations isn’t the point, but I see an assault on a stranger as much less abhorrent than the abuse of a loved one. A moment of rage vs an act meant to control &amp; intimidate. https://t.co/RrAWnE6xCl
(2/2) That being said, I don’t know that this assault should end his career.  We will need the team &amp; Hunt to be transparent about understanding the root cause of his issues (which appear to be anger/alcohol based on his treatment) &amp; explain why they believe treatment will work. https://t.co/tFzlpnk7KV
I am in no way defending him. I just don’t always believe one-&amp;-done is the right policy. 		I also don’t believe in the speed with which he’s been signed, when the investigation is still pending. How can the Browns know with certainty he’s treated his issue? (1/) https://t.co/tFzlpnk7KV

It really matters. If a team takes on Hunt &amp; hasn't taken the time to understand the difference between assault &amp; domestic violence, how can we trust that they'll handle the incident correctly? DV is usually a cycle of abuse, not a one time incident,  (1/) https://t.co/ok8fh0ZDLF

@bigtoonah @danpfeiffer @minakimes @AsteadWesley Totally agree. I'm fine with him repeating the same line - "I'm focused on this year, I'll talk about FA when we get there" - over and over again., But remember this particular blow-up stemmed from a question about skipping media availability post KP trade.
@bigtoonah @danpfeiffer @minakimes @AsteadWesley I don't begrudge him his frustration, I do take issue with telling reporters to grow up and abstaining from media sessions because he doesn't like the game. I don't think it serves him.
@bigtoonah @danpfeiffer @minakimes @AsteadWesley But simply accepting "I'm focused on this year" and not writing about potential landing spots/what sources are saying isn't a reporter doing his/her job. KD might find speculation frustrating, but it's part &amp; parcel of the job.
@bigtoonah @danpfeiffer @minakimes @AsteadWesley Part of the reason the NBA is as successful as ever is player movement. Media will inevitably cover that player movement. KD might prefer to just play bball, but that's not how professional sports works. Talking to &amp; dealing with media is part of it, that's why the $$ is so big.
@bigtoonah @danpfeiffer @minakimes @AsteadWesley I didn't say they'd stop hounding him. It may be frustrating to repeat yourself as reporters keep digging for information, but it leads to less speculation than going quiet immediately after the team you're rumored to be interested in makes a big trade.
@cedfunches @danpfeiffer @minakimes @AsteadWesley https://t.co/HOlEWWA1dC
@danpfeiffer @minakimes @AsteadWesley Do this too often &amp; he's seen as sensitive/soft, which feeds the narrative that he went to GS to coast. That could eventually affect his legacy/endorsements &amp; the way fans perceive him. And of course the way influential media members write and talk about him can do the same.
@danpfeiffer @minakimes @AsteadWesley Not talking is what's got him so fired up, though. By refusing to speak to reporters post KP trade he's left them to speculation. Seems he'd be better served by talking &amp; working to keep focus on the now than staying silent &amp; forcing writers to speculate for content.
@danpfeiffer We've seen the burner accounts negatively affect his rep for a lot of people (tho the same ppl were likely already anti-KD for going to GS). You're right re: $, as it's likely more predicated on how/where he plays than what he says. As for legacy, think his play will cement that.
RT @espn: YOU KNOW WHAT DAY IT IS @wojespn https://t.co/iZ9t423Piy
@danpfeiffer We've seen this trend coming for quite some time as more teams add in-house writers &amp; digital video content, but that biased coverage, like athlete social media channels, will never satisfy the public. It's easier now, sure, but he can't fully avoid cooperating w/out criticism.

@Kevin_D_Webb Maybe he’ll elaborate, but we’ll always wonder whether he was pushed to say the right thing because of backlash. Having those thoughts &amp; going out to act on them is abhorrent enough, years later still not understanding the real issue with those thoughts is seriously troubling.
@Kevin_D_Webb I think too often ppl label long overdue reactions to ingrained misogyny, racism etc as “outrage culture” b/c they’re not used to things being called out.		That being said, Neeson is surely different, but his “lesson” - that revenge is never right - isn’t the right lesson there.
@Kevin_D_Webb I believe you can do all of that when it’s earned. And forgiveness doesn’t mean the person is deserving of another opportunity in the same space/job.

@Frankiefingerz8 Sadly, sometimes very true.
@bjizzle40 I didn’t say he excused Briles’ acts, he’s excusing his own self-serving interests (better football team) by demanding forgiveness and grace.
@CJ_Feher Funny, that’s almost exactly what @GlobeBobRyan said on the ATH conf call this am.
@attorney_troy Personally I don’t agree with the idea that simply confessing absolves, particularly when there are no guarantees that he’s changed and would act differently going forward. I’m not religious, though, so I can’t fall back on those ideas to buoy “second chances” for evil people.
@neozenov Yes, he’s saying that belief allows him to think that bettering his football team is more important than the safety and well being of students. Gross.
@DanHajducky I got it :)

@qwan84 Just checked your timeline and you’ve made a habit of going after me, whether that’s calling me an “angry lady,” saying I backpedal in points or calling me a homer. What an odd obsession/waste of time. Have a good one.
@World_W_No_End @Pcengrat @RadioJoe7 https://t.co/6lA9snEy4w
@qwan84 A ROLE is not a tie. As I tweeted earlier, I clarified that because many don’t know the different Ricketts family members and what they do. I’ve never said he didn’t fun. I said - accurately - he has no role. He has no job, makes no decisions, etc. Many don’t know that.
@AndrewRei15 Def not
If u need to misrepresent what I said to make ur pt, ur in trouble. I said Joe doesn’t have a role—he doesn’t.		If I wanted to be a social activist I’d have to quit my job. My voice is more powerful &amp; useful as is. Sometimes it’s tough, but ultimately worth it, at least for now. https://t.co/yQi7LWDb4M
@scotthess Thanks. It’s definitely a choice. I mute, block &amp; ignore a lot, but some repeat falsehoods that I want to disprove and others share beliefs/opinions that I think followers would benefit hearing an opposing opinion on. Appreciate you getting the intent.
@qwan84 (2/) That isn’t the same as looking the other way, which I clearly haven’t. You’re welcome to question anyone with particular ideals/beliefs supporting any pro or college team, but to say I haven’t challenged the team on issues is simply wrong.
@qwan84 It’s the right link. You weren’t patient enough to see that, which isn’t a surprise.		I don’t agree with the politics of the all of the members of the family, nor do I agree with the politics of most ownership groups in professional sports. It’s a constant conflict for many. (1/)
We’re really gonna do this again? Only one who seems to be looking the other way is you. 		https://t.co/Q6QSgPoWLe https://t.co/v3R2KdQvTF
@CorRodriguez Agreed.
@World_W_No_End @Pcengrat @RadioJoe7 No, I’m saying the cumulative effect of Todd’s new positions, the Sinclair partnership, Joe’s emails, etc might put internal pressure (via Laura/Tom etc) for Todd’s political jobs to be questioned and/or for them to change his role w team.
@ElJefe322 Thanks
@movies03 I’m allowing for the fact that not all players are the same. You don’t have to agree.
@movies03 Also from his emails https://t.co/zWZrp8aBBf
@movies03 Not just his emails, ties to the president and his policies. Also, not all players are only concerned with issues that effect people of their own race - many, yes, not all.
@movies03 The issues clearly don’t just affect black players.
@jzacharyr ?
@World_W_No_End @Pcengrat @RadioJoe7 There may be internal efforts to force Todd to step back from his political positions. The reaction from many fans to this, the proposed new network partnership w/ Sinclair &amp; Joe’s emails could force their hand.
@CorRodriguez Makes no difference to whom? Makes no difference in regards to what?
@XopherFL :(
@TMP2008 Didn’t say anything close to that.
@CorRodriguez Oh, I would think absolutely, yes.
@ASOM233334 Wow
https://t.co/wwgpqCxWuV https://t.co/yt6aHvgC78
@RyanQDavis Eh, maybe. But she’s called the owner by name and has say in things, he’s not and doesn’t.
@qwan84 Read what I just wrote. You’re way off.
(4/) Apologies if I didn’t make my thoughts clear the first time, but I also would suggest that those who assume I’m carrying water for this team or any other Chicago team do their research. https://t.co/oJCnkFk19M
(3/) ...themselves from Trump’s views &amp; policies. This will assuredly create difficulties in the clubhouse &amp; amongst staff and already has Cubs fans reconsidering their fandom. 		Because of all of these issues, I DO think it will be interesting to see what TOM, LAURA, etc do. https://t.co/oJCnkFk19M
(2/) And I wouldn’t be surprised to learn that Todd, who IS a co-owner &amp; who helps run the team, shares the same opinions his father does. 		Because of the very clear political interests &amp; work Todd does, it is becoming increasingly difficult for Cubs ownership to distance... https://t.co/oJCnkFk19M
Let me clarify, since ppl are oddly reading this as some sort of defense or obfuscation of truth.		I clarified that JOE doesn’t have a role b/c many don’t know which Ricketts family members actually run the team. His money made the buy possible. He’s not just a random dad. (1/) https://t.co/oJCnkFk19M
@World_W_No_End @Pcengrat @RadioJoe7 I believe Todd likely has the same opinions as his dad. Not sure how anything I wrote implies otherwise,
@startup_brian @JulieDiCaro If didn’t do that. He doesn’t have a role w/ the team is accurate - I clarified that b/c many people don’t know which Ricketts are the ones actually running the team. As I said, his team association is clear! And so is Todd’s, who IS an owner &amp; likely shares many of his opinions.

@100RealRd2 That wasn't that person's point. I assumed you didn't read it because why else would someone defend hoping to kill an innocent man because he shares the skin color of a rapist?
@AndrewPrince5 @LeBatardShow Yes, that's better than doing it and better than not realizing it was problematic. But that doesn't mean he doesn't still harbor deep-seated beliefs about particular races/ethnicities/religions. Either you think humans are humans or you don't.
@DanielHQNWA @LeBatardShow He gave you context.
@100RealRd2 @LeBatardShow Are you defending people who beat up LGBTQ people or are you using that whataboutism to distract from Neeson's intentions?
@AndrewPrince5 @LeBatardShow Going out with a weapon hoping to murder a random innocent black person isn't just "stupid." That mindset can't be seen as wholly independent of deeper beliefs. He's revealing himself in a way that seems downright unmarketable and unpalatable. Then again, Mel Gibson.

So that I could kill him.”
@rickstutts46 ha!
The "So I guess you've never done anything wrong?" line of thinking whenever someone criticizes a horrific act is insidious.

@DanteDinardo @LeBatardShow If you think someone saying they went out hoping to come across an innocent black man to kill isn't an admission that should tank his career, I don't want you as a fan.
@Thejakeoltmann @LeBatardShow Considered murdering an innocent, totally random black person because that's the color of the skin of the person who didn't something to his friend. No, it's not okay to just know that it's wrong.

@britrobotista agreed, except i say guarantees b/c in the nfl we know the players have no power so we advocate for their rights. in the nba players get screwed but teams also get screwed by injuries/guys underperforming.

You might not agree with it, but it's actually not lazy at all. It's based on a more nuanced look at player empowerment--which I support--and how it makes it difficult for organizations to succeed. Guaranteed deals make things complicated in the NBA. https://t.co/iHWm8hnANg

Totally happens! So does a team signing a player for huge money &amp; seeing his play drop significantly once he got the cash. I'm pro player, but there's some balance and nuance needed in these discussions. https://t.co/Rzn8tpUb99
I'm all for player empowerment, but have you ever seen a player miss a season to injury or vastly underperform &amp; offer to give the team their money back? Maybe these days it's not worth signing a 5-year deal for security &amp; cash if you're worried you'll want out before it's done. https://t.co/fBxE56Zdc3

Totally agree! But if players can now force trades mid-contract, how can we ask teams to be loyal? I'm all for player empowerment, I'm just not sure where the tipping point is on teams not being able to plan &amp; build if every contract can be broken. https://t.co/bk9H0s8Mti

@eepdllc @MikeyLang54 Yes, referring back to my original point - good players don't want to stay because the team being built around them can't compete.
@eepdllc @MikeyLang54 Nope. I said (quote!) "STARS DON'T WANNA GO OR STAY." That's because the team has been largely irrelevant for decades, has one of the worst owners in sports, can't find homegrown talent (see: aforementioned draft picks) or tempt big name FAs.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 https://t.co/if7jS50O1H
@BosToLax except no one is SAYING they're going to the trash bulls. that's my point.
@13thfloorbeer 100%. But no one is SAYING they're gonna go to Chicago. That's the difference.
@rawtalent1976 Cool. I'll wait.
@eepdllc @MikeyLang54 The Knicks being unable to draft good talent is 100% part of my point. How do you not get that?
@MassUpdater Can you send me the video? The whole issue with the case is that it's NOT on video. There are some ?s about his story, which is why I said not to rush to judgement. I'm 100% on the side of those fighting homophobia &amp; racism, but it serves no one to react before an investigation.

RT @GIBRILWILSON: @SarahSpain Quite an accomplishment for an NBA team to have more heisman winners than championships in the 21st century
@LennyStarkNJ Just Melo forcing a trade, no FAs other than Stoudemire.
@RKMeibalane Yes. Though to be fair Anthony forced his way to NY so he can essentially be considered like a FA who went there by choice.
@Rough_Cut85 @JosephZapataIII Stat must not include trades. In this case it was Melo wanting to go there, not a team sending him away, so I agree - it's two in 30 years.
@CollFballQuest Why does it have to be about balls? Choosing to go somewhere totally dysfunctional with terrible management is foolish, not ballsy.
@MassUpdater Not true at all. I said nothing even remotely that could be spun as not believing it happened.

@shaepeppler You’re agreeing with me. Bulls are a joke. UC isn’t MSG. They’re irrelevant. And that’s why no one floats KD, AD, Kyrie, Kawhi going to Chi. They do say that about NY and NY is even less relevant over last two decades, they’ve just got MSG. See what I’m saying?

As I’ve been saying, right now the Knicks are nothing more than a good market and a storied stadium. With this ownership &amp; track record no one wants to go there (or stay there). Big names get floated and until one of them actually chooses Dolan &amp; the Knicks I’m NOT BUYING IT.
