Day 32 of the #trumpshutdown. @realdonaldtrump and the Republicans controlled the House, Senate and White House for two years. Yet didn’t try to fund the wall. Did they know it was unpopular and would lose support?  This is clearly a political stunt. End the shutdown TODAY.

Border security is essential, but we shouldn't criminalize immigrant communities, militarize the borders or carry out policies that dont represent our values. Instead of funding a wall we should adopt comprehensive immigration reform to protect our border &amp; fix our broken system

The Unite the Right rallies taking place in Washington, D.C. are despicable. Racism, bigotry, and hate have no place in our country.
A recent study by @BrennanCenter found that states purged more than 16 million voters from the rolls between 2014 and 2016, 33% more than between 2006 and 2008. Read what Im doing to ensure that every voter is treated equally at the polls in @IndyRecorder  https://t.co/4HrMdYJqKT

@realdonaltrump said he misspoke on ONE word yesterday. Why then did several of his answers defer to #Putin? Why praise Putin as trustworthy source? And avoid condemning meddling? Or not ask for extradition of indicted 12? You can’t misspeak for an entire press conference.
Happening now- I’m standing with my colleagues after yesterday’s shocking summit. Tune in! https://t.co/mFg2DSBq9a
For those claiming partisanship, Hoosier  conservative &amp; our former GOP Senator Dan Coats—now Director of National Intelligence—responded to @realDonaldTrump that Russia meddled in the ‘16 election &amp; continues to meddle today. These are facts-not politics. https://t.co/659PDVeXIz
'Never before have we seen a president so dramatically set aside a vital American interest to appease the expectations of a foreign adversary.' My full statement on the #HelsinkiSummit here-&gt; https://t.co/aZ2dpe04pY
(4/4) This not how a President acts. He is abandoning American interests to protect Russia. It's time for Congressional Republicans to stand on the side of	evidence.
(3/4) The evidence is indisputable—the Russians interfered. And, now they admit they wanted Trump to win. @realdonaldtrump was elected to defend our democracy. Instead he believes Putin’s denial over abundant evidence presented by non-partisan American intelligence analysts.
(2/4) As Putin reminded us, he is a former KGB officer.	He won’t admit to an attack on our democracy just because the President asks.	We must follow the evidence. We can't let the President or politics disrupt	ongoing investigations.
(1/4) Today’s summit between President Trump &amp; Putin	was shocking. @realDonaldTrump refused to condemn Russian interference, instead blaming American victims. This isn’t just rhetoric. Its abandoning our	interests.
(2/2) It’s more clear than ever that @RealDonaldTrump should be holding President Putin accountable, not trying to strengthen relations w/ Russia at the expense of our allies.
(1/2) Today’s indictment proves what Democrats have been saying for months: that the Russian government directly interfered in the 2016 election &amp; continues to undermine our democracy today.

Discrimination is not a national security strategy, and prejudice is not patriotism. Trump’s xenophobic travel ban is an outright attack on the Muslim community that violates our nation’s commitment to liberty and justice for all.  #NoMuslimBanEver https://t.co/yCGdlpdItt
This decision is about presidential authority, NOT an affirmation of the President’s bigoted policy or history of targeting immigrants. His policy continues to hurt countless families across our country. Congress must vote to strike down this affront to our values as Americans. https://t.co/9u8mVnxXGm

Disappointing update today in #rail subcommittee hearing on pipeline safety from #Trump Administration. Congressional changes we passed years ago to save lives are still overdue.
Today, on #WorldRefugeeDay I call on @realDonaldTrump &amp; the #TrumpAdministration to end their cruel policy of separating families. No one chooses to become a refugee. We must continue to promote the safety &amp; well-being of vulnerable refugees as they seek a better life. https://t.co/Zfudbpkt9f
Promoting human rights has been an American priority for decades. By withdrawing from the UN Human Rights Council we lose an opportunity to drive change through dialogue. It’s tragic to allow violations and bias to go unaddressed through our absence.

(2/2)  I was proud to support our bipartisan bill to fund our military yesterday. But we can do more to protect Americans by tackling gun violence. When wars abroad get our support &amp; protecting people at home get ignored, we are failing at national security. https://t.co/Y6sn17AROo
(1/2) This #MemorialDay we will remember the 2,411 service members killed since 2001 and all who have died for our country. We cannot  forget that they died to protect us. But every day 96 of the Americans they fought for are killed with guns. 13,000 gun homicides per year. https://t.co/Y6sn17AROo

Need proof this is political? House Intelligence voted to declassify the memo today, sending it to @POTUS for approval. Yet White House says President Trump decided to declassify BEFORE HE READ IT! Republicans kept us from sending full story for declassification.
Mixing politics &amp; intelligence puts lives at risk. Both parties try hard to avoid it. That changed today. The public is about to see a memo that selectively omits details to create a false story. A dishonest attempt to discredit #Mueller’s investigation. #ReleaseTheOtherMemo

Happening now: For the second time, I am going to the floor to vote against the terrible GOP tax scam.
.@HouseGOP is voting again on their #GOPTaxScam because they rushed the process &amp; didn’t know what was in their own bill. As a reminder, it raises taxes on 86 million middle-class households while cutting taxes for the wealthy. https://t.co/6tIyPaTlmK
'Our country is in dire need of a modern tax code. But more than that, we need a tax code that supports those who work hard every day &amp; still struggle to get by. This bill does the opposite, which is why I voted against it in the House.' My statement-&gt;https://t.co/6IbtnZIDiy
On my way to the House Floor to vote NO on the #taxbill. This bill is a failed opportunity to grow our economy, boost small businesses &amp; help middle class Hoosiers get ahead.
You work hard for your paycheck. And of course you hate paying taxes. But it’s even worse watching your hard earned dollars pay for a massive tax break for millionaires &amp; billionaires. Let’s reform our tax code to help working families succeed. Not to make the rich richer.
Thousands of Hoosiers signed up for health insurance for the first time under the Affordable Care Act. Republicans are tossing aside affordable coverage to pay for their $1.5 trillion tax cut. The #goptaxscam will make Americans less healthy.
What is more shocking than Republicans adding $1.5 trillion to the debt, for our children &amp; grandchildren to pay for? Their hints that they might pay for it by cutting Medicare &amp; Medicaid. The #goptaxscam will hurt Americans for years to come.
Something is wrong when 80% of Hoosiers only get 31% of the tax breaks. No individual should be seeing a tax cut larger than an entire working neighborhood. Hoosiers deserve better. Oppose the #goptaxscam https://t.co/IatqU1Z3EX
