@BWAYsuperstar Oh, I wouldn't know just right off. I don't live in Indy no more. Go to a dealership with a decent down payment and get something new. Like a 2018 that has a warranty. $500 to $1000 down, you can get something new. They have to get rid of those 2018s. So they cheap right now.

@drhymer @realDonaldTrump I've been trying to create opportunities for almost 20 years. It's ok but not the American dream. I would like to see my hard work pay off. I would like to have $100M to invest or just enjoy. All I got out of hard work and dedication was a mountain of student loan debt n bills.
@macattack1962 @realDonaldTrump I understand. He only has 2 years left.
@KathieKuchta @realDonaldTrump I want to actually enjoy the country I helped build for all these years. It tired of having the clock in day after day and not being able to enjoy myself. I want to go on $10,000 vacations and buy my kids what ever they want. Unfortunately, I wasn't dealt those cards.
@macattack1962 @realDonaldTrump I'm patiently waiting for my President to fix the current situation. I just tired of hearing about what Obama did and Trump always pointing the finger at the media. Just get it done is all I'm saying.
@DannyD91208 @realDonaldTrump All we can do is wait and see.
@KathieKuchta @realDonaldTrump Just tired of hearing about what Obama did. I want to hear a plan and something intelligent from my President. I understand I have to give it time but, I hope he's able to get it done.
@Realityland @realDonaldTrump I would have to agree with you. Things are getting a little better far as the economy. I'm tired of hearing what Obama did, and I'm tired of hearing about what everyone is doing. What about us?
@macattack1962 @realDonaldTrump I'm just saying. What about us here in America? I getting tired of contributing and can't enjoy the country I helped build.
@GTAsportsnut @realDonaldTrump Well, I'm tired of being a slave for this country. I would like to enjoy my country that I helped build. I've paid taxes and have contributed for years and I feel like I'm not able to enjoy this beautiful country like some are able to do. When will I have the chance to enjoy it?
@drhymer @realDonaldTrump Well actually I'm not waiting for any handouts. I do have a career and actually a pretty good career. Also I'm currently in school. At the same time I feel that I haven't had the same opportunities as some. I want my President to notice and do something about it.

Can someone give me the truth for once? It would be nice to finally hear something real for a change.
@RealAlexJones When will you be interviewing someone from the left on your show? I would like to see you interview someone from the left and truly find out what it is the left is trying to do.
@rfreeman1995 Oh she's definitely qualified. I researched a little bit and she wouldn't be that far in her career being unqualified. It's commendable that her skills have been noticed.
@rfreeman1995 Actually because she qualified. But being black is also a great thing,  and for being the first black woman is definitely something that should be recognized.
