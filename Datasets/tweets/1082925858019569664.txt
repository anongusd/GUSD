As long as Democrats come along with God and stories about God's creation they are not Socialists.
The problem is, that what Democrats do is not Socialism. It is just acting good to get votes and to strive for power.
The problem of socialism is not  social security in the area of welfare and healthcare, it's the wrong economic decisions that can destroy a country. Stubborn leaders with blindness for problems are also a problem. Not only in Socialist countries.

How long do you want to conserve this God that doesn't exist like Santa Claus for you and your children?
Some day America will be a social, democratic country. I hope in this century.
It's like America is still governed by British religious hardliners instead of free Americans. America, land of the free, free people free of religion. Free to choose, still with respect to believers, if you believe in God or not.
@GOP please get rid of God from the American Government and its institutions. It has to be. We're in the 21st century and America should be, too. The American State of God has to go and the American Union of Republics ha to appear stronger than ever. It is ridiculous.
@SpeakerPelosi God's creation? Just another prove how conservative you are.
Being Anti to socialists is not left. I don't wanna know how many in the Democratic Intelligence Community want Maduro out of office. Probably all of them. @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems There is no left party in America!
God's creation. And those words in the 21st century. Fake left attitude to occupy a political view in the name of God. God does not exist.
@GOP I hate their fake left attitude just for votes.

I love you Mr. President. And I won't molest your family again. I can't swear on it because I don't believe in God. I'm stupid, sorry Mr. Blue bridge.
@SenSchumer Which line?
Has become.
Well I hope God won't be anymore in America when America became social. Albert Einstein immigrated to the USA 1940 and became an American citizen as jewish man wo didn't want to believe in God.
At least you can be openly gay in America without being stoned to death in public. Or not. Wouldn't recommend it to live on the gay side of life. Gay in a cocksuck way, of course.

@Joyhope98242718 well and I hope you don't need a kind listening device.
@Joyhope98242718 Is that a telephone number behind your name?
@Joyhope98242718 Thanks for following me but I suspect a hacker behind every follow. I'm sorry.
@SandraFluker1 please.
@SandraFluker1 don't nerve Sebastian. Or Paul. Or whatever my name is.
@NBCNews I hope that doesn't mean that we all have to die on cancer.
@SandraFluker1 I suspect you of being a hacker or a victim of a hacker. that is the meaning.

@MirrorWeirdNews Can it make me call Jeff Bezon?
@SandraFluker1 Would you please not follow me? Only hackers follow me and I hate it.
Please agree, I'm pretty sure that the people and voters know who had the idea for a border wall. Mr. President Trump and the Republican Party don't want to steal ideas and votes from your party! The applause for making America safe is yours!
@SpeakerPelosi You should really see that the border wall is an urgent problem that has to be solved with a bipartisan solution. You should tell this to the other members of your party. It needs to be off the desk. There is more than a border wall.
@yaakovkatz Don't worry Yaakov! They all talk bipartisan in the Congress about strong support for Israel! Don't worry! America is always Israels Ally!
@TwitterSupport Is it junkspam if I report people as hacked who follow me? Because it seems like for me interesting but molested and intimidated person, that only hackers or hacked people follow me!
@ShinobiNinja Hey Shinobi, do you know Daniela "Cutobi" Arndt?
@AvalosJohnE1 Please, stop following me! And in case it is not you, stop hacking other people's twitter account!
@PattiSmolarek stop following me!
@AvalosJohnE1 followed me and has probably a hacked account in case it was not created by a hacker.
@ElizabethMatfin to who you tweeting to? to me or to mckinney?
@mosabbir followed me and has probably a hacked account in case it was not created by a hacker.
@brandongroeny followed me and has probably a hacked account in case it was not created by a hacker.
@harley_rude followed me and has probably a hacked account in case it was not created by a hacker.
@RepDonBeyer I guess there are more victims because of a not existing, proper functioning border wall than the Federal state workers who don't receive paychecks! Come together and agree to a border wall and these Federal Workers don't have to suffer any longer under this Shutdown
@RepKevinBrady Thank you. I guess they had known the price, if they would be in power! They want all the applause and votes for the next election for them and only for them! But I guess you know that!
@RepChrisPappas And you think blocking border wall funding is governing? It is playing games on the back of the American people!
@RepJoeNeguse It was based on the disapproval of a border wall from your Democrats. If you Democrats had agreed long time ago, the Government would not be shut down and the President had not spoken yesterday.
@RepMarkTakano But you will deport people who came illegal to your country. And people shall not come illegal, so you don't have to deport them. Get it, America needs a wall!
@ravichahar27 followed me and has probably a hacked account in case it was not created by a hacker.
It should now be up to the homelands of the Drug Cartels to deal with these criminals! Not anymore up to the American Taxpayer to fight these crimes!
@SenCoonsOffice The border wall isn't as ineffective as covert Operations of the State Department inside Drug Cartels. The wall is much cheaper than all Operations together the State Department had run the last decades.
So what can stop the flow of meth and cocaine into the US except an expensive wall and expensive covert Operations of the State Department? The wall is a best way if you don't want to spend money on Operations and waste human lives in KIAs of Operatives.
@BryanMicheal12 followed me and has probably a hacked account in case it was not created by a hacker.
@RevoltPolitic followed me and has probably a hacked account in case it is not created by a hacker.
@RepKatieHill The President wants a bipartisan agreement to the border wall. That's all what he wants. If the Demns don't come to the table to negotiate it and want to use this border wall as bargain in a political game then you can't expect him to lift the Government Shutdown. It's that easy!
@mckinneytweets @KarlTurnerMP Maybe you should work to make the laws regarding wealth fare better just to make sure that unemployed people still can afford food and a home instead of criticizing the Government from decades ago for austerity politics.
@ClaraBr71554598 followed me and has probably a hacked account in case it is not created by a hacker.
I've got hacked by Agents of German Authorities for years and they got backed in every case. Even in the poisoning of the groceries I buy. When will this finally stop? When will the German #Witchhunt come here to an end? After my death only?
That only shows that securing an IT-Infrastructure is more than using an Antivirus Program and updating the Operating System regularly.
A Twitter hack has leaked hundreds of telephone numbers of German Representatives and Politicians. I wonder why they this time don't blame @Twitter and @Jack Dorsey, just like they blamed @Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg.
@NadineDorries Then why you even vote?
@Norrie30 @PeterGrantMP You should tell that to the callers of Nigel Farrage, if he does a call in in his Radio Show!
Must be a Russian hacker. Of course not! #WitchHunt
@Twitter Well I wont receive calls like the Politicians because my Hacker, who is terrorizing me for years, would like to stay 'anda cover' how they say in German without any Voice encryption and spanish-jiddish speaking!
@Twitter Probably you don't even care that all the people who are following me have hacked accounts. Warning: Before you suspect me it wasn't me.
I hope you strongly work on privacy now before they have to invite @jack to Capitol Hill to give some statements how it was possible that a 19 year old hacker could gain telephonenumbers of German Bundestag Representatives! How Embarressing!
@Twitter Atleast I know now how all the telephone numbers of the German Politicians could get revealed to the public! Thank you, Twitter! And thank you for suspending my other account PaulTeske@SebbieKlemm!
@realDonaldTrump Great! my other twitter account PaulTeske@SebbieKlemm got suspended because of automatized tweet behavior! Probably that happens if I have to repeat over and over again how important Border Security is!
