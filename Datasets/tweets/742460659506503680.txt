@AuthorKimberley I agree.  I had heard the other day, not sure if it is the truth, haven't researched it , but WV was one of the states that had been hardest hit from this Pres.  I have health insurance too because of him.
@FoxNews @lisamurkowski She is country over party.  She stands proud .  All should be country over party, so Grassley admitted yesterday he didn't read it, " what he had been told, nothing came from it "
@TimOBrien Chief of Staff for 33 yrs.  That says a lot right there.  Sounds like your COS does a lot of work.  Is that who read the last FBI report for you ?
@TimOBrien I think in the near future that will change .  Just like someone read the FBI report and told him , there was nothing different in it.  As of yesterday's news conference , he had not read it
@washingtonpost @petridishes @BrettKavanaugh  said he was there as a son ,father, husband.  No he was there for a job interview.  No one in their right mind would hire him.  Can I get you a beer?

@adamcbest I would like for everyone to get back to country over party.  Not I'll get you back because you did this.  Is not worth the effort.  Put all of that where it can do some good.  I'm upset too, but it could turn around

@IvyEaves @MichaelAvenatti @SenatorCollins I believe the charges brought up.  If you don't how can you really vote for someone with that kinda of rage?  He is a Judge!!!  He couldn't keep it together and he lied about the drinking game , he just lied.  Did you, his response to all of it was NO
@SenatorCollins Country over party.  A no vote today and tomorrow
@mitchellreports @SenatorLeahy His way of dividing the country even more than it is.  Need to all vote in Nov see if we can turn things around .  Just Bret's attitude is enough to vote NO !

@realDonaldTrump Everyone in Congress and the other depts work for the American people.  I think enough have spoken out to say the majority don't want this man on the Supreme Court.  His out burst alone is enough to disqualify him.  Where was his  judicial temperament ?

@mjfree @realDonaldTrump Just his outburst from the beginning of his opening statement was enough to disqualify him.   He was a Judge when he said all of that.  Was not Judge material.  Should be disbarred
@jawnfreaks What if they don't appreciate it?  What then.  This has nothing to do with the politics going on right now.  Within my family .  Just keep wanting more and more, even when you tell them you can't do this much longer.

@jeremycyoung If you never attempted to assault or rape, or grope someone.  I don't think you will be accused, because you pattern in life will prove it.  Brets pattern proves it

@ellievan65 The ACA needed some work, but most of it was good.  Preexisting conditions,no caps. The only thing I didn't like was the fine if you couldn't afford it, . No one should be fined because they are only over a little to qualify for free, but doesn't make enough to buy

@evans7007 @ZerlinaMaxwell If they find something while investigating, do they just stop?  I would hope not.  Hope they talk to someone that tells all.  Then what?  Wouldn't they have to continue?

@lindeeloo_who Isn't supreme court cases, one's that are being challenged?  How has he been a judge for so long? I believe he was coming off of being drunk, probably downed a beer or 2 before, remember he didn't have to be there early.  Been there seen this

@olgaNYC1211 @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski I would think if the FBI finds something they would have to investigate it.  I'm not sure would need to do some research.  Even if it is outside scope limits.  I would hope so !!
@DLPTony @krassenstein How could anyone, and I know a lot still do, support him after seeing his actions? So many comment and have no clue as to what is really going on.  On a thread I read earlier, people were still saying she wouldn't be sworn in.  Where have they been the last 3 days?

@DLPTony @krassenstein They should look into his current position .  I believe if the investigations finds anything, he will no longer be a judge.  I still can't get over him talking back to some of them.
@krassenstein He should have demanded to do the same as Dr. Ford, would have made an even playing field.  After his out burst, even if he is innocent.  I don't believe he should be a Supreme Court Judge .  His action were unbelievable.  Shouldn't even be considered now

@kristine_kenyon @riotwomennn I stated my reason for voting how I did.  What is your reason ?
@kristine_kenyon @riotwomennn Why??????
@kristine_kenyon @riotwomennn No.  If it is then they are all misleading polls  .  We need women in these positions.
The detective wanted to talk to you.  Go talk to him.  You don't have to anything but talk .  You know it happened and so does the detective.  He has a history that you can add to .  You can stop it !!
I still hope anyone that has been sexually assaulted in the past yr files a police report.  I lost a couple of followers the last time I posted this.  Start a trail.  I am aiming this at one person.  He already had a trail.  Follow up .  Please report . Sa

@cspan @SenateMajLdr Do what you did to Anita.  If not she deserves a new hearing
@mitchellvii He will just be impeached.  Then what ????
@AndyOstroy Same men who questioned Anita.  "Are you a scorned woman"  Like it was her fault
Everyone just vote https://t.co/l4xKWXLYPP
@shannoncoulter Why?
@AynRandPaulRyan #WhyIDidntReport  Went with some friends house to drink that was all.  I drank, went outside to a car to sleep, woke up to someone trying to pull down my pants.  I was drinking, I thought that was what we were doing, no sex was ever mentioned
@JanelleRettig Oh No they have brought in a Female to do the questioning.  I want them to do the questioning.  "Are you a scorned woman"  Like they did Anita
@ABCPolitics McConnell needs voted out
@riotwomennn They all need voted out , and women need to take their jobs, not just bring in females when it seems right.  Would like to hear why so many voted the other way
@riotwomennn I voted no, because of the Anita Hill hearings.  I want every American to see what kind of questions those Old Men Ask. " Are you a scorned woman "   They made it sound like it was her fault.  They will do the same again.  It is a new day
@SaysHummingbird You are joking right ?
@bennydiego Yes it matters
@jonfavs Some of us once went to a friends house to drink, that was all.  I drank went outside passed out in a car.  Woke up to someone trying to pull my pants down .  Didn't report it.  Why ?  I would have been believed . #WhyIDidntReport
@andrewslack @Advancedape2E Really made me laugh out loud !!

@BrettKavanaugh no wiggle room when you said, " you didn't drink or have sex in High School or for several yrs after ".  Just hard to believe

@mkraju I thought Trump thought the New York Times was fake news.  So this is fake news, why is he bothering with it ?
@lrmorellana @blueinmo @SenateMajLdr @ChuckGrassley @LindseyGrahamSC @OrrinHatch Don't want to make the same mistakes twice.  I think they need to do a impeachment of Clarence and have that hearing again , with a female to do the questioning
@TheBeatWithAri @SenWhitehouse I would rather they bring in female Senators to do the questioning.  We are all ready paying them.  I believe they would do a good job, both Rep. and Dem to do the questioning

I was watching it too.  Unbelievable .  November can't come soon enough.  He knows Kavanaugh lied.  If he is confirmed, he will be impeaches after Nov.  Might be too late then .  The are looking at a law about double jeopardy now, have to make that one stay on the books https://t.co/UImGfSQ50h

@SenatorDurbin Others need to come and testify. One thing I'm really having a hard time with, is that so many were there some 20 + years ago and did the questioning, why are they still there?  I want those same Senators to ask the questions. See if they have become any wiser
@SenatorDurbin I would like to watch the Anita Hill, Clearance Thompson hearing.  Not sure where to find it.  If you have a link.  I would like to have it .  I hear they have an outside woman to ask the questions.  I want to hear from the elected officials.  "Are you a scorned woman"?
@ifudontlike2bad Some of them have been there for 50 yrs.  that was ongoing then and was really looked at very different, a slap on the back for the man.  Will only take a few, I'm sure some do have the proof that is needed.  They're scared for their lives and their families
@ifudontlike2bad I was thinking about this earlier. How many have been looked over because of weight , height, skin color? Too many. I wish for every women that has a sexual assault incident in Washington to come and speak it now.  I feel like alot of them are guilty. U can be protected
@JuddLegum He needs to go, voted out, or just retire, you are no good for our country

@ChocaholicBrit @bex716 @realDonaldTrump How much work could be done in Puerto with the money that is going to be used for a parade ?
@Blankednamer @Melanieswombats @cmconcepts @adamcbest @realDonaldTrump I'm sure he doesn't, but lets keep it real.  You can not cut back on permits and regulations to keep things safe.  Like the EPA, building bridges.  I don't know what that falls under.  What the burning of coal does to our environment, pipe lines the leak into our water
@rlbmcb14 @cmconcepts @adamcbest @realDonaldTrump I agree.  Run along now and go play !!!
@MorningJournal @realDonaldTrump Now he is trying to do away with all of the permits, red tape. to make these buildings go up faster.  I say let's keep the red tape, permits. to make sure they are all safe
@cmconcepts @rlbmcb14 @adamcbest @realDonaldTrump Do you ?

@cmconcepts @barmyarmycanuck @adamcbest @realDonaldTrump Never know with this pos in office
@cmconcepts @LaviniaHilltopp @adamcbest @realDonaldTrump Doesn't he always use the cheapest labor, then doesn't pay them ?
@cmconcepts @barmyarmycanuck @adamcbest @realDonaldTrump Will have to do more research, but building permits do make sure that fires and such don't spread.  Is that one that is being done away with ?
@LaviniaHilltopp @cmconcepts @adamcbest @realDonaldTrump He has no mind left to think with
@realDonaldTrump Yet you are rolling back on permits.  If it wasn't for all of the permits you had to get.  The out come would have been so much worse
@realDonaldTrump Same reason you haven't showed your tax returns  If you don't  providing them I will keep thinking you are hiding something  I really think you are, , what is the deal then Public figure, all your taxes should be public too I'm sure you could get mine but I have nothing to hide
@cmconcepts @adamcbest @realDonaldTrump Yet he is doing away with all of the permits.  HUMMMMMMMMMMM
