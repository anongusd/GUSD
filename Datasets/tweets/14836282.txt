Furthermore, @POTUS‚Äôs national emergency is well within precedent set by recent Presidents. Since 1979 National Emergencies Act has been used 31 times, including Clinton using it to fight drug traffickers and Obama using it to fight transnational gangs. Where was outrage then?
Dems resolution only terminates border security national emergency but does nothing to rein in national emergency authorities. This is a political pot shot pure &amp; simple. Many of us would support efforts to reform executive national emergency authority but this DOES NOT do that. https://t.co/cBecBoeDJH
If the ‚Äústick it to the President‚Äù crowd was serious about reining in executive authority they‚Äôd do it by putting a bill on House floor to reform national emergency authorities, not what Dems are pushing today that concedes POTUS is acting within his constitutional authority.
