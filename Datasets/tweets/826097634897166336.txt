@RepValDemings Thank you for thinking of ALL Americans. Thank you for listening to your constituents. #KeepACA

@RepAbraham You won your office because of those who voted for you. Do you know what they are saying today about healthcare? #KeepACA
@realDonaldTrump Okay, seriously. Who took over your Twitter for this tweet? This is a really complex sentence for you.
@RepKevinBrady You are elected to represent your constituents. Are you listening to their voices on #KeepACA?
@RepShimkus Are you listening to your constituents? #KeepACA
RT @RepDanKildee: RT if you oppose #Trumpcare https://t.co/tFKk34whzn
@RepThomasMassie Excellent point. Thank you for representing the people who voted for you -- and their wishes.
@SpeakerRyan Problem is, Americans do not want you to uphold this promise. You proceed &amp; you are going against what Americans want.
@RearickDianne Agreed on all points! It's just that I don't believe that #45 would think this is a win, to leave it in place.

@JohnCornyn @dcexaminer Guess you forgot you &amp; Repubs effectively filibustered Merrick Garland for 11 months. Remember that?
@ChuckGrassley Do you, yourself, have "a command of the law, independent voice and deep sense of humility?" Just sayin'.
@ChuckGrassley Hey, effectively you filibustered Merrick Garland for 11 long months. Remember that?
@SenatorLankford Extreme idea? Try tabling the nomination of Merrick Garland for 11 months. Have you forgotten those shenanigans already?
@SpeakerRyan So? If I don't have health ins, but have a HSA with $1K in it &amp; my hospital stay costs $40K, how does my HSA help me again?
For those who prefer visuals, it's still clear that repealing ACA is a disaster! https://t.co/QvDu4b383U
@SpeakerRyan Remember, around 24 million good people get hurt when you repeal ACA. #KeepACA
@SenateMajLdr Dems will show you fair consideration and "coming together" just like you &amp; Repubs did with Merrick Garland. How's it feel?
@SenateMajLdr Yes, all those uninsured can just go in corner and die; now fill out just one piece of paper: a death certificate.
@RonWyden The so called "death panels" have finally arrived in the form of budget cuts and rollbacks. #KeepACA &amp; #SaveMedicaid

@RepTedDeutch @StBaldricks Pls stand up against #TrumpCuts which take $5B/20% from NIH which cuts critical research and clinical trials.
@VP @POTUS And, takes away from life-saving, important disease research by cutting NIH by $5B/20%?
@SpeakerRyan @POTUS Is he going to build another wall around those with pre-existing conditions to keep them safe?
@SpeakerRyan @POTUS Do you realize that #workingAmericans are govt workers all around you in DC? Guess you don't ride Metro or get out much.
@SpeakerRyan @POTUS You welcome more deaths by cutting #LIHEAP which helps keep people warm at home in the winter. #TrumpCuts
@SpeakerRyan @POTUS I guess you welcome more deaths with a $5B/20% cut to NIH which halts clinical trials and disease research.
@SenateMajLdr If by "relief" you mean "more deaths" when you repeal the #ACA, yup, you're definitely spot on. Keep #ACA.
@housebudgetGOP @RepJasonLewis Are you listening to the huge, tremenous number of Americans who want to keep #ACA?
@housebudgetGOP @RepJasonLewis "Access" is not the same as "coverage". Keep #ACA.
@RepByrne @POTUS Let's just hope that you see the light and reject this "proposal."
@JasonKander @sethmoulton You're confusing them with a math word problem! Please keep the #ACA.
@RepDWStweets @realDonaldTrump Please stand up for your constituents who are America's working people and reject this budget.
@RepByrne Let's hope to sweet, merciful God that you see the light and reject this "proposal."
@sethmoulton Sadly, a majority of your constituents (and the US) feel we're living in an alternate universe right now....
@RepRoKhanna Thank you for stating the truth.
@SenTomCotton I think you forgot the "un" in front of "impressive."
@RepDianeBlack @housebudgetGOP Are you listening to your constituents who want to keep #ACA?
@RepRWilliams Working families include govt workforce in the DC area that are in line to be cut with the new #budget. Remember that.
@nikiinthehouse Thank you for standing up for your constituents!
@RepDianaDeGette @NIH Thank you for standing up for NIH's vital research budget. Their scientific advances save lives!
Fewer clinical trials + stopped research = more deaths. https://t.co/oUqZHcXLlC
@jasoninthehouse Are you kidding? #TBT fluff in the midst of massive #TrumpCuts. Get your priorities straight!
@RepBarbaraLee Thank you for listening to your constituents!
@senrobportman How do you feel about cutting $5B or almost 20% from NIH which will halt scientific research to cure diseases?
@SenatorCarper Thank you for listening to your constituents! #NoBanNoWall
@SenatorMenendez @awprokop Please listen to your constituents - don't cut Medicaid!
@repjoecrowley Thank you for standing up and representing your constituents!
@SenBennetCO @POTUS Thank you for standing up for your constituents -- working Americans!
@RepRaskin Thank you for standing up for your constituents -- the workers of America!
@RepRaskin @NIH Thank you for standing up for NIH. Cutting $5B from their budget means more deaths, fewer clinical trials.
@repjoecrowley Thank you for standing up for your constituents -- working families &amp; the poor!
#DeathPanels in new #budget: kill off poor &amp; homeless by abolishing Community Development Block Grant program.
#DeathPanels in new #budget: Cutting close to 20% of NIH funding means fewer clinical trials &amp; more deaths from disease.
#DeathPanels are a default in new #budget: cutting LIHEAP (which helps heat the homes of lower income people) will result in winter deaths.
@RepAndyHarrisMD @FoxBusiness @cvpayne Will you be discussing how your constituents feel about #ACA?
@RandPaul @RepMarkMeadows @fxnopinion Excellent plan. While you debate, all of Congress goes without any health insurance. Deal?

@SenWhitehouse It's a bigly job too.
@SpeakerRyan @POTUS I think 200 words is a stretch. More like 9 bullet points accented by lots of "huge, very, big, great, sad, scary."
@SenateMajLdr Thanks to you &amp; your inability to COMPROMISE, the past 8 years have not been easy for the American middle class.
@Rep_DevinNunes You are not a patriot, but a COWARD. Sad you don't listen to your constituents demanding a Trump-Russia investigation.
@KenCalvert I think you're eager because you mean "work together" = "talk over all our constituents" and "American" = "Republican"
@SenatorLankford We won't need physician-assisted suicide; if we don't have #ACA those w/o ins &amp; healthcare can go in corner &amp; die quietly.
@SenBlumenthal Thank you for listening to your constituents in person and remembering who elected you.
@SenCoryGardner Telephone townhalls are not discussions. And, at 10am? Really?

@SenJoniErnst And, hopefully they discussed with you the need to not kick people off health insurance after they hit a maximum $ limit. #ACA
@SenJoniErnst Hopefully they discussed with you the need to keep the protections for people with pre-existing conditions in the #ACA.

@SenatorLankford How much constituent feedback did you and your colleagues get in 2009? News travels fast on social media these days.
@SenTedCruz @BetsyDeVos I've cracked your code! You mean dismantle Dept of Ed. Just say it so everyone knows exactly what your agenda is.
@JohnCornyn Pushing nominees through isn't what it's about. Your job is to listen to your constituents and vote their wishes. Are you?
@SenatorLankford Opposing Senators take into consideration their constituents' views, you know, those who they are elected to represent.
@POTUS Senate Dems are supporting what their constituents say. Are the Senate Repubs listening to their constituents? #VoteNoDevos
@BraddJaffy @brianschatz See this site on lives of wolves &amp; just sub in admin names. It makes for amusing reading. https://t.co/tmjW2gvlhH

@SenatorTimScott You friends are listening to their constituents, hence their absence. Are you listening to your constituents?

@RepMarkTakano I do believe that consideration should last at least 341 days, the same length from Feb. 14, 2016 to Jan. 19, 2017.
"And freedom is special and rare. It's fragile; it needs protection." Pres. Reagan 1/11/89 I hope that the @GOP + @POTUS rereads this. (3/3)
"We've got to do a better job of getting across that America is freedom-freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of enterprise."(2/3)
On what would be Pres. Reagan's 106th birthday, I think it's important to revisit a quote from his farewell address on 1/11/1989. (1/3)
@SenCapito Support for #STARAct is huge. Thank you! Pls work to pass it, but even more important is the work to FUND it w/upcoming budget!

@SenAlexander #Newmath can be confusing, but this is clear: DeVos + Secretary of Education = Disaster! #voteno #unqualified #nodevos
@SenAlexander Valid reason? She's unqualified and has no clue about anything related to public education in the US.
@SenJohnThune Sit tight. It should take around 341 days, the same time period between 2/14/16 and 1/19/17.
@SenJohnThune #Newmath can be confusing, but this is clear: DeVos + Secretary of Education = Disaster! #voteno #unqualified #nodevos
