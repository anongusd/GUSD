@brandonmcg Hi, Brandon. I quoted some of your tweets in a story I wrote for Slate about the homily in Michigan. Thought you might be interested: https://t.co/sKs5CGdW86
@elliepses I was just talking with someone this weekend whose parish priest wouldn't baptize his son because he--the dad--had been divorced. He took the child one parish over, and had no problems, but the experience prompted him to leave the church.
@elliepses Thank you! Apparently the shift came w/ Vatican II in the 60s (https://t.co/zAgaCthtH4), but my sense is that the approach varies widely by diocese and even parish, as it does with so many issues.

Sounds like the change is mostly about bringing a popular "underground" club for LGBTQ students under the school's formal wing. This is a confusing compromise, but it suggests one way that conservative Christian schools are grappling with rising numbers of openly gay students.

@fitzcamel Fair argument! I'm glad to have read the piece, but others can disagree. I found it unflattering and illuminating (their grudges, their habits, the stories they tell themselves).
I feel like so many interesting magazine pieces are now greeted with outrage that the writer didn't litter the piece with blazing announcements of her own disapproval. The reason you are creeped out by many of the details in this piece is because Merkin included those details!
@elongreen Not saying the piece is perfect, but I'm happy to have read it. It's illuminating of their relationship dynamic, their motivations, their obsessions. I do not think it's flattering!
@elongreen Yes, fair, I'm seeing that, too. But again, she tells us when Allen is present. The reason we find it creepy is that she tells us when it's happening. Does she have to say, "By the way, this is creepy"?
The reason we know about the friendship and can analyze how it affects the piece *is because the writer and the magazine disclosed it.* This is exactly how it's supposed to work. You're not discovering a hidden bias!
This take, argh! This is precisely why Merkin got the interview that no one else has been able to get for all these years. It's not like the magazine clumsily assigned this to the wrong person. https://t.co/bCsiHVr8iu

Religious schools have a right to select students who share a set of core beliefs. But should the boundaries be set as strictly for online classes, where students miss out on many of the privileges of campus community? As Campbell put it, ‚ÄúThey weren‚Äôt even going to see me.‚Äù
He signed up to take two online classes at Clarks Summit to finish his degree. In late August, the school found out he was gay (how?) and told him he was no longer welcome. He has $30k in loan debt &amp; many of his credits won‚Äôt transfer to other schools.
He never graduated. Joined the Navy, became an alcoholic, got kicked out, got sober. Realized he was just six credits shy of graduating from the Bible college, now rebranded as Clarks Summit University.

In one week we've gotten: 1) White House flag zipping up and down in coded disrespect for McCain 2) hilarious Neil Armstrong biopic flag controversy and 3) people burning their own shoes over a flag-related Nike ad campaign. GOOD FLAG WEEK, everyone.

@Tish_H_Warren My childhood church has always been pretty politically diverse, and my understanding is that Facebook has made that more complicated to maintain peacefully. Curious if that's your experience.
@chilljat I attend a church that I'm quite certain is made up of 95% progressives. In my opinion, that has its own problems, but just to say there are churches out there for pretty much any political persuasion.
I'm late on this, but it's pretty remarkable: "More than half (57%) of Protestant churchgoers under 50 say they prefer to go to church with people who share their political views." Only a third of those age 65+ agree. https://t.co/k7VnvRRcbo

SBC president JD Greear has issued a statement about his attendance at the White House dinner for evangelicals last night, describing it as out of his comfort zone. He says he did not sign the Bible that Paula White presented to Trump. https://t.co/f7plLxXIxs
@andrewtwalk Agree. I haven't finished the New Yorker piece but it does get into that in a passage on @KSPrior and Liberty.
Here's Greear quoted in the New Yorker story about millennial evangelicals that just came out today. https://t.co/8mempqYUK4 https://t.co/hMynnUxwhu

Via @sarahmccammon, last night Paula White presented Trump with a Bible signed by 100+ evangelicals, with an inscription including the line, "History will record the greatness that you have brought for generations." Crowd at the White House was asked to say "Amen" to that. https://t.co/T40GyNTFN5
