Unlikely that Dems will pose a real threat to the open Senate seat. Expect a wide open GOP field.

Last cycle for DeBerg & Goddard? Both need to retire. Double digits yet slants the headline.Time for Jim Haynes to take helm at Rocky Mtn.
We're all a twitter waiting for Goddard's release "He's Only Down by 16 Statewide!"  Those ads really are working!
Why does AZ celebrate leadership by turning to a retired CNN anchor to discuss public life?  Why not let the winners speak?
Apparently, Goddard measures success by how badly he "thinks" he is being beaten. That is executive leadership you can trust!

Interesting that Dean Martin doesn't want to return illegal alien prisoners to Mexico and would rather pay for them to be on chain gangs.
Never told Dean Martin not to run.  Just warned him that his record would not stand up to his rhetoric if he decided to go through with it.
@arizonaguardian Thanks for the shoutout!  Next time, give @azhighground some attention.
