@Licatacs I think implications of attack on dissent far broader and profound.
@snjacobs agree with that.
@bradenking the mission was to chill dissent. That will have far longer and greater impact than fraud settlement.
@Licatacs chilling dissent is the direction.
@snjacobs the ability of citizens to criticize their leaders is the most essential freedom we have. So yes, it's a big deal.
