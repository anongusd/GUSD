Check out @NIJC's full report on how the Trump Administration manipulates and lies about data to perpetuate anti-immigrant policies:	 https://t.co/rx9sG6vhuM #DefundHate https://t.co/GZdteyI8M7
When they present statistics for immigrants with convictions, ICE &amp; CBP do not mention immigration-related offenses rank in the top categories of underlying criminal conduct. What the statistics really show is a federal  agency obsessed w/ punishing people for crossing the border
ICE routinely touts high percentage of immigration-related criminal arrests &amp; deportations that involve immigrants who enter outside port of entry, yet these statistics reveal that the administration is cooking the books by intentionally creating more migration-related offenses.
The administration utilizes the statistics resulting from zero-tolerance policies to conflate notions of criminality &amp; immigration status in its policy &amp; rhetoric. https://t.co/rx9sG6vhuM
Trump admin literally created own crime statistics by making it impossible for asylum seekers to present lawfully at ports &amp; then choosing to prosecute people for crossing border elsewhere to request protection. After zero-tolerance, prosecutions along border increased 30%.
3. Trump admin increased prosecutions of migration-related offenses &amp; now use increased convictions to demonize immigrants. https://t.co/rx9sG6vhuM
Distorting representation &amp; appearance rates in immigration court is particularly harmful b/c deck is already stacked against immigrants. Representation is critical due process safeguard in immigration court b/c people face life-altering consequences&amp; need an expert by their side
Yet high level officials blatantly misrepresented court appearance data in a recent Congressional hearing &amp; Trump himself has made unsubstantiated claims that immigrants ‚Äúnever show up [to court], it‚Äôs like a level of 3 percent. They never show up for the trial.‚Äù
DOJ's own data shows 60%+ of immigrant families in deportation proceedings appear for hearings &amp; rockets up to 98% percent when families have lawyers to help them understand the process. For unaccompanied children, 67.6% overall &amp; 95%+ with lawyers appear. https://t.co/QzQC0ZriRD
2. Trump admin lies about the percentage of immigrants who don't show up in court &amp; downplays crucial importance of legal representation in court hearings, especially for children. 	https://t.co/rx9sG6vhuM
The fault in Trump's logic is so simple it‚Äôs easy to miss: Trump made it nearly impossible for even the most bona fide refugee to obtain asylum &amp; now claims that applicants‚Äô failures to win protection proves they filed applications for nefarious reasons. https://t.co/rx9sG6vhuM
1. Trump admin blocked many people from getting asylum &amp; now tout low grant rates as evidence that most asylum claims are not legitimate. Harsh policies shut off asylum protections for many &amp; so under Trump denial rates for asylum applicants rose from 54.6% in FY16 to 65% in FY18
As Congress negotiates funding for @DHSgov, it's critical to know that the Trump administration regularly manipulates &amp; lies about data to justify harsh immigration policies and more funding for detention and deportation.

Congress must:	-Oversee &amp; hold @DHS accountable for corrupt&amp; abusive detention &amp; enforcement	-Cut immigration detention&amp; enforcement spending	-Amend next DHS spending bill to prevent @ICEgov from raiding other accounts to compensate for overspending #DefundHate #TrumpShutdown 16/
Congress‚Äô obligation to hold Trump accountable for respecting human rights goes beyond rejecting his wall. Congress must use spending powers to stop harm caused by @DHSgov &amp; @ICEgov's abusive &amp; unnecessary immigration jails. https://t.co/NTmq9AmGir #DefundHate #TrumpShutdown 15/
Don't forget that private prison corporations &amp; its investors make huge profit from jailing immigrants. To them, more immigrants = more $$$. To us, this all stinks of corruption. https://t.co/uCWh8Z4pGq #DefundHate #TrumpShutdown 14/
Grave human suffering results from every dollar spent on immigration jails. One asylum seeker told NIJC staff, ‚ÄúI actually thought I was going to die there,‚Äù after she spent 5 months in immigration jail. https://t.co/vs9hsRl7eJ #DefundHate #TrumpShutdown 13/
Immigration enforcement in the U.S. has crept steadily outside of the confines of democracy: if the White House cannot get what it wants from Congress, it will find another way, often out of sight of taxpayers and voters. https://t.co/vs9hsRl7eJ #DefundHate #TrumpShutdown 12/
.@ICEgov knows this will work because it has many times successfully manipulated Congress and the appropriations process to fill its coffers and lock up more and more immigrants. https://t.co/AH7ORdkzt9 #DefundHate #TrumpShutdown 11/
For 2019 Trump is demanding funding to jail a jaw-dropping 52,000 immigrants. Congressional appropriators repeatedly refuse this, so @ICEgov is going it alone, overspending &amp; expecting Congress to eventually cover its debt. https://t.co/vs9hsRl7eJ #DefundHate #TrumpShutdown 10/
This is an end-run around Congress similar to the president‚Äôs threat to invoke his emergency powers to unilaterally decide how to fund construction for a massive border wall Congress does not support.  https://t.co/vs9hsRl7eJ #DefundHate #TrumpShutdown 9/
Such brazen overspending during a shutdown has raised questions of legality under the Anti-Deficiency Act, the federal law prohibiting federal agencies from obligating funds not properly appropriated by Congress. https://t.co/vs9hsRl7eJ #DefundHate #TrumpShutdown 8/
A daily population of 48,000 in @ICEgov custody equals, over the course of one year, more than 400,000 people deprived of liberty inside ICE‚Äôs abusive, deadly, &amp; secretive immigration jail system. https://t.co/vs9hsRl7eJ #DefundHate #TrumpShutdown 7/
The 48,000 people jailed today represent a nearly 40% GROWTH of the immigration jail system from 2016. https://t.co/vs9hsRl7eJ #DefundHate #TrumpShutdown 6/
Since Trump‚Äôs inauguration, @DHSgov has managed to achieve an approximately $1 BILLION budget increase for @ICEgov to lock up and deport our immigrant neighbors. https://t.co/vs9hsRl7eJ #DefundHate #TrumpShutdown 5/
.@ICEgov is massively overspending its budget by jailing about 7,500 more people each day than Congress has approved. https://t.co/vs9hsRl7eJ #DefundHate #TrumpShutdown 4/
In ONE MONTH, @ICEgov has expanded immigration detention by 7 percent. This happened during the government shutdown and since Congress past the last Continuing Resolution on Dec 7. https://t.co/vs9hsRl7eJ #DefundHate #TrumpShutdown 3/
