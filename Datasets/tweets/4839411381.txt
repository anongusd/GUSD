@IndivisibleTeam @HarryPotterMAGE To be fair to conservatives, we took our sweet ass time denounce aggressive anti Semitic leadership in the woman‚Äôs march. Maybe we should take the arrogance down a notch here and actually thank them - acknowledge their humanity - because we are all imperfect.

@dedicatemyvote @Yamiche @NABJ A question is not justification. It‚Äôs a question.
@kat__stafford What about all the other minority demographics?
@RepMaxineWaters Possibly it‚Äôs based on qualifications of their applicant pool given the diversity of their overall staff and their progressive policies. Things like this only insult folks who face actual discrimination. Also, why only focus on one minority demographic? What about everyone else?
@Yamiche @NABJ Trying to make CBS into an issue only insults people who actually face discrimination.
@Yamiche @NABJ CBS has black employees and POC across the spectrum. It‚Äôs also a private company with progressive policies. Black people are a minority - they will not always be equally represented at all times. That‚Äôs the nature of being part of a minority demographic.

@Ricki2008 @HieronymusMcG @BPRNed9er @ByCharlesKellom The American Atheist society was founded by crooks who stole millions from folks in the name of atheist causes - like fighting prayer in school etc. Seems like they had plenty of control over their members.
@SaraM5115 @MommaJacy @BPRNed9er @ByCharlesKellom No - because one is a cause and the other is a result of a cause. So no, in this context it‚Äôs not. Now if you‚Äôre writing a paper on the impact of men and partriachy on society - then you would include the religious institution. But if you‚Äôre assigning causation - it‚Äôs men.

@conjecturally @eric13345 @EshiSEA @MartinLClifford @myerscb @TheOnion Hi, my point is about ACTUAL poverty in the US. And thank you for the congratulations. Glad you learned something. You‚Äôre welcome.
@GeorgeRafael @myerscb @TheOnion Wow. Actually that data didn‚Äôt include my ward. My ward average income is btw 24-28k depending on what report you look at. Like I said, here we are probably cheaper than an apartment in NYC and we are five miles from the hill. That five miles changes a lot.
@GeorgeRafael @myerscb @TheOnion And I 100 percent agree that most of dc is waaaay too expensive.
@GeorgeRafael @myerscb @TheOnion It‚Äôs is between 42k and 125k depending on what part of DC. I live in ward 8 and we are the poorest neighborhood in dc. Home girl could definitely afford to live here this moment if she wanted. If she wants to live on the Hill proper, then yes she would be closer to the median.
@conjecturally @eric13345 @EshiSEA @MartinLClifford @myerscb @TheOnion This part of the 7th congressional district is only one of 805 counties in the US making 19k or less including Wheeler, Georgia at a whopping 8k median income. If you‚Äôre feeling the need to continue obsessively googling: try researching the prevalence of poverty in the US.
@conjecturally @eric13345 @EshiSEA @MartinLClifford @myerscb @TheOnion Englewood is part of the 7th Congressional district &amp; median income just rose to 19k. Congressman Davis still Says 17k in his speeches to this day. If you‚Äôre that butthurt about it, call his office &amp; complain to his staff.
