@rusty4272 @jmy9595 @DarrenJMeenan @BillBallouTG That's the rationale that keeps these guys from getting 100%. It started with if Babe dibdt get 100 no one should. Griffey is probably the best player I ever seen play and definitely deserved 100. I thought he would be the guy to stop this nonsense.
@rusty4272 @jmy9595 @DarrenJMeenan @BillBallouTG And if you don't think Mo is one of the greatest post season players ever, I don't know what game you're watching.

ABSOLUTE WEAPON. Greatest relief Pitcher of all time, one of the greatest postseason players all time.

Meanwhile Harold Baines is a HOF. Ridiculous. When you vote for HOF, you ask yourself ONE question. "is the player a HOF" that's it.
@rusty4272 @EvanRobertsWFAN @stevesomerswfan But he's THE relief pitcher. There is no reason not to vote for him.
@rusty4272 @DarrenJMeenan @BillBallouTG why not? He's the greatest ever at his position. Other players were deserving of 100%, but just because they didn't shouldn't prevent him. that's how the whole thing started. With the Babe. it would be fitting if THE closer, finished this nonsense.
@rusty4272 @EvanRobertsWFAN @stevesomerswfan These guys vote in too many people, and then the players that truly deserve it don't get votes, ridiculous. If you didn't vote for Griffey Jr. you should have your vote taken away.
@rusty4272 @EvanRobertsWFAN @stevesomerswfan Forget the numbers. The guy was an absolute weapon. Psychologically as well as physically. Managers managed the game knowing if they were down in the 9th it was over essentially turning it into an 8 inn game.

@rusty4272 @_dadler it's wins above replacement. It's a meaningless stat. You can't tell me how many more wins a player is worth. Too many variables go into winning a game. And if I pitched for the Mets, I'd be out for the season with turf toe or something stupid.
@rusty4272 @_dadler stupid stat. you can't tell me how many wins an individual player is worth. There are too many variables that lead to a win.
@rusty4272 @_dadler no, that's my point. How could he be worth 6 against a league avg, if he's not even worth 6 if I replaced him.
@_dadler shows how stupid a stat war is. his war is 6.2 but he has only 5 wins! So if I pitched for the Mets instead would they have won 5 less games or 6?

@EddiesLaundry @lindsaystweets @SethMacFarlane I bet that bakery is out of business within the next couple years.
@EddiesLaundry @lindsaystweets @SethMacFarlane I hate any law that is compelling you to do something. Other than those which are a matter of safety. If they really had trouble finding someone to make the cake the. I would say it's a legit problem but most bakeries would make it. This guys bakery's business is down 40%
@EddiesLaundry @lindsaystweets @SethMacFarlane While it may be happening, even the article calls them "fringe". And let me ask you, would you go to a doctor who believes that nonsense? I wouldn't let him treat me for a hangnail. I totally understand your point but I feel the precedent is more dangerous the other way.
@EddiesLaundry @lindsaystweets @SethMacFarlane No worries, Eddie. I don't take anything that happens on Twitter personally, lol.
@lindsaystweets @SethMacFarlane Freedom
@lindsaystweets @SethMacFarlane Because I believe it shouldn't matter. I believe a business owner has the right to turn down business from anyone for whatever reason they deem appropriate. Not the govt.
@lindsaystweets @SethMacFarlane Right but the precedent will have to do with participation in a ceremony that is antagonistic to religious beliefs from a small business owner. Very narrow scope.
@lindsaystweets @SethMacFarlane Almost Anytime the govt is forcing people to do something, I'm against it. No matter what "side" it's on.
@lindsaystweets @SethMacFarlane I don't think it's the same, but it doesn't matter to me. If you walk into my store and I don't like the way your dressed, I shouldn't have to serve you. The store owner doesn't need a reason. This is America. It's supposed to be a free Country.
@lindsaystweets @SethMacFarlane RIGHT! But its not discrimination. What about the Christian's rights? Is there a hierarchy of rights I could look up somewhere? What trumps what? Everyone's rights are just as important as everyone elses. What if it was a Muslim baker who refused?
@lindsaystweets @SethMacFarlane No it can't. Read the what the Supreme Court ruled. It has a very narrow scope. That's why it was 7-2. This case will allow for very few if any precedents.
@lindsaystweets @SethMacFarlane It's about Freedom. It's a out forcing someone to do something against their beliefs. I'm for Freedom. With a capital F. As long as you aren't hurting anyone you should be free. You still didn't answer the question either. Should he be forced to bake the cake?
@EddiesLaundry @lindsaystweets @SethMacFarlane No, they are ABSOLUTELY distinguishable. There are specific laws about discriminating for health care. No one is dying because they are being discriminated against for health care. This has nothing to do with it.
@lindsaystweets @SethMacFarlane Right. And those laws are in place. This isn't life or death. This decision has a very narrow scope. Essential services are not affected.
@lindsaystweets @SethMacFarlane If I want an African American baker to make a confederate flag cake, should they have to? Let's say I'm a civil war buff and I want to have a civil war party.
@lindsaystweets @SethMacFarlane There is a difference and the Supreme Court recognizes that and so does the law. You didn't answer my question.
@lindsaystweets @SethMacFarlane 1st off, pharma doesn't sell medicine to individuals. This analogy is ridiculous. This decision has nothing to do with medical or other essential services.
@lindsaystweets @Wokmaidog @SethMacFarlane What if I was a civil war enthusiast and I asked an African American baker to bake me a confederate flag cake. Should he have to?
@lindsaystweets @Wokmaidog @SethMacFarlane That's incorrect. These types of things are most definitely separated. Discrimination of Essential services such as health care are already heavily protected under current law. This decision does nothing to change that
@lindsaystweets @SethMacFarlane Again, where is that taking place? Hippocratic oath. We're not talking about medical services.when is the last time someone was refused medical services? I'm for Freedom. Freedom to love who you want, marry who you want and sell things to who you want as well.
@lindsaystweets @SethMacFarlane That bakery would be out of business in 3 months.
@lindsaystweets @SethMacFarlane They'll always be someone else happy to make money from their discarded customers. I would open a bakery on that same block and put a rainbow flag out in front!
@lindsaystweets @SethMacFarlane Those in the medical field are held to the Hippocratic oath. And even if they aren't. I would suspect that most companies that refuse business would likely go out of business. The free market will take care of them. The only color or creed that REALLY matters is green.
@SethMacFarlane Just go to another bakery. No business should be forced to sell goods or services. If he refuses enough sales he'll go out of business.

@rusty4272 Agree to disagree
@rusty4272 Didn't he punch Paxson in the mouth at halftime because he took a shot that Jordan didn't want him to take?  Comparing the 2 is stupid anyway, They're 2 diff types of players.

@incarceratedbob He handled Tanaka brilliantly today
@incarceratedbob I hear ya, and they definitely need to get better together. It's not all Gary. I would imagine it's pretty difficult catching a 100 mph fastball when you're expecting a different location or a different pitch altogether. I just don't like how it's become an vogue to bash Sanchez.
@incarceratedbob Posada wasn't great back there either in that department.
@incarceratedbob We don't get to October without him. Almost every single team would trade their catcher for him in a second. He's not perfect. He's getting better. He's got an all world arm, and he's the best hitting catcher in the game.
@incarceratedbob I started out going to take a pic and post every ball in the dirt that he bkocked or caught. Just to combat you guys with the negativity. Tanaka was in the dirt all day, @ElGarySanchez had no problems. I gave up after 2nd inn though.
@incarceratedbob he was set up low it was 101 over his head Who knows it was even supposed to be fastball! sick of the Sanchez bashing.I tweeted 5 pics of balls in the he blocked in 1st 2 inns Never gonna hear how he caught a great game by Tanaka right? All those splitters in the dirt, c'mon man!
@ElGarySanchez So sick of the Anti-Sanchez rhetoric. I've seen DRAMATIC improvement and no one notices. The other day he blocked like 15 in the dirt, no one says boo. 1st inning today he's 2 for 2 so far. Just about every team would trade their catcher for ours! https://t.co/mnP7wXRavo

@instinctnaturel @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @JerryBrownGov 2010 was a 38 yr low, that was ok though.
@instinctnaturel @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @JerryBrownGov In 2010, there were a little over 500,000 arrests at the border. 09-600,000 &amp; 08-almost 800,000. With that logic, Obama shoukdnt have done it either. I would argue that the steady drop is from the actions of all the presidents
@instinctnaturel @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @JerryBrownGov So tell me why it was ok when Obama did it, but not now.
@instinctnaturel @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @JerryBrownGov Ok. Still missed my point. I never said wether it's a good idea or not, only that's it's a NORMAL thing for a President to do.
@instinctnaturel @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @JerryBrownGov I didn't say he obliged. Just that a lot of Presidents and all the most recent ones have done the same exact thing. But when this guy does it, it's egregious and an abuse of power. I'm just pointing out it's business as usual.

@Raptor2u @bouncingbrick @MeetThePress @RandPaul Then you take a guy who then blocks you and insults you in the middle of my attempt at an intelligent conversation. We don't have to agree, but we all need to try to see the other person's point of view without vilifying  the other. I remember when it was ok to disagree.
@Raptor2u @bouncingbrick @MeetThePress @RandPaul I don't believe Haiti is a "shithole" because most of the pop is black. I don't know what the reason is. It's probably due to a corrupt government. Some of those Baltic states are "shitholes" too, they're mostly white. It has nothing to do with skin color to me at least.
@Raptor2u @bouncingbrick @MeetThePress @RandPaul I grew up in Queens, NY, one of the most diverse places in the world. I'm not a Republican, I'm an independent. I lean conservative and I voted for Obama last election. Now I'm a racist because I voted for Trump.
@Raptor2u @bouncingbrick @MeetThePress @RandPaul We can argue who gets to come here and how many. I won't pretend to know the right answer but the way we just throw the "racist" word around now is tiring to me. I can only truly speak for myself but I try to not be racist. I take everyone on an individual basis.
@Raptor2u @bouncingbrick @MeetThePress @RandPaul I also believe however that a big reason our country is great is the fact that we take the struggling people and give them a chance and they come here to work harder because they're even more appreciative of the opportunities that we may take for granted.
@Raptor2u @bouncingbrick @MeetThePress @RandPaul What I was saying wasn't necessarily MY opinion, just what I perceive Trumps opinion to be. I honestly think he wants the immigrants who come here to have skills, education, etc. Regardless of skin color. I agree to a certain extent.

@bouncingbrick @Raptor2u @MeetThePress @RandPaul When I hear these things, I honestly don't think of race right away. I think, "oh, he's saying he wants less immigrants that are poor and more that will be self sufficient." The percentage of people living in poverty is much higher in the shitholes vs Norway. Fact. Not racist.

@MMehtaNYDN COUSINS COUSINS COUSINS COUSINS
@bouncingbrick @Raptor2u @MeetThePress @RandPaul That says "african nations" not All. You're twisting and reaching not me. How can we truly judge this conversation on a couple phrases out of context. There are plenty of countries on the African continent that are shithole by the way.
@bouncingbrick @Raptor2u @MeetThePress @RandPaul I'll give you this though, he does kinda tap dance around those people a little though because they vote for him.
@bouncingbrick @Raptor2u @MeetThePress @RandPaul He didn't say the entire African continent was a shithole. We still don't know exactly what he said. He said not all of the people there were white supremacists and then said there was fine people on both sides. He has denounced white supremacists repeatedly.
@bouncingbrick @Raptor2u @MeetThePress @RandPaul Norway has one of the least poverty rates in the world, lower than ours too. That's why he wants Norweigian here not because they're white.
@bouncingbrick @Raptor2u @MeetThePress @RandPaul The poverty rate in Haiti is 58.6% vs. 7.5% in Norway. So if people emigrating from both countries I'd be willing to play the odds and,say the incoming Haitians are going to need more assistance then the Norwegians. That's not racist. That's math.
@bouncingbrick @Raptor2u @MeetThePress @RandPaul I honestly don't know. I don't have all the information in front of me.
@bouncingbrick @Raptor2u @MeetThePress @RandPaul That's nice. You don't even know me.
@bouncingbrick @Raptor2u @MeetThePress @RandPaul https://t.co/V0Nn97vC7o	According to this, 18% of Haitian immigrants coming in of age have college degree. I can't find the percentage of incoming Norweigian immigrants who have college degrees. And why do you feel the need to insult me? I have been nothing but respectful to you
@bouncingbrick @Raptor2u @MeetThePress @RandPaul Doesn't mean they're better people, just better off.
@bouncingbrick @Raptor2u @MeetThePress @RandPaul People in Norway are more educated and have more means and skills and bring more to the table than people in Haiti for the most part. That's not racist, that's a fact.
@bouncingbrick @Raptor2u @MeetThePress @RandPaul Personally I think the guy is an arrogant loudmouth. I think he is a horrible speaker. He's not good with words. But I really don't think he's racist.
@bouncingbrick @Raptor2u @MeetThePress @RandPaul What I take from the most recent one is this, someone from a "shithole" comes here and most likely we are going to have to take care of them. They're not bringing skills or a valuable trade with them.
@bouncingbrick @Raptor2u @MeetThePress @RandPaul We didn't hear the whole conversation in both of those cases. How do we know he wasn't being sarcastic in the black caucus meeting? Sounds like she mightve deserved some with her, not all are black comment.

I talk to people who are intelligent &amp; previously 100% rational and now sound like lunatics when they talk about him.
@IsThisThingOn31 @pieces833 @FoxNews @Varneyco I'm not a Republican or a Democrat. I voted for Obama last election. I dont just defend Trump all the time. In this particular instance I agree with the tweet. Will there be negative affects from his policies, Probably. Right now, market not 1 of them.
@IsThisThingOn31 @pieces833 @FoxNews @Varneyco I digress. Not deflecting just saying AGAIN, original tweet said stocks were up in no small part to Trumps policies. They are directly helping 401ks.
@IsThisThingOn31 @pieces833 @FoxNews @Varneyco Just proving a point, you brought up Obama 1st. Also not absurd I worked in the mortgage industry back then, deregulation of mortgages made it easier for people who couldn't afford to buy homes  led to increased foreclosures, not the only reason for it but one of them, but
@IsThisThingOn31 @pieces833 @FoxNews @Varneyco Or like the regulations that caused it that Clinton took away, like the mortgage crises? See I can do that too. Bottom line is stocks go up so do 401ks. That's all the orig tweet said and that's all I'm saying. I have a 401k, 457 &amp; some stocks, I'm also middle class.
@pieces833 @IsThisThingOn31 @FoxNews @Varneyco So, when corporations and companies traded on the stock market do well, their stock price doesn t go up? Who said anything about trickle down economics. 1 simple point that you guys keep dancing around. Business are more profitable, stock  prices go up, 401ks &amp; funds go up too.
@IsThisThingOn31 @pieces833 @FoxNews @Varneyco The regs he cut weren't even around after the great depression. A rising market rises because of many factors. Less taxes on corporations, means they make more profit, no? Less regs on businesses means more profit, no? More profit drives stock prices higher no?
@IsThisThingOn31 @pieces833 @FoxNews @Varneyco Lots of things could go wrong. It's amazing how tweets go off the rails. Look at the original tweet. Look at pieces response. All I am saying is in response to that. Nothing more, nothing less.

@pieces833 @FoxNews @Varneyco So, corporations are  making more money because of him. That doesn't drive stock market?
@pieces833 @FoxNews @Varneyco I said multiple times that the deregulation could very well have negative affects. But to the stock market and 401ks are directly related to each other.
@pieces833 @FoxNews @Varneyco I never said I don't give a shit about worker safety. The tweet was about Americans 401ks and pens funds doing well because of Trump. You said, he's done nothing for this. I am responding to that. We can have a discussion about the other stuff too if you'd like.
@pieces833 @FoxNews @Varneyco Which was my point. You said he's done nothing for this. Meaning the stock market.  While they may be bad for workers or the environment, different conversation, they are good for the market therefore benefiting said funds.
@pieces833 @FoxNews @Varneyco Call them what you want but some of thise Executive orders are repealing regulations. And while you may not like them or think they are a joke, if they allow business to be more profitable that is good for the stock market,  which is good for 401ks and pension funds tied to it.
@pieces833 @FoxNews @Varneyco And while consumers certainly drive the economy, they are not the only factors. Investors, corporations, commodities and speculation are o the major factors. De-regulation helps corporations and investors be bullish on the market which drives it up. The new tax law is a prime ex.
@pieces833 @FoxNews @Varneyco Here is a list up to Oct 13th. It's pretty long, but there are things in there like the Agricultural one and there are some environmental ones and wall street regs as well. Again, I'm not saying there won't be negatives, but  are positives to the economy.	https://t.co/PhduEprlai

@pieces833 @FoxNews @Varneyco https://t.co/XFPvWET4fw	This says 635 regulations were repealed, 244 were made inactive, and 700 were delayed. Now I'm not saying there may not be negative effects to it but the deregulation is definitely good for the economy. What they might hurt, I'm not sure admittedly.
@pieces833 @FoxNews @Varneyco So, the quotes by the executives saying the regs he is/will cut have their expectations up means nothing? That's how the stock market works, speculation. You may not like it but all the environmental regs he cut to make business easier to make money definitely helps economy

@FoxNews @KatiePavlich So Trump says nasty things about male politicians. He uses sane exact words about a female and it's sexual harassment. This is what Katie means. He's treating her like everyone else not softer cause she's a woman

@Karoli @Susann_Sayz @wendow @SybilT2 @AshleyRParker @AprilDRyan @PressSec Sad.
@Karoli @Susann_Sayz @wendow @SybilT2 @AshleyRParker @AprilDRyan @PressSec First off i didnt say you "ladies are just too harsh" dont quote me incorrectly. And yeah, block or mute someone with a different point of view. Only through honest discussion can we get to truly understand each other. That is what my motives are
@Susann_Sayz @wendow @SybilT2 @AshleyRParker @AprilDRyan @PressSec @Karoli Still not answering my question. He was calling her integrity out. My opinion. Let's say he only wanted to do that and not imply anything sexual. What should he have wrote?
@Susann_Sayz @wendow @SybilT2 @AshleyRParker @AprilDRyan @PressSec @Karoli Merry Christmas to you and yours as well.
@Susann_Sayz @wendow @SybilT2 @AshleyRParker @AprilDRyan @PressSec @Karoli I am not being obtuse. If I wanted to say a female politician would do anything for a campaign contribution, but nothing sexual just usual sleazy politician stuff, what should I say? I'm genuinely  confused with your opinion. Honest.
@Susann_Sayz @wendow @SybilT2 @AshleyRParker @AprilDRyan @PressSec @Karoli When he said the men would do anything for the same reasons was he implying they were prostitutes?
@Susann_Sayz @wendow @SybilT2 @AshleyRParker @AprilDRyan @PressSec @Karoli He did, he said begging for campaign contributions
@Susann_Sayz @wendow @SybilT2 @AshleyRParker @AprilDRyan @PressSec @Karoli I'm not being cute here, I genuinely would like to know.
@Susann_Sayz @wendow @SybilT2 @AshleyRParker @AprilDRyan @PressSec @Karoli So when he says the same exact words to men it's not? What words should he have used if he was just saying she's a money hungry politician like he said about the men?
@wendow @SybilT2 @Susann_Sayz @AshleyRParker @AprilDRyan @PressSec @Karoli Merry Christmas to you and your family also.
@wendow @SybilT2 @Susann_Sayz @AshleyRParker @AprilDRyan @PressSec @Karoli If you don't think that's how ALL politicians do business...
@wendow @SybilT2 @Susann_Sayz @AshleyRParker @AprilDRyan @PressSec @Karoli She in fact went to his office and he in fact gave her money.
@wendow @SybilT2 @Susann_Sayz @AshleyRParker @AprilDRyan @PressSec @Karoli And right, exactly. He wasn't suggesting Cruz gave him a BJ and wasn't suggesting she was either. Just talking about the sleaze of politicians who can be bought. Who knows more about them than the actual guy who bought them?
@wendow @SybilT2 @Susann_Sayz @AshleyRParker @AprilDRyan @PressSec @Karoli Begging was in quotes not do anything. Listen I'm not a huge fan of the guy either, I do think however that people are losing their minds picking apart everything he says and does in a way I've never seen before. That's what makes me want to defend him.
@wendow @SybilT2 @Susann_Sayz @AshleyRParker @AprilDRyan @PressSec @Karoli Same exact words. What words can you use to say she would do anything without it being sexual? Honest question

@blue_activist @DKStruckmann @kjfrn @SenSanders Like what? I don't want anything unnecessary to be paid for with public money
@blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders Many consider it murder. Is it? I don't know to be honest. But a lot of people do.
@blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders Because many probably half or more than the country believe it's immoral. If that many people feel that way, why put govt money into it?
@blue_activist @marsha415 @kjfrn @SenSanders You got to see the glasses my insurance let's me get for free! I would look like mr.magoo!
@blue_activist @KevinArdery @kjfrn @SenSanders We all need to be more uderstading of others opinions&amp;find compromise I dont want universal health care but if we must no unnecessary things
@blue_activist @DKStruckmann @kjfrn @SenSanders They're motivation is the same as every other business'...to make $. They don't care helping women or men for that matter
@blue_activist @DKStruckmann @kjfrn @SenSanders How's this, man who is proven to impregnate woman must pay for half of abortion costs incl transportation and any loss of salary
@blue_activist @DKStruckmann @kjfrn @SenSanders It's not about men or women. I don't want my tax dollars going to unnecessary medical procedures
@blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders No they should not be funded if they perform abortions.  Nor should any other that performs them.
@blue_activist @marsha415 @kjfrn @SenSanders Come on now If he can get glasses and see then I dont want to pay for Lasik. I'll pay for his glasses once a year...only the real cheap ones
@blue_activist @GaijinHakase @revolusha @Jake_Garey @angbrang @kjfrn @SenSanders Doesn't matter to me how many abortions there are. I don't want to pay for anything not necessary period.
@blue_activist @KevinArdery @kjfrn @SenSanders Doesn't work that way. That's why we elect people to make these decisions. Too bad they rarely do what we actually want!
@blue_activist @DKStruckmann @kjfrn @SenSanders I'm not sure I believe that story. Sounds ridiculous. If true, insurance company needs to change that.
@blue_activist @DKStruckmann @kjfrn @SenSanders That shouldn't be.
@blue_activist @DKStruckmann @kjfrn @SenSanders That's ridiculous.
@blue_activist @DKStruckmann @kjfrn @SenSanders Sure, life happens. But it's not the govt responsibility to help you out of every sticky situation you get into
@blue_activist @DKStruckmann @kjfrn @SenSanders Im ok with necessary life saving abortions being covered by public insurance.
@blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders As long as tax dollars arent goin towrds abortions or the places that perform them im good. Pub option ins should only cover necessary thngs
@marsha415 @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders I'm ok with covering it when medically necessary. As for the unsafe alts its not gov responsibility to keep people from making bad decisions
@marsha415 @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders Your taxes shouldn't pay for any of my med procedures. But if there is going to be a public option, it should only cover necessary ones.
@NRO @jimmykimmel @theodorekupfer I remember when jimmy Kimmel was a comedian. He was pretty funny.
RT @Michele_Tafoya: ‚ÄúGovernment is growing faster than the economy.  It ought to be the opposite.‚Äù  ‚Äî Sen. John Kennedy.
@matthewjdowd We can agree on that one!
@skateormtg @kjfrn @SenSanders I'm all for that
@DKStruckmann @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders I am more than willing to use my tax dollars for people in need. But only for what they NEED. also its none of my business if you want abort
@revolusha @Jake_Garey @angbrang @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders I believe churches should be taxed by the way
@revolusha @Jake_Garey @angbrang @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders I gotta get up early nice talking to you. Keep up the respectful give and take thats how we will come to compromise with ea other Goodnight
@revolusha @Jake_Garey @angbrang @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders I like that idea The woman should b able to sue male if refuses to pay DNA test on fetus proves it's his make him pay .5 + her legal fees.
@BrainBriefs @Jake_Garey @angbrang @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders I can agree to that
@revolusha @Jake_Garey @angbrang @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders Your not forced, it's not illegal. Just not free. I think that's reasonable. But that's just my opinion.
@revolusha @Jake_Garey @angbrang @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders In the end probably dont afect me. I c your point I hope I help u to see mine We don't have to agree, just know where other side coming from
@revolusha @Jake_Garey @angbrang @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders I get my health ins thru my job. And I have very good coverage by the way. My premiums went up, they blame aca,  but I think it's excuse
@revolusha @Jake_Garey @angbrang @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders Your opinion and your entitled to it You may even b right But right now it not fair to ask .5 the pop to pay for something they don't want
@revolusha @Jake_Garey @angbrang @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders I haven't gotten Lasik because it's expensive. I would love to get it. But just because I eantg something doesn't mean you should pay 4 it
@revolusha @Jake_Garey @angbrang @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders You don't NEED Lasik. That's the point. The public option should be what you NEED.
@revolusha @Jake_Garey @angbrang @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders Is it murder? I dont know but a  big portion of the country believe it is Should we respect their beliefs and leave it out of public ins?
@revolusha @Jake_Garey @angbrang @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders Then be more careful and don't get pregnant. And if you do, that's on you not the taxpayer Nevermind that a lot of people consider it murder
@kjfrn @TheNotoriousNME @SenSanders I don't believe in that either
@revolusha @Jake_Garey @angbrang @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders Again your opinion. I agree with you too in private ins, But A lot of people do not think those things should be covered by a public option
@revolusha @Jake_Garey @angbrang @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders Doesn't make it right
@revolusha @Jake_Garey @angbrang @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders Abortion, Lasik eye surgery, cosmetic surgery stuff like that.
@revolusha @Jake_Garey @angbrang @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders If we're gonna have a public ins option it shouldn't cover anything that's not necessary to the normal health of the individual.
@TheNotoriousNME @kjfrn @SenSanders It's not govt's responsibility to help people make correct personal choices. It's your own responsibility.
@TheNotoriousNME @kjfrn @SenSanders How about Lasik surgery? Boob job? Hair plugs? Sex change? Botox? A new car? I want a helicopter! My house?
@PapaDocStrunsee @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders No greed or spite. I dont want you to pay for anything that I want either.
@PapaDocStrunsee @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders No. It's none of my business what you want to do. Have an abortion, don't have one, who am I to judge. I just don't want to pay for it.
@revolusha @Jake_Garey @angbrang @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders And if you're goin to use public money you should at least have most of public in agreement on what it's being spent on
@revolusha @Jake_Garey @angbrang @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders You rather but a lot of people dont feel that way lot of people dont want their tax dollars goin to elective non life threatening procedures
@New0rleansLady @kjfrn @SenSanders ?
@revolusha @Jake_Garey @angbrang @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders If it's private insurance sure, but a lot of people don't think it's reasonable if the ins is subsidized by govt in any way.
@TeddyWKlein @angbrang @Jake_Garey @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders @PPact Take care pal, nice talking to you. Keep up the respectful dialogue and maybe others will do the same. Peace
@TeddyWKlein @angbrang @Jake_Garey @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders @PPact I know, but let's try. I think that's the compromise where everyone is happy. Can't we fund clinics that do all those things but aborts?
@TeddyWKlein @angbrang @Jake_Garey @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders @PPact Some say it is murder. Is it? I don't know, but I can see how they can say that. Murder goes beyond religious beliefs
@TeddyWKlein @angbrang @Jake_Garey @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders @PPact I don't care about the religious aspect Im against funding pp because I dont think gov however indirectly should fund elective med procedure
@TeddyWKlein @angbrang @Jake_Garey @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders @PPact I myself happen to be fine with that. It's a different convo though. I understand your point
@TeddyWKlein @angbrang @Jake_Garey @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders @PPact Why not be reasonable and keep gov away from anything that's controversial?
@TeddyWKlein @angbrang @Jake_Garey @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders @PPact It's deeper than religious. Like it or not at least half the country doesn't want pp funded because of abortion.
@TeddyWKlein @angbrang @Jake_Garey @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders @PPact If necessary, I'm fine with it.  But how we define necessary is another field of land mines
@TeddyWKlein @felixpeccatum @KevinMcKay15 @angbrang @Jake_Garey @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders @PPact You haven't Ted, many others have though
@TeddyWKlein @angbrang @Jake_Garey @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders @PPact Because abortion is against many peoples religion and not necessary and military might is seen as protecting us the citizens of the country.
@felixpeccatum @TeddyWKlein @KevinMcKay15 @angbrang @Jake_Garey @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders @PPact Not a genius, just trying to have a respectful discussion on a very touchy subject. I have been insulted many times unfortunately.
@StudioSpicy @kjfrn @SenSanders A lot of people don't see it that way. Gov money keeps the lights on pays salaries, etc. No abortions at all and fund the place, everyone: )
@revolusha @Jake_Garey @angbrang @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders You shouldn't pay for Viagra either. I'm against that as well. I'm not speaking technically, let's be reasonable.
@TeddyWKlein @angbrang @Jake_Garey @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders @PPact Come on now. Let's be reasonable. Abortion bothers a lot of people. Let's get people the help they need without the controversial service
@TheMalted1 @kjfrn @SenSanders If the govt hands me money to help me sell milk not buys the milk from me
@TeddyWKlein @KevinMcKay15 @angbrang @Jake_Garey @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders @PPact All im saying is since it's a controversial issue why not fund a diff org that also does the other things but not abortions
@elainelayabout @Jake_Garey @angbrang @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders Greed driven? Why do you have to insult me? Let's start one then. Let's make one exist. It's the answer to the problem.
@TeddyWKlein @angbrang @Jake_Garey @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders @PPact It's just semantics. Obviously abortion bothers a lot of people, find a different org to do those other things for people and everyone is :)
@elainelayabout @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders give $ to a different org to do those things in those areas. That's how we solve problem. Take out abortion and everyone is happy
@KevinMcKay15 @angbrang @TeddyWKlein @Jake_Garey @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders @PPact I do but gov is keeping lights on and indirectly funding it. Since its an issue for lots of people, why can t we fund a different place?
@elainelayabout @Jake_Garey @angbrang @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders Why can't we fund a place that does all the other stuff except abortions? Isn't that reasonable?
@elainelayabout @Jake_Garey @angbrang @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders We fund pp! 	Pp does abortions!	What part do you not grok?
@elainelayabout @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders No, let's fund a place that doesn't do abortions. Or pp can stop doing them. Very simple
@TheMalted1 @kjfrn @SenSanders So I open company that sells heroine &amp;  milk. The govt gives me money which I use to buy milk, I get money from Bob to buy heroin thats ok?
@angbrang @TeddyWKlein @Jake_Garey @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders @PPact You needed $8 total, I gave you half. Does it really matter where you spent the exact physical part of my money on?
@angbrang @TeddyWKlein @Jake_Garey @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders @PPact I give you $4, you buy cookies 	You take $4 from Joe and then go buy milk	I didn't help you buy milk?
@angbrang @TeddyWKlein @Jake_Garey @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders @PPact If i give you money and you use it for 1 thing, then you buy something else with "other" money, I'm still helping you buy the other thing
@Matt_Holck @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders Not sure what you mean
@d_g_runrunrun @Fnnogg @SenSanders You want to get rid of tax deductions for children?
@ztwx2015 @kjfrn @SenSanders How?
@TeddyWKlein @Jake_Garey @angbrang @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders Tax money goes to pp	Pp does abortion	Tax money goes to place that does abortion
@TeddyWKlein @kjfrn @SenSanders $ going to same place
@aurellink @VattimoMichael @angbrang @Jake_Garey @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders Ok, smart guy, let's change elective to procedure needed to ensure health of patient as recommended by Dr.
@Matt_Holck @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders No, we should only give the poor money for things they NEED
@Jake_Garey @angbrang @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders Missing the point. It's an ELECTIVE medical procedure. Taxpayers shouldn't have to pay for it.
@MolCZet @kjfrn @SenSanders $ all goes to same place. Stop doing abortions, and continue to get funded. Why should taxpayers even indirectly pay?
@angbrang @blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders Sorry for having a different opinion than you.
@RyanRuocco Was just saying basically same thing to my son
RT @HouseGOP: RT if you‚Äôd rather file taxes on something as simple as a postcard. https://t.co/VB1ZBnm3Yi
@docwindprod Who said that? Thats why they are trying to separate the abortions out.
@MolCZet @kjfrn @SenSanders If i give you a $20 bill and you use it for pizza and then go out and buy $20 worth of tacos. I helped you buy both not just one.
@docwindprod And that's the problem with gov Sponsored anything. If gov subsidizes the policy then in turn it's subsidizing the abortions
@blue_activist @kjfrn @SenSanders So what? I could care less how many abortions there are, as long as I don't have to pay for them
@kjfrn @SenSanders If i give you $6 and you buy water for $3, and put $3 of gas in your car. And then take your car to get milk. I helped you buy the milk.
@thankman360 @kjfrn @SenSanders Who doesn't believe what?
@d_g_runrunrun @Fnnogg @SenSanders There already is tax deductions for children and I'm all for taxes on churches
@akeleven And im only 41 and don't use Viagra lol. ;)
@akeleven I agreed that we shouldn't cover viagra. And i believe Maternity costs should be covered.
@kjfrn @SenSanders Id be for that as well!
@kjfrn @SenSanders Just because im k w/ it doesnt mean evryone is dont think we should force someone to pay for something conflicts their religious beliefs
@kjfrn @SenSanders Id say yes because less children that would otherwise be a drain on economy But to others it is against their religion and they dont approve
@kjfrn @SenSanders They do abortions	They get tax money	Equals tax money for abortions	How about not doing abortions there and continue to get tax money?
@kjfrn @SenSanders And they shouldn't be. So what is Bernie complaining about?
@Fnnogg @SenSanders Agreed
@kjfrn @SenSanders They're not taking away your choice. You can still do it, taxpayers shouldn't have to pay for it. I want a nose job, should you pay for it?
@SenSanders It's also legal to get a boob job. I don't wa t to pay for yours either. Taxpayers shouldn't have to pay for elective medical procedures.
@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn It would take him doing something racist. I don't think he's done anything racist. People throw that term around way too loosely these days
@JonFilmFan @pappyshalfpint1 @matthewjdowd @elpeezey Same here pal
@ike_salado_tx @matthewjdowd @JonFilmFan @elpeezey Oh, gotcha.
@unhipcat @matthewjdowd I will say 1 thing about this whole thread, everyone was respectful to each other. That gives me hope
@unhipcat @matthewjdowd Both sides of same coin Listen to each other try to find common ground We're all nevr going to agree on everything focus on what we agree on
@unhipcat @matthewjdowd We get so caught up arguing for "our" side we do t even hear the other person. Dowd makes his living off this they all want us arguing
@unhipcat @matthewjdowd Finally! Lol But it illustrates my point even further Today we take evrything and make it political Your arguing with me &amp; I probably agree
RT @forestservice: The Forest Service was founded by great conservationists, hunters, and anglers. Come #HuntShootFish with us on 9/23. htt‚Ä¶
@elpeezey @ike_salado_tx @matthewjdowd @JonFilmFan I'm not trying to justify anything. Only saying Dowds tweet took something not political and made it political.
@kumailn you guys r all talk Why didnt  leave  party? Too busy pattin each other on the back for enlightening us little people on how we should live!

@FriendOfTheYeti @JonFilmFan @matthewjdowd Agreed. Not my point, lol
@ike_salado_tx @matthewjdowd @JonFilmFan @elpeezey Not sure what the "we?" Is supposed to mean, but I agree with you. They're a private company that failed. They didn't adapt.
@AsyaPikovsky @matthewjdowd @JonFilmFan @elpeezey This is the problem  right now. Everyone on the offensive about every little thing. No need to start fires where there isn't one Dowd.
@AsyaPikovsky @matthewjdowd @JonFilmFan @elpeezey Good point I agree politically with almost all of you My point(for the 1000th time) Dowd taking a non political issue&amp;making it political
@matthewjdowd @JonFilmFan @elpeezey I took the point of your tweet as a jab at DT and to make something NOT political into something political.
@unhipcat @matthewjdowd No! My point was that Dowds tweet was taking something not political and making it political.
@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn Ok, I never said he wasn't a liar. I don't think he is a racist though.
@desertdudesCatC @elpeezey @matthewjdowd @JonFilmFan No, missing my point
@unhipcat @matthewjdowd Again ,  not disagreeing. You are all missing my point
@JonFilmFan @elpeezey @matthewjdowd Everybody always has to come at everything from a left or a right angle. Jeesh! It's exhausting
@JonFilmFan @elpeezey @matthewjdowd My whole point is STOP MAKING EVERYTHING POLITICAL. I most likely agree with all of you in regards to the coal industry,  but we're arguing
@JonFilmFan @elpeezey @matthewjdowd Dowds tweet is trying to make toysrus political, my whole point is that it's not.
@JonFilmFan @elpeezey @matthewjdowd No shit! That's the definition of political! Things politicians talk about!
@elpeezey @matthewjdowd @JonFilmFan Also, whole small rural towns were built around coal industry. I'm pretty sure there isn't a town built around a toysrus.
@elpeezey @matthewjdowd @JonFilmFan Agreed. Coal is political, toysrus not.
@sciam  https://t.co/uVYQpyQuFw
@sciam Doesn't that look just like that map of the universe...makes me wonder
@robneyer And by the way, I just read the speech. What do you need to apologize for? Sounded ok to me.
@unhipcat @matthewjdowd https://t.co/VMW3GRrj0P	Here's just one article about just one round of anti-coal regs
@matthewjdowd @Addisonjojo Again, that's fine. Not my point.
@michael_carlier @matthewjdowd I agree, you are all missing my point because your all so focused on DT! COAL WAS/IS A POLITICAL ISSUE! TOYSRUS ISNT!
@matthewjdowd @JonFilmFan I would agree with you, but my point is govt regs have played a role with coal. It has become a political issue. Toysrus is not
@matthewjdowd @JonFilmFan Your better that that Dowd
@matthewjdowd @JonFilmFan You sound like, "oh yeah Trump! There's a pothole on my street, what u gonna do about that huh?"
@matthewjdowd @JonFilmFan "The¬†Interior Department¬†estimates that it will cost the coal industry about $81 million each year to comply with the rule."
@matthewjdowd @JonFilmFan https://t.co/VMW3GRrj0P
@JonFilmFan @matthewjdowd Didn't say it was. Just that it was political.
@JonFilmFan @matthewjdowd Not everything is politics.
@JonFilmFan @matthewjdowd You have plenty of things to criticize POTUS about. This isn't one of them, your criticisms ring hollow when you try to blame EVERYTHING
@JonFilmFan @matthewjdowd Again, a political issue. Fit in with his theme of keeping American manufacturing here in America. Toysrus bankruptcy is not political.
@RealFriscoDisco @robneyer I do care about other people, I DON'T CARE about what other people THINK about me.
@SpiritofBen @matthewjdowd Again, not arguing if regs are wrong or right, just that they existed and was a factor in coals decline. Govt not a factor in toysrus case
@SpiritofBen @matthewjdowd "The¬†Interior Department¬†estimates that it will cost the coal industry about $81 million each year to comply with the rule."
@SpiritofBen @matthewjdowd https://t.co/VMW3GRrj0P
@JonFilmFan @matthewjdowd Ok so even if only a little the govt was  involved with coals demise, govt zero involved with toyrus. That all. Pres shouldn't b involved
@robneyer Interacting is one thing, apologizing and worrying about pleasing everyone else is another.
@robneyer Just like, I don't worry about what other people think of me. Same principle.
@robneyer Why are you so worried about what the rest of the world thinks? Screw em
@helchose @fabmissem @matthewjdowd Not EVERYTHING is about politics you know.
@jsouthlynn @Lawrence About 7 years
@fabmissem @matthewjdowd Ok, but you know what he's doing. And by the way, tons of retail chains are hurting. Internet a d Wal-Mart's are killing them
@fabmissem @matthewjdowd This has nothing to do with him. It's called capitalism.
@fabmissem @matthewjdowd Govt involved in coals demise, not toysruses. Wrong or right. Dowd's tweet is nonsensical. Looking for every little thing to attack DT.
@unhipcat @matthewjdowd Not arguing g if regs r wrong or right just saying big difference
@fabmissem @matthewjdowd Not arguing of the regs are wrong or right just saying big difference.
@rollcall So that means most approve. Where is the story?
@matthewjdowd Difference is coal mining industry was being hurt by regulations. Toysrus is going under because of internet sale boom, not government regs

@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn Why do the Americans he's not hiring have to be minorities. Doesn't it show they rather hire foreigners than Americans period?
@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn is that racist somehow?
@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn look in the mirror, and lighten up by the way. Life is too short to take evrything so seriously, including yourself. have some fun

@TGOD412Pixburgh @_BigBen7 @steelers False? Whatever you got to do to go to sleep at night buddy
@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn All of a sudden he's racist. Get outta here. Everything is racist. Keep it up, your guaranteeing 8 instead of 4.
@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn Trump is not a good or smooth speaker hes arrogant bombastic &amp; I would say insecure. I live in NYC hes been in spotlight for last 30 yrs
@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn Judge by actions not words. He's hired how many minorities? His son in law and grandkids are orthodox Jews.
@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn That's anecdotal, and out of context, he's obviously joking around. I talk like that too with my friends, does t make me a racist.
@TGOD412Pixburgh @_BigBen7 @steelers I know you are but what am I? Nice!
@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn Everything is racist, it's quite frankly exhausting
@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn I disagree
@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn Heres the thing if you go looking for racism or anything else for that matter in everything someone says you'll find it
@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn That's a little bit of a leap, no? The word some means an unknown quantity, not most or a little. You just want to hear it that way.
@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn Some Trump supporters aren't criminals	Some Trump supporters aren't doctors	Some Trump supporters aren't gay	All true statements
@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn Yeah aren't is the opposite of are. So?
@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn Because some of the things duke wants coincided with some of Trump campaign promises.
@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn Ok and some probably are, what's your point?
@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn David Duke is racist Because he likes Trump doesn't make Trump racist David Duke likes strawberry ice cream, strawberry ice cream not racist
@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn That was when he was talking about illegal immigrants from Mexico. He's saying that some of them are good people. What's wrong with that?
@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn It was a stupid thing to say, but it wasn't racist.
@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn When asked if he thought Mexicans or mexican Americans couldn't be fair judges he answered absolutely not. He shouldn't have said it
@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn And when asked to explain he said he's mexican, I'm building a wall he's proud of his heritage and I don't think he can be fair.
@_BigBen7 @steelers Hillbilly rapist
@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn People like you calling everything racist is why we have this guy as President.
@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn He didnt say all mexicsns shouldn't be judges because they cant be fair That would be racist Im American calling me an Italian is not racist
@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn The group La Rasa, that the judge is a member of came out against him. He questioned the judges ability to be fair in his case.
@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn Right because it was viewed by many Hispanics that Trump was being unfair to them. That's not racist.
@adammbirnbaum @Eddie_Paul85 @NYCMayor Did you see Rand Paul's DACA compromise? Interested in your thoughts.
@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn If he said All Mexicans r incapable of being fair that would be a racist statement. By masking everything racist you diminishing real racism
@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn He is a Mexican-american. Im an Italian-American. Ive been called just "italian" millions of times. Thats not racist. It's colloquial speech
@nypost Can't do anything good in this godforsaken liberal paradise anymore, 7 more years till I retire and move to America!
@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn What discrimination in business And I still dont understand whats racist in what he did with cp5Again he may have been wrong but not racist.
@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn He may have been wrong to say it, but it's not racist.
@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn When everything is racist, nothing is. Yes or no, many Mexican Americans do not like Trump? That's why he said he couldn't be impartial.

@MikeParentLEAP @kalpenn 1st off, I was talking about Kal's tweet. He saidJudge couldnt be fair because he wanted to build a wall which is unpopular in Mex community
@kalpenn Wait so being against illegal immigration is white supremacy? I thought WS was the belief that the white race is superior.

@adammbirnbaum @Eddie_Paul85 @NYCMayor Let's make it difficult to get away with and less will try. Let's make it easier to do legally and more will try it that way.
@adammbirnbaum @Eddie_Paul85 @NYCMayor Encouraging illegal immigration is encouraging people to do dangerous things. A lot of these people are risking their lives coming here.
@adammbirnbaum @Eddie_Paul85 @NYCMayor I am all for immigrants coming here. It's what makes our Country great. But we cannot allow people to cheat because we feel bad for them.
@adammbirnbaum @Eddie_Paul85 @NYCMayor By cracking down on illegal immigration, we could streamline LEGAL immigration.
@adammbirnbaum @Eddie_Paul85 @NYCMayor Doing so makes it clear that in the future you must follow our rules and laws to get on the path to citizenship.

@Ms_Scruff @Dab_Tsog @jmcappiello @DealyPlazaEcho Interesting, thanks.Id say we probably eat a little too much meat in this country. Anything heavily processed is no good.
@Dab_Tsog @jmcappiello @DealyPlazaEcho I agree with you on that.
@Dab_Tsog @jmcappiello @DealyPlazaEcho If lions could figure out how to breed and keep zebra, so they wouldn't have to hunt them, they would. The human animal has.
@Ms_Scruff @Dab_Tsog @jmcappiello @DealyPlazaEcho Canines are there to rend flesh also. Chimpanzees and apes, your frugivore, eat meat also.
@Dab_Tsog @jmcappiello @DealyPlazaEcho Who says they have, it's a very long process
@Dab_Tsog @jmcappiello @DealyPlazaEcho We are omnivores. Studies have shown that our large brains and our intelligence evolved partially from when we started eating meat.
@Dab_Tsog @jmcappiello @DealyPlazaEcho I agree with you there, we weren't meant to eat processed foods. But we are omnivores.
@doreli12 @theFelitron The line are the thousands of people who are trying to become citizens legally. If you allow illegal immigration, you are encouraging it.
@theFelitron @KamalaHarris @TheDemocrats So don't you think by allowing them to cut the line, you are encouraging illegal immigration? Which by the way can be very dangerous.
@NYCMayor They are line cutters
@jmcappiello @DealyPlazaEcho It's not amazing. Humans eat meat. It's nature. Lions eat zebras by brutally murdering them. Nature is not always pretty.

@nsuljic @Mattbernal916 @lostNconfuzed @alanseeling @SenSanders @jimjefferies And guns have been around forever. Why weren't there so many years ago? Guns haven't changed much in 30 years. Why? Not How.
@nsuljic @Mattbernal916 @lostNconfuzed @alanseeling @SenSanders @jimjefferies I don't have my gun to help the police.  And most people that own guns don't own guns to help the police.

@nsuljic @Mattbernal916 @lostNconfuzed @alanseeling @SenSanders @jimjefferies I bet a lot more than you think. But it's not politicized and therefore doesn't warrant media attention. There are a lot more cars than guns

@nsuljic @lostNconfuzed @alanseeling @SenSanders @jimjefferies Everyone should submit to backround check to buy firearms. I agree also. Even at gun shows.
@nsuljic @lostNconfuzed @alanseeling @SenSanders @jimjefferies Guns have been around forever, these shootings get more and more frequent.
@nsuljic @lostNconfuzed @alanseeling @SenSanders @jimjefferies Only if buying from a non licensed private seller and still need b-round checks in 19 states. Guns aren't the problem, people are.
@nsuljic @lostNconfuzed @alanseeling @SenSanders @jimjefferies Gunman was from Illinois, to obtain gun legally so did he.
@nsuljic @lostNconfuzed @alanseeling @SenSanders @jimjefferies I had to submit to one in order to get my permit. Full back round check and they fingerprinted me.
@nsuljic @lostNconfuzed @alanseeling @SenSanders @jimjefferies We don't know how this guy got his gun. If he got it legally or illegally.  Issue is how to tell good guys from bad.

@kernals12 they're all against us kid. Take care of your own, be good to your neighbor. Don't believe a word any of them say. Nice debating
@kernals12 follow the money, Wall st. Owns democrats also. Clinton helped banking &amp; corporations by deregulating mortgage industry and NAFTA
@kernals12 In this instance I agree with him. On others I dont. You don't have to blindly follow your "party" think 4 yourself
@kernals12 This is how they divide and conquer.
@kernals12 Dont label me.I believe in many things considered liberal as well as things that conservative. Why do we have to be put in a box?
@kernals12 I am slowly losing faith in the intelligence of humanity. We are lost and will never be found.
@kernals12 1st of all, who are my people? To answer your question, it's not making it harder to vote. It's really really easy to get an ID.
@kernals12 This is used to create more racial divisiveness and keep people like you and I arguing while they rob us blind.
@kernals12 because they could care less if you live in poverty AZ long as they get your vote.  raise people up not enable them to stay down
@kernals12There r a lot of things you can't do without id. Every adult should have one. No one cares about the other things you can't do
@kernals12 Why  make it "hard" to drive a car? Get a loan? Get a job? My point is, it's not hard to get an ID. Not having one holds u back
@kernals12 stop coddling, suck it up and improve your life. No one owes you anything.
@kernals12 Sometimes gotta put on your big boy pants and get stuff done Evrythin a problem If this how youth of USA  think now, we doomed
@kernals12 Stop drinking KOOL Aid and use your head kid. Really think. All they care about on both sides are votes.
@kernals12 How Long does it take? it took 2 hours NYC20 yrs ago.Now its quicker And the middle of nowhere im sure it takes a lot quicker too
@kernals12Democrat party really cared about theses people they would be helping to get them ID'S ,instead of just worrying about their vote.
They don't have 2 hours in their whole life to go get something that greatly enables them to be a part of our society? Really? Cmon man.
@kernals12 So they can't afford to go vote then either I guess. Maybe they'd be able to get a better job if they had an ID.
@kernals12 what does that have to do with anything?
@kernals12 for an ID? don't know, I'm from NY. I have a drivers license. It took a couple hours...in NYC.

@drmtesta @RichCimini Why pay Kerley now? Could've signed Sanders for basically same. Flowers 1 yr deal, Cro 1 yr deal, Lloyd 1yr, no risk.
@drmtesta @RichCimini Agreed, but how can you properly eval QB without decent weapons. Instead of overpaying Decker should've signed 2.
@drmtesta @RichCimini you honestly think he's doing a good job? Going into season w rookie CB&amp; 2nd yr CB? Signing 1 Wr, leaving $ on table?
