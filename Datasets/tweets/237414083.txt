@kawarren818 @worldpeace2701 @TheRightMelissa I didn't block you.
@kawarren818 @TheRightMelissa @worldpeace2701 I meant 90 percent of women who are own foodstamps  have babies.
@kawarren818 @TheRightMelissa @worldpeace2701 90 percent of women with babies are on food stamps yet the Republican's and their followers want to cut food stamps.  A baby is damned when it comes into the world if the mother can't afford to feed, cloth and put a roof over said babies head.  Most on food stamps barely make it.
@TheRightMelissa Besides, what happens in FRANCE isn't what happens in the U.S.  		MK, a student nurse in France, tells the following story:
@TheRightMelissa Sorry, I have been looking for the story in other publications and there are none.  So this is fake NEWS.
@kawarren818 @TheRightMelissa @worldpeace2701 LOL where have you been and why haven't you been paying attention to what the Republican congress has been saying and doing for the past 20 years?
@kawarren818 @TheRightMelissa @worldpeace2701 Paul Ryan wanted to do aways with foodstamps, my family who I chat with on Facebook (yes they vote Republican) wants to do away with food stamps, and I have chatted with several others who vote Republican who wants to do away with food stamps.
@worldpeace2701 @kawarren818 @TheRightMelissa Do yourself a favor and quit listening to the negativity of the Republican party then we can meet in the middle and discuss things.
@Allison21837532 @TheRightMelissa @worldpeace2701 You know, you benefit from "Socialism" every day of the week when you drive to work, use the water that comes into your facets, etc.......
@realDonaldTrump It was as funny as when you were spewing the same thing.  All Baldwin did was repeat you almost word for word.
@SarahPalinUSA
@kawarren818 @TheRightMelissa @worldpeace2701 The republican's want to take food stamps and any social program from the mothers who need it.  They call them the WELFARE QUEENS and are lazy bums or low lifes because they don't make enough money to support their child.  I even hear that from my own family who are Republicans.
@kawarren818 @TheRightMelissa @worldpeace2701 So you would rather the baby be born then starve it to death by taking food stamps from the mother.

@TheRightMelissa @worldpeace2701 What about when those babies make it home and the mother has been turned down on food stamps, etc....?    I am against abortion but I also think mothers should have social programs to substain said child once born, NOT "LIFE UP TO BIRTH, THEN THE CHILD BE DAMED".
@realDonaldTrFan You know when you dish it out you need to expect things to come back and hit you in the face.  What goes around comes back around and sometimes it is far worse than what you throw.
@worldpeace2701 @Bubba_42993 @rosadelauro @SpeakerPelosi They would have the right to feel the same as I do if they had been treated the way women have been treated in the work place for many a year.  Until the man has walked in a woman's shoes and treated a the woman has been treated, 	he will NEVER know how it  feels.
@Bubba_42993 @JustaTe97641840 @rosadelauro @SpeakerPelosi This is about male verses female pay, not bringing in someone from somewhere else that is far better at a job than you did in maintenance.   If a women is doing the same job and getting far less pay than you, it is discrimination.
@Bubba_42993 @rosadelauro @SpeakerPelosi I was paid less than the man I was training, so you try again.

@realDonaldTrFan So you wore it because you meant to, huh?
@Bubba_42993 @rosadelauro @SpeakerPelosi If when hired, a company should pay a woman exactly what they pay a man and if the women doesn't live up to the standards then she should be fired.   But from experience, if a man doesn't live up to the standards, it is still the woman fired.
@JustaTe97641840 @Bubba_42993 @rosadelauro @SpeakerPelosi That isn't so and very construed on your part.
@realDonaldTrFan A wall isn't going to stop drug trafficing.  Hire more border patrol and give them more things to find and catch those people who are bringing drugs into the country.
@Bubba_42993 @rosadelauro @SpeakerPelosi I volunteer at a museum which is in a law firm which caters to mostly women who have been treated this way.  When you have seen 20 and 30 women come in every week or so to consult the attorney's on this same issue, you wouldn't question it.
@Bubba_42993 @rosadelauro @SpeakerPelosi You haven't been in the right company then.  I have always given 150 percent whether it be for the minimum wage or the 18 an hour I have been making.   The men where I have worked were always given more per hour than a woman.  I know, I did the payrolls.
@Bound2BHappy @rosadelauro @SpeakerPelosi I did and they are no longer in business.
@Bound2BHappy @rosadelauro @SpeakerPelosi in who were let go because they wanted as much as a man was paid.  Since Texas is a right to work state, the companies can fire just because.
@Bound2BHappy @rosadelauro @SpeakerPelosi I realize it isn't that way all over but there is a major gender pay gap whether anyone wants to believe it or not.  The 3 places where I worked in human resources, I saw to much of it.  I now help out in  a museum which is in an attorney's office and I see a lot of people.....
@Bound2BHappy @rosadelauro @SpeakerPelosi No, I didn't go back!
@Bound2BHappy @rosadelauro @SpeakerPelosi Guess what, after 1 week of training him, I quit.  Three weeks later they were calling me asking me to come back.  I said as long as I got the $5.00 more an hour than the $18.00 he was getting.  What a bummer, I already had another job making the $18 they paid him
@Bound2BHappy @rosadelauro @SpeakerPelosi Same exact job, way less education than me and just starting out in human resources.  In fact I was having to train him but yet they felt he needed more money than me.
@Bound2BHappy @rosadelauro @SpeakerPelosi Why should he?  he was already making $5.00 dollars more an hour than I was and he didn't have the education I have.  It was a man thing.
@WhiteHouse https://t.co/a2ZdnT6pn1
@Bound2BHappy @rosadelauro @SpeakerPelosi Another thing, I started 2 years before a man in human resources and they started him out at $5.00 an hour more than I was making at the time.
@Bound2BHappy @rosadelauro @SpeakerPelosi Conservative women doesn't do a deep dive either.  I have worked in human resources in 3 different company's and I can honestly say the men were paid more than the women and only because "they had families".

@Bound2BHappy @rosadelauro @SpeakerPelosi Wow, you are so ignorant.  It does exist and women who are in the position of making less money don't dare quit because they know jobs paying the same as a man doesn't exist.  How they get the amount of what a man made last year is raised only after the man gets a raise today.
@suewisc @rmcauley4 @rosadelauro @SpeakerPelosi Oh, and Texas women are very tough and can keep up where work is concerned.  Even beat a man at things.

@Bubba_42993 @rosadelauro @SpeakerPelosi From experience, usually the woman goes far over what the man does when it comes to performing the duties of the job and usually is the first one layed off when layoffs come.
@nefan77 @rosadelauro @SpeakerPelosi It is my understanding A man is offered the same thing a woman is in this situation except the woman doesn't get paid while on maternity leave.   I don't know of any man willing to take off for maternity leave if it means losing that pay check.
@Rastor77 @rosadelauro @SpeakerPelosi So a woman with many kids doesn't deserve the same pay, right?  I ask an employer once after being told a man had a family was the reason he got more money, I ask him "What do you think I have, Chickens"?

@elkmen1 @1791BVR @SarahPalinUSA Also, Congress should make a law to protect Social Security by blocking a president from borrowing money from SS.
@artist35 @SarahPalinUSA And your take is that those kids once born should die from starvation and not have a decent life.  I am not saying a rich life but one where he or she should be able to make something of his or her self when they get older.  A hungry child tends to rob peoples houses.
@elkmen1 @1791BVR @SarahPalinUSA "Bush 'borrowed' $1.37 trillion of Social Security surplus revenue to pay for his tax cuts for the rich and his war in Iraq and never paid it back." By law, the Social Security surplus is converted into bonds, and the cash is used by the Treasury to pay for government expenses.
@elkmen1 @1791BVR @SarahPalinUSA I agree but the damage is done.  If Congress does it again, there should be an uprising.
@artist35 @SarahPalinUSA Why don't you try to get me off.  I have as much right to speak as you do.  You know, freedom of speech?

@Knodgerod @SarahPalinUSA Bull Crap  The Repugs fought Obama all the way through the 6 years they were under Obama.  It was the Republican bills that made it through to Obama.  They spent most of the time fighting the Affordable Health Care Act which was drawn from the Romney Care bill of MASS.

@SarahPalinUSA , ABC, NBC, and CBS deemed the speech too 'overtly political.' Tonight, those same networks will broadcast a speech by Pres. Trump calling for a border wall. (NowThis is streaming Trump's speech tonight with real-time fact-checking.)
@SarahPalinUSA NETWORKS BLOCKED OBAMA, NOT TRUMP: In 2014, America's major broadcast networks refused to air this primetime speech on immigration by Pres. Obama. Even though the speech announced a series of major new immigration policies
@k9workforce @SarahPalinUSA LOL I have given the Republican's credit where credit was due but the right have never given the Democrats any credit where credit was due.  See the 4th post back. HYPOCRITE.
@Knodgerod @SarahPalinUSA Don't forget, Republican's were writting the bills for 6 of Obama's years and fighting him the whole way.
@1961sarahw @SarahPalinUSA The deficit was based on 2016 but there have been 3 years since which have droven up the deficit even more.  You forget, there were REPUBLICAN controled houses in 2016 who were driving the deficit right up to 2019 along with Trump.
@Knodgerod @SarahPalinUSA She served as the director of the Women's Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union during the 1970s which was a good thing.

@k9workforce @SarahPalinUSA Wow, I have never said the Democrats are perfect.  It is the  right who defends their party to no end and lets them screw the little person who struggles through life not being able to make it because their pay is stagnated and what they purchase continues to escalate.

@k9workforce @SarahPalinUSA It only became a "well he did it first" after 18 years of the right complaining about the Democrats whether what the Democrats did was wrong or not.
@k9workforce @SarahPalinUSA HUM, seems the Right has always condemned the Democrats and then looked the other way when it comes to a Republican, hence Clinton and Obama and Clinton.  They were always a bad guy to the Republican supporters but then a Republican could not do any wrong.
@SarahPalinUSA Who is going to put food in those babies bellies once they are born?  Rightie's policies "LIFE RIGHT UP TO BIRTH THEN THE CHILD BORN BE DAMNED".
@RoyWeav21983331 OH, and boo hoo hoo because you seem to not think that calling a woman horseface and insulting other politicians.  Why do you defend someone who is uncouth.  Until Trump, I was the most moral and civil person you would ever want to meet.  I even voted for republicans.
@RoyWeav21983331 Trump is a crybaby, he started the crap on the campaign trail of calling politician's, women, minorities, judges names and now he is crying that it is falling back on him.  What goes around comes back around.  I haven't been near as nasty as Trump.
@mediaiscorrupt @SarahPalinUSA Tell me when Obama ever said things so insulting against Judges, minorities and even politicians.  He didn't and if you say he did you need to do some investigating and prove it because it didn't happen.
@k9workforce @SarahPalinUSA I am implying that she was no disrespectful than Trump has been to those he has insulted.  Trump starts it then complains when it is thrown back in his face.
@Binks667 @SarahPalinUSA I am not President who has been name calling since when ever, long before even considering to run for president.  I am not a politician and these people are the ones who are representative of our great nation and should not be doing this.  Shame on Trump for starting it.
@SarahPalinUSA If Trump wants respect, he should not act like the a**hole he is.  He needs to grow up and quit being a baby when he doesn't get his way or is confronted.   It takes a strong minded person to be able to take all in without getting nasty.
@SarahPalinUSA WOW the Trump  a**hole uses profanity all the time against all, women included and when a women calls him a profanity name, he comes unglued.  What a HYPOCRITE and anyone who gets irritated at the person who calls Trump a profane name.

@1961sarahw @SarahPalinUSA No, Bush tripled the deficit and yes, Obama signed in the first 3 months an amount that put another trillion on the deficit but, by 2011 when the Republicans took control of the House and Senate, the deficit had dropped back down.  It is now climbing higher than ever before.

@Dennis4IU @BetsyGervasi President Reagan was sworn in before allowing the plane with the hostages to take off. The Iranians had a deep hatred of Carter and wanted to deny him this last moment of victory as President.
@Dennis4IU @BetsyGervasi Ted Koppel described this as the Iranians' last act of cruelty toward President Carter. Even though the United States and Iran had come to an agreement to free the hostages in December, the Iranians waited literally until the hour
@Dennis4IU Trump lied again to the military personnel he told them they got a 10 percent pay raise;  increase for 2019 passed by Congress and signed by the president in August will be 2.6 percent, the largest since 2010. It is not far above last year’s raise forroops, which was 2.4 percent.

@Dennis4IU @BetsyGervasi His legacy is also significant for what he did not do: he did not start any wars.
@Dennis4IU @BetsyGervasi As for civil liberties, Carter also signed the most significant reform of government surveillance powers since World War II in the original FISA Act, and in 1979, he called for the decriminalization of marijuana, well ahead of the cultural and political curve.
@Dennis4IU @BetsyGervasi . Today, there are 1,400 American breweries. And home brewing for personal consumption is also now legal.
@Dennis4IU @BetsyGervasi The impact of beer deregulation has been similarly overlooked: In 1978, the USA had just 44 domestic breweries. After deregulation, creativity and innovation flourished in the above-ground economy
@Dennis4IU @BetsyGervasi -- In 1974, it was illegal for an airline to charge less than $1,442 in inflation-adjusted dollars for a flight between New York City and Los Angeles. On Kayak, just now, I found one for $278.
@Dennis4IU @BetsyGervasi -- In 1965, no more than 20 percent of Americans had ever flown in an airplane. By 2000, 50 percent of the country took at least one round-trip flight a year. The average was two round-trip tickets.	-- The number of air passengers tripled between the 1970s and 2011.
@Dennis4IU @BetsyGervasi At the Atlantic, Derek Thompson chronicles the dramatic and almost unnoticed impact of Carter’s airline deregulation over the last thirty years. The bottom line: per-mile ticket prices fell by over fifty percent. And the results have transformed American social life and travel:

@Dennis4IU @BetsyGervasi The recession of the 70's started in 73 but Although the economy was expanding from 1975 to the first recession of the early 1980s, which began in January 1980, inflation remained extremely high until the early 1980s.https://t.co/sErfj8DocV

@BrokenScales @zephbe @realDonaldTrump But you call Obama a liar for saying if he had a son he would probably look like Treyvon but you don't call Trump a liar when he spews thousands of lies.  HYPOCRITAL indeed.
@BrokenScales @zephbe @realDonaldTrump Before 2010 NC's districts were done by state legislators but after 2010 that changed.  I call that Hypocritical when the Republican's blame the other for something that was done legally and they don't do it legally.
@BrokenScales @zephbe @realDonaldTrump In most cases, a state's district lines--for both state legislative and congressional districts--are redrawn by the state legislature, and the majority party controls the process. Some states require bi-partisan or non-partisan commissions to oversee the line-drawing.

@BrokenScales @zephbe @realDonaldTrump That is a blantant lie.  I was a  Republican supporter back in the late 60's and 70's.  I voted for Nixon and then Ford.  Ford was a good person but two nice.  It wasn't until I so what Reagan was doing to the people making the minimum wage that turned me off.
@BrokenScales @zephbe @realDonaldTrump Trump turn's his back on people who were his friends.  How do you know Hillary throws things across the room, were you there.  We know the hatred Trump spews because it is in the news and comes out of his own mouth.
@BrokenScales @zephbe @realDonaldTrump HUM it is now coming out that people in Trump's organization did in fact collude with Russia and others.  That List is not lies but blames.  Trump has literally told thousands of lies since he darkened the door of the White House much less on the campaign trail.
@BrokenScales @zephbe @realDonaldTrump And that all started under Ronald Reagan.  Before Reagan, medical was not a profitable organization.  Then insurance company's took over and escalated out of control.   There were regulations on medical before Reagan but the Republican's cut those regulations.

@DeltaBill2 @SarahPalinUSA In the 40's, they didn't make it a big deal to be in the states illegally.  In fact, mexican's would come to work the fruit farms and veggie fields and weren't harassed.  My grand parents worked the cotton fields with mexican's and they got along just fine.

@mjmissy @SarahPalinUSA YOU STILL HAVE NOT PRODUCED WHERE OBAMA TOOK SMALL CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS AND PUT THOSE BABIES IN PENS.
@mjmissy @SarahPalinUSA SOME OF THOSE SMALL CHILDREN NEVER HAVE MADE IT BACK TO THEIR PARENTS WHO WERE SHIPPED BACK TO THEIR HOME COUNTRY.  DO YOUR RESEARCH.  I REFUSE TO DO MORE FOR YOU.
@mjmissy @SarahPalinUSA Again, we are talking about small children who were taken from their parents by the Trump administration, those teens in 2014 came here on their own, not with their PARENTS!   TRUMP AND COMPANY TOOK BABIES AND YOUNG CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS AND LOCKED THEM AWAY IN PENS.
@realDonaldTrump FAKE PRESIDENT, FAKE PRESIDENT, FAKE PRESIDENT.   A  true president try's to bring the country together.  You are trying to divide the country by race and creed.

@mjmissy @SarahPalinUSA NOW SINCE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO RESEARCH, READ AND WEAP, OBAMA DIDN'T TAKE CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS AND PUT THEM IN CAMPS, THOSE CHILDREN WERE OLD ENOUGHT TO TRAVEL BY THEM SELFS WITHOUT THEIR PARENTS.
@mjmissy @SarahPalinUSA the children who have been separated from their parents are often much younger, and had not expected to be taken away from their families. https://t.co/ynWfNSyuhc
@mjmissy @SarahPalinUSA That difference is significant  while unaccompanied children in 2014 knew what to expect when they arrived at the border and were taken to the holding facilities,
@mjmissy @SarahPalinUSA Children were not taken from their parents and put into camps.  Children that came here on their own were treated just as adults were treated.
@mjmissy @SarahPalinUSA I will tell you the same thing I told Palin, if you have any proof of what you believe then produce it.  Otherwise, keep your thoughts to yourself. I have been doing research since IRAN/CONTRA and Reagan would be tried for being a TRAITOR.

@realDonaldTrump Warren didn't say she was an American Indian only that she had indian heritage and her dna proved it.  She can't join an American Indian Tribe because the indian in her is not high enough. You have to have 25% of indian heritage to be classified as an indian in a tribe.

@realDonaldTrump Only you want this.
@SarahPalinUSA Question both on a polygraph and see which one is telling the truth.

@Mike14034253 @HillaryClinton NO, Africa was messed up long before Hillary and Obama became involved.  WOW, you have a very narrow mind as to what you read and want to believe.
@Mike14034253 @HillaryClinton Why, in Africa they give kids rifles and let them shoot at anything human that moves.  Looks like that is happening here in the States.
@Mike14034253 @HillaryClinton HUM, My great, great, great Grandfather was one of the ones who brought slaves from Africa to America. My family goes back long before the pilgrims.   We are suppose to be a country that welcomes all who are in trouble (the CHRISTIAN THING TO DO) in their country to ours.
@Mike14034253 @SenSanders WOW have you not been paying attention to Donald Trump at all.  He would love to kill freedom of the Press which would eventually take away your freedom to say what you want and put anything on Twitter you want to say.
@Mike14034253 @SenSanders I didn't want to insult the GOP with a second nasty word because the Commies aren't any different than the NAZI who want to control the average American especially women and minorities.
@Mike14034253 @HillaryClinton I remember California being fine in the 50's.  It wasn't until the energy shortage started in the1990's that changed california, Remember how Enron screwed California's energy factor?    Texan's don't move, people from other states come here because of our no state income tax.
@Mike14034253 @SenSanders HUM have you actually read what the NAZI's stand for?  They are the ones who would keep your rights like freedom of speech such as Trump is trying to do.
@Mike14034253 @HillaryClinton Nope, I was born, raised and still live in Texas.  It was the scum GOP'ers who moved here to get away for caring liberals.  I was once a Texas  Republican when they were reasonable.  It was a Californian who started changing Texas.
@Mike14034253 But have they denied those assertions?   and about the Republican's that is pure bull crap.
@David42828981 @SarahPalinUSA I know it is one reason they ask the same question on 3 separate polygrap's in 3 different ways.
@andyscandy10 @billmaher That is one reason I think they will get a divorce after his term in office.
@cg_lambert @realDonaldTrump Yes, but it is changing faster since people on earth found fossil fuels.  The bible says man will foul the earth and water with their feet.
@andyscandy10 @billmaher I don't think that Melania will still be married to Trump after he is out of office.   I believe he made a deal with her to stay with him until then.
@Mike14034253 @HillaryClinton Historically, Sierra Leone and Liberia have had high crime rates, and travelers should be cautious,  if traveling alone. South Africa has also earned a reputation as dangerous, with carjackings and muggings common. Throughout the continent, pickpocketing and theft are prevalent.
@Mike14034253 @HillaryClinton The right wants the U.S. to look like countries in Africa.
@jamie_saris @_yorkenstein @HillaryClinton A. Jamie, you beat me to it.
@_yorkenstein @HillaryClinton OH that's the reason they put alcohol detectors on cars when a person has had more than a couple of DWI's.  So in reality, they are also blaming the car.
@NBCNews When a person is guilty of something they turn it back on someone they hate.  Trump has done this over and over and over.
@billmaher @andyscandy10 LOL means they really don't care for him.  "wink"

@cg_lambert @realDonaldTrump The ice melt started long before the volcanic activity and the ice melt started the volcanic activity.  Scientist differ on these opinions.
@David42828981 @SarahPalinUSA Maybe the test my X and I took should also be applied to all who take a polygraph test.   If a person is a liar, they will be caught in the lie if the question is ask over and over in different forms.
@rtabs @SarahPalinUSA thing that has to do with their body.  But on abortion, it is life right up to birth then the baby can starve because the right wants to take the social programs from them.
@rtabs @SarahPalinUSA But jurior's let the perp's go free so the legal system isn't working.  The senate needs to do something to change that.  Women will be screwed when the progress from Roe V Wade is over turned.   Roe V Wade wasn't just about abortions, it was about Women being able to choose any.
@DeepStateExpose @realDonaldTrump LIE, Trump isn't a true Christian.  A true Christian would not have had 3 wives, had affairs on all three wives, talked hate talk about women and minorities, etc, etc. etc.
@realDonaldTrump Two hurricane's in less than a month.  Al Gore can now say "I told you so".  With the Artic melting, seems the ocean is warming and the more the ocean warms the more hurricane's will form.  Most of them will hit the U.S.A.  Are you ready to pay more taxes to rebuild?
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS God is getting back at you because of global warming.
@David42828981 @SarahPalinUSA He was told in front of me that I was 10 times better a parent than he was.
@David42828981 @SarahPalinUSA I wasn't given a polygraph, but I was given a test by childrens protective services.  They repeated questions multible times in the test and I never changed my response.  They also tested my X husband.  After it was over they told him I was more honest than he was.
@David42828981 @SarahPalinUSA She at least took the polygraph test and past.  I know they catch people in other lies on polygraphs that have nothing to do with the subject at hand.
@David42828981 @SarahPalinUSA She passed the polygraph test on all three test.  They do three test for a reason.
RT @FKNFairyPrinces: @SarahPalinUSA @JCrochunis So I see you haven't posted bail for your son yet.

@David42828981 @SarahPalinUSA Ford passed the polygraph test 100 percent that was given to her.  Kavanaugh didn't want one and I doubt Trump would ever take one because every other word that comes out of his mouth is a lie.
@rtabs @SarahPalinUSA And men lie about not having a sexual assault and get their buddies to lie for them.  Kavanaugh was going to be confirmed whether the charge stuck or didn't.  Look at how Hill was treated.

@yappychickn @anono2 @GlamazonBeast @SarahPalinUSA @HillaryClinton The report says there wasn't any DNA on the dress so you believe the actual report or not because I don't care.  But, as I said, A Democrat is damned if they do and damned if they don't but a Republican thinks their party can do no wrong even if they committed murder.
@yappychickn @anono2 @GlamazonBeast @SarahPalinUSA @HillaryClinton I think I showed you the report first.
@yappychickn @anono2 @GlamazonBeast @SarahPalinUSA @HillaryClinton There wasn't any DNA on MONICA'S dress.
@anono2 @yappychickn @GlamazonBeast @SarahPalinUSA @HillaryClinton No, Senators cuss, rant and rave.  I don't see us doing that.
@anono2 @yappychickn @GlamazonBeast @SarahPalinUSA @HillaryClinton Monica admits that she had a blow job with Clinton and Clinton also admitted it.  So what.
@yappychickn @anono2 @GlamazonBeast @SarahPalinUSA @HillaryClinton No, they just didn't find any DNA on the dress.  I don't like the fact that Democrats are labeled as trash and the trashy Republican's are labeled as saints.  Do you really believe Trump goes to Church?  How does he get to the golf course so early on Sunday.
@anono2 @yappychickn @GlamazonBeast @SarahPalinUSA @HillaryClinton AH now you are being silly.
@yappychickn @anono2 @GlamazonBeast @SarahPalinUSA @HillaryClinton No, the FBI didn't find any DNA on the dress.
@yappychickn @GlamazonBeast @SarahPalinUSA And people wonder why women don't report being attacked or raped.  See what Monica had done to her after the fact.   https://t.co/XpF0SaBAfz
@yappychickn @GlamazonBeast @SarahPalinUSA The investigation started before he lied under oath.  Yes he admitted what he had done on TV, but that isn't the point.  Good for him to be a man and stand up and take the blame unlike Trump and Kavanaugh.
@anono2 @yappychickn @GlamazonBeast @SarahPalinUSA @HillaryClinton How the sex scandal involving President Bill Clinton and White House intern ... FBI tests, however, find no DNA evidence on Lewinsky's clothes.  https://t.co/sCR398BZpI
@yappychickn @GlamazonBeast @SarahPalinUSA Sheesh, Clinton was also investigated over the Monica thing.  Or did you intentionally jump over the post I posted on the FBI of that? How the sex scandal involving President Bill Clinton and White House intern ... FBI tests, however, find no DNA evidence on Lewinsky's clothes.
@yappychickn @GlamazonBeast @SarahPalinUSA The decision to appoint a special prosecutor is made by the executive branch, historically by the president or attorney general (or acting attorney general). The only exception to this was the Teapot Dome special prosecutors, was mandated by a joint resolution of Congress.
@yappychickn @GlamazonBeast @SarahPalinUSA Operating under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Justice, the FBI is also a member of the U.S. Intelligence Community and reports to both the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence.
@yappychickn @GlamazonBeast @SarahPalinUSA Of counsel is, in the legal profession of the United States, often the title of an attorney who has a relationship with a law firm or an organization, but is not an associate or a partner. Some firms use titles such ascounsel", "special counsel", and "seniorcounsel" same concept.
@yappychickn @GlamazonBeast @SarahPalinUSA No, a special prosecutor ask for the FBI to do the investigation of Clinton.  A Special Prosecutor tries the case and brings charges.
@yappychickn @GlamazonBeast @SarahPalinUSA I am 72 years old, what do you think?  The FBI investigated Clinton for a sexual crime which wasn't a sexual crime and didn't investigate Kavanaugh.  Do you understand when it is political. Clinton was President when he was investigated.
@yappychickn @GlamazonBeast @SarahPalinUSA I know, Clinton was a Democrat and Kavanaugh is a Republican and repub's can't do no wrong even if they do wrong it wasn't wrong but if a Democrat does wrong, wrap them up and throw them out.

@GlamazonBeast @yappychickn @SarahPalinUSA 315 out of 1000 arrested for assault or rape are found guilty.  No wonder women don't report assaults or rapes, they know the man will get away with it and other women won't condemn the man for doing it.
@_luvTOTO @NBCNews They contact people who they know will lie about what happened.  I don't believe it was hearsay since Ford did pass that polygraph (lie detector test).
@GlamazonBeast @yappychickn @SarahPalinUSA Yeah, but the woman got a bad name at the point she was assaulted or raped, but that doesn't matter does it?
@yappychickn @GlamazonBeast @SarahPalinUSA No, she was coached to speak up, not what to say.  HUM something republican supporters do by twisting what was said just as their politicians do.

@INFRONTPRO_LA @SarahPalinUSA WASHINGTON — Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his Senate supporters       misrepresented the record          when they stated that three witnesses refuted Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that he sexually assaulted her at a party more than 30 years ago.Sep 28, 2018

@INFRONTPRO_LA @SarahPalinUSA I pity men who think a man is above the law.  I don't believe most men because most do tend to lie.  Look at Donald Trump who lies in every sentence.  He lied when he said Ford only said "I don't know" to every question when she answered every question, even passed a lie detector
@sfletcher57 @SarahPalinUSA They can tell when someone is lying.  blood pressure and heart rate goes up when one lies.  Why do you think they call it "poly graph"  It is also one reason they don't stop at 1 polygraph test, it is usually 3.
@GlamazonBeast @SarahPalinUSA I was called a slut, whore, etc..... and the boy's said if I gave it to one I should give it to all.  I don't blame her for not reporting.  https://t.co/bKtNCvIPAd
@GlamazonBeast @SarahPalinUSA Don't forget, she had to be coached to speak up.   If you had never been assaulted in the manner she was assaulted (I was) you would know why she didn't speak up back then.   Besides, only 310 out of 1000 reported actually are punished and then the girl has to suffer with fear
@SarahPalinUSA I believe Ford, she should not have been dissed like this.   There should have been a thorough investigation and Kavanaugh should have taken a lie detector test.

@Rowen22303404 @SenSanders Well the right doesn't believe anything a woman says about being assaulted or raped.

@Hiloix @MieczynskyjT @BeckySpartacus @HuffPost WOW when a Republican insults a Dem and the Dem responds in kind, it is only the Dem doing wrong according to you.
@karenmo17644301 @Stevegaston18 @oli18 @italianmom555 @JeaniefaetroonJ HUM, seems that is what Dem's were saying when Obama was in office.  At least the Repug's kept a leash on what Obama did but now they are doing the reverse for Trump.
@Hiloix @BeckySpartacus @MieczynskyjT @HuffPost Trump acts as if he thinks he is without sin, heck he plays golf on sunday instead of being in church and the right worship him.
@Hiloix @BeckySpartacus @MieczynskyjT @HuffPost Yes God knows the heart and my heart is right with Jesus.  I give to the poor and when I don't have I tell teach them how to get help.  Most on social programs are mothers who make the minimum wage or a little more with children.  Are you for getting rid of social programs?
@Pam93592944 @kwilli1046 I have worked jobs you wouldn't work, so yes, I am challenging you to go out and see what those jobs (any kind of labor) would do to your body.
@Hiloix @MieczynskyjT @BeckySpartacus @HuffPost WOW the godless calling someone else godless.  Anyone who doesn't think a working mother with children doesn't deserve aid from the government is godless.
@oli18 @JeaniefaetroonJ @Stevegaston18 I had both knees replaced in 2009 and after insurance I still owed $50,000 so I wonder how much your family member owed after the thousands the insurance paid.
@oli18 @JeaniefaetroonJ @Stevegaston18 Newly approved cancer drugs cost an average of $10,000 per month, with some therapies topping $30,000 per month, according to ASCO, which discussed the costs of cancer care at a recent meeting. Just a decade ago the average cost per month of new drugs was about $4,500.Jul 1, 2015
@oli18 @JeaniefaetroonJ @Stevegaston18 Most cancer drugs launched between 2009 and 2014 were priced at more than $100,000 per patient for one year of treatment. More recently, we've seen launch prices of more than $400,000 for a year of treatment.Mar 15, 2018
@oli18 @JeaniefaetroonJ @Stevegaston18 Insurance company's cut off after a certain amount so your family member would have still owed thousands and thousands of dollars for cancer treatment.
@PaulL1 @SarahPalinUSA Well, can understand opening in North Carolina but making it look like they are open across the country is fake news.  You are another example of poor morals the Republican party represents.

@DeborahDhough Monica went after Clinton, but the 13 year old girl that Trump assaulted didn't go after him.
@brendacarter155 @kwilli1046 By the way, the parents who weren't given asylum didn't abandon their children, Trump and company took the kids from them and when they needed to give them back Trump and company couldn't find the kids.
@brendacarter155 @kwilli1046 Again, a person who wants social benefits has to provide proof of U.S. birth certificate or a drivers license or U.S. state ID and Social Security Number.  A child of a foreign nation cannot get food stamps or even a welfare check.  Look it up.
@Dgmtexas Rates were even higher counting work among other household members: over 80 percent of SNAP households with a non-disabled adult, and 87 percent of households with children and a non-disabled adult, worked in this 25-month period.Mar 15, 2018

@Dgmtexas So far most republican's who have responded to me fit this.  https://t.co/MPC85msSvJ
@Dgmtexas Not promoting socialism only think that wages should be high enough for a woman with children should not have to ask for help from the government.  I was taken from my mother in 1952 because mother wasn't making enough to support 4 kids.  The Town didn't want to keep giving to us
@Dgmtexas I know what socialism is and you must believe in the Ayn Rand philosophy.  Just because I think that high education, health care, rent, utilities, food should be affordable to all doesn't make me anything other than an American.
@Dgmtexas If Social Security (that has been paid into for years) is socialism then so is veterans benefits which weren't paid into for years.  And NO, I didn't want sanders to be President.  My policy is that any mother who is working to make ends meet deserves the help should get it.
@oli18 @JeaniefaetroonJ @Stevegaston18 Well well, money does speak doesn't it.
@oli18 @JeaniefaetroonJ @Stevegaston18 And how did that happen, is your family rich enough to cover all the cost that got rid of that cancer?  I know my best friend didn't have the money so they had to let her die.  She couldn't even get help from the government because her husband made more than the minimum wage.
@Dennis4IU HUM Trump doesn't think we are, that is why he wants to build the wall and separate us from our Allies
@Dennis4IU WOW I didn't know 22 was a young girl.  Monica was a woman and had been for 4 years.
@Dgmtexas I know what socialism is, but you don't seem to know.   Just because someone would love to have health care doesn't mean; (in Marxist theory) a transitional social state between the overthrow of capitalism and the realization of communism.
@Hiloix @BeckySpartacus @MieczynskyjT @HuffPost HUM, strip teasers huh?    You do know that it is illegal to be a prostitute, don't you?  It isn't illegal for an old man to get a woman into his hotel room and then make a suggestion as to having sex with him but then only Republican's get away with that, a Democrat President no
@SuziQshell @Stevegaston18 @beth2_k3a Only if you didn't have insurance at the end of the year.
@Pam93592944 @kwilli1046 Really?  You willing to go work in the fields where the jobs are not being filled?  No one else who are citizens are willing because it doesn't pay much.
@brendacarter155 @kwilli1046 If they drop their kids and go back where they came from, what would you do with those kids?   But that isn't what happened now is it.   No, it doesn't allow the parent to collect benefits on the child.  They still have to prove the child was born here with a birth certificate.
@Dgmtexas I hope you never need the socialism program meant for Veterans.
@Dgmtexas Thank you for your service.

@italianmom555 @Stevegaston18 @JeaniefaetroonJ Read the bill that was passed by Clinton and the Republican congress in the 90's.  That is a false statement.  Most on food stamps have 2 children and they are single mothers who work and make the minimum wage.https://t.co/4LTxF15lxR

@kwilli1046 I think there are a lot of people out there who need to do a search on what an illegal can or cannot get in the U.S.

@oli18 @italianmom555 @Stevegaston18 @JeaniefaetroonJ I use to say the same thing but guess what, I ended up having to file bankruptcy when I couldn't pay my medical bills which after having to have both knees replaced and billers would not leave me alone.

@oli18 @Stevegaston18 @JeaniefaetroonJ That wasn't because of Obamacare.  My insurance in Dec. 2000 was $25 every two weeks, but 2009 it was $150.  Obamacare wasn't even in the making.
@oli18 @Stevegaston18 @JeaniefaetroonJ I was referred to the mineral metabolism clinic but then it was another 6 months before I could get into that clinic.  Seems Norway doesn't have it near as bad as those of us in the U.S. who have problems.

@SuziQshell @Stevegaston18 @beth2_k3a Blame Congress for taxes. The Constitution gives Congress the "the power to lay and collect taxes."  Of course, it does so to pay for government services. The largest of these are Social Security, Medicare and our nation's defense. https://t.co/g8bwR9bOT4
@SuziQshell @Stevegaston18 @beth2_k3a The $700 billion bailout helped the debt grow to $10.5 trillion by December 2008.	The economic stimulus package and other stimulus spending added another $3 trillion in two years. Military spending increased, while revenues from taxes declined after the recession.
@SuziQshell @Stevegaston18 @beth2_k3a At $21 trillion, the U.S. debt is the largest in the world. It is nearly equal to total annual economic production. How did it get so large? Even before the economic crisis, the debt grew 50 percent between 2000 and 2007, ballooning from $6 trillion to $9 trillion.
@SuziQshell @Stevegaston18 @beth2_k3a keep the Bush tax cuts for everyone and eliminate Obamacare. The change meant Obama had to negotiate with the lame duck Congress. That enabled the Obama tax cuts
@SuziQshell @Stevegaston18 @beth2_k3a In 2010, the House gained 60 Republicans. That created a majority who elected a new House Majority Leader, John Boehner. Republicans won an additional six seats in the Senate, but not the majority. The Republicans wanted to reduce the deficit,
@SuziQshell @Stevegaston18 @beth2_k3a If Congress insists on tax cuts, then the best kind are payroll tax cuts. They create 13 new jobs for every $1 million. If these employers only get the cuts when they create new jobs, it boosts job creation to 18 jobs per $1 million.
@SuziQshell @Stevegaston18 @beth2_k3a Dollar for dollar, tax cuts are not the best way to created jobs. The Bush tax cuts created 4.6 jobs for every $1 million in cuts, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Unemployment benefits created 19 jobs for the same $1 million spent.

@MikeTokes @realDonaldTrump Happens all the time in Private Schools.  The Principal instructed the kids to not report.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS HYPOCRITE, all of you.  If a Democrat had done what Kavanaugh did, you would not have allowed him onto the Supreme Court if a Democrat President had nominated him.   HYPOCRITE, HYPOCRITE, think of what you did in 1999 and then there was Clarence Thomas who also assaulted a women.
men who had assault charges brought against them.  Also, Clarence Thomas and now this other man accused of sexual assault being put on the Supreme Justice but if it had been someone a Democrat President wanted on the Supreme Court, the Republicans would refuse because of same?
Don't you find it strange that the Republican's condemned a President for having a fling before he even became president then impeached same president for a lie about a blow job then elects a man who had multiple assaults before he became president and then doesn't put blame on .
@SarahPalinUSA Will make 2 on the Supreme Justice who have been accused of sexual assault by a Republican President and gotten away with it but if it had been a Democrat who wanted someone like this, the republicans would not stand for it.  Hypocrites all of you.

@ChelseaClinton @OpenSociety Sorry to see the show go so soon, but face it Roseanne, John Goodman was the real comic of the show.
@therealroseanne Islam is a MUSLIM religion.  Being Muslim does not mean you are a bad person just as being Christian ( Crusades) weren't really bad in their day but did so much more damage that started the hatred by the Muslims today.

@therealroseanne HUH?
@realDonaldTrump Bone spur that could have been removed and you be up and OK in 6 weeks, was your excuse for not going to Vietnam.   I have had bone spurs removed on my feet and the surgery didn't keep me from getting around.  I guess a woman is stronger than a man.
@realDonaldTrump Your tax bill doesn't help anyone but you and your cronies.
@realDonaldTrump When you are spending more than you are taking in, it isn't making anything great again.   We will be owned by China or anyone else we owe money to.  You don't want to pay any taxes is the reason you wanted to be president.  Tax the poor and let them starve to death.

@chrislhayes Chris, it happened in the U.S. as well.  Look up the Ophran trains of the U.S. not all of those kids lost their parents.  I know, my family was one of them and we were taken from our mother because of the land we owned.
@realDonaldTrump REBUKE THE OPPRESSOR (Isaiah 1:17, NKJV)	 when one says something against him keeping a mistress, her name only goes to heat up his lust. How can I make you realize the misery of the poor? How can I make you understand that your wealth comes from their weeping?
@Shtzngiggles2 @therealroseanne By the way PROPREVENTION means a better paycheck but no one wants to raise the minimum wage.  If you think a company is going to give raises, I have a bridge in Dallas Texas to sell you.
@Shtzngiggles2 @therealroseanne It is to me when it comes to mothers with children who will lose their food stamps and other aid.  When you take from one, you take from all.  Of that what can't you understand.
@realDonaldTrump Looks like something you would do.  Infact your son did it to Hillary with Russia.
@Shtzngiggles2 @therealroseanne https://t.co/Ypz52bhYZg
@Shtzngiggles2 @therealroseanne Hum, for someone who hates children, you are retweeting a scripture about the greed of the wealthy.
@Shtzngiggles2 @therealroseanne You must hate children.  Most on food stamps are women with small children or are disabled or are senior citizens who no longer can work. Most of  Those senior citizens worked all of their lives.
@Shtzngiggles2 @therealroseanne You think a woman who works and has children aren't helping themselves.  You expect a baby to 16 or 18 years of age to work?  You would be the first to complain because they didn't get an education because they had to work and that poor baby, what could he or she do?
@Shtzngiggles2 @therealroseanne WOW, you think a working mother who has to ask for aid is a sloth,   HUM, I wonder what Jesus would say to you since Ruth was a distant grandparent of his.   Boaz gave to her and she didn't have any children at the time.  He married her.  shame on you.
@realDonaldTrump Your just trying to throw suspicion off yourself.   You have done so much immoral and criminal things over the years, hense look at your bankruptcy files.  Also, why haven't you done what your promised by putting out your income taxes.
@Shtzngiggles2 @therealroseanne Luke 11:39-42	Then the Lord said to him, ‘Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness. a But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and herbs of all kinds, and neglect justice and the love of God.’
@Shtzngiggles2 @therealroseanne I take it that you don't believe in the good book the way Trump says he does.  When you take from the mother by taking her food stamps and aid you are taking from the child.  So you believe in Birth right up to birth then starve the little ones.
@therealroseanne LOL, are you anything like the Roseanne on your TV show?
@realDonaldTrump The leaks are coming from you, so I have heard .
@therealroseanne Well, it is the cheapest thing an insurance will cover.  Blame them.
@realBigBalls I'm not sure Ann Coulter is a real female.
@therealroseanne I also have bone spurs from T7 to T12 in my spine which pushes on the nerves and makes it very hard to stand and sit up.  I also have spinal stenosis in my lower back which sometimes makes pain shoot down my legs.   Medicare will only cover surgery which is crap.
@therealroseanne Roseanne, I had both knees replaced in 2009 and I still have some problems with them.  But then I am losing bone density all over my body and the meds I need are to expensive for me to take so I have to do without.
@realDonaldTrump Funny thing, the New York Times is still alive and kicking.
@therealroseanne Now, that is the Roseanne I know and love.

@SarahPalinUSA Right to life right up to birth then starve because the GOP want to take the food out of your mouths when they take food stamps from your mother who works very hard to support you but doesn't make enough to cover every thing.

@realDonaldTrump So, when are you going to get Mexico to pay for the wall?   I don't want my tax dollar to cover it.   I prefer that my taxes go to helping the poor instead of building that blasted wall.  Illegal's will find a way to cross the border whether there is a wall or not.
@SarahPalinUSA But, if Gun's don't kill, then Bombs don't kill!1!!!!!

@jcdwms @Shecky60 @JimCarrey Our first amendment rights were written by man, not god.
@jcdwms @Shecky60 @JimCarrey A person can claim to be a Christian but a true Christian wants to change and be more Christ like once accepting Jesus as his or her savior.  You mean to tell me that Jesus was a childish baby the way Trump is?  HUMMMMMMMMMMM  I guess what I was taught in bible school was a lie.
@jcdwms @JimCarrey It certainly isn't what Trump thinks either.   What does the bible say about divorce and how to treat others?
@realDonaldTrump My gut feeling tells me you fired a lot of people just before they were set to retire, just so you wouldn't have to pay them retirement.  Shame on you.
@TrumpStore @jimmykimmel Products MADE IN CHINA but CHARGED AMERICAN PRICES.   WOW  I thought Trump was all about "MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN" but yet, he is making CHINA GREAT BY HAVING THEM MAKE HIS PRODUCTS.  TRAITOR TO AMERIC, IS TRUMP AND FAMILY.
@SarahPalinUSA Not actually for Sarah, it is for https://t.co/g7QbuCzP1Q I am qualified to speak my mind, you know, the FIRST AMENDMENT!
@Texassenorita @SarahPalinUSA My boys had a roof over their head, clothes on their backs and food in their belly.  I scratched and saved to buy a TV for them to watch.. I rode a bus to work.  I had to live close to a grocery store so I could walk.  I know what hard work for little pay is.
@Texassenorita @SarahPalinUSA What labor work do you do?  What job do you stand on your feet for 8 hours.  I am 71 years old and had to raise my two boys on any job I could get.  In the 70's the minimum wage was to much to get more than $20 a month food stamps so I just didn't apply.
@Texassenorita @SarahPalinUSA OH, and I believe you are also motivated by your hatred of OBAMA who is considered the nasty black man who graced the white house, by a lot of republican supporters.
@Texassenorita @SarahPalinUSA Then why don't you tell us the things he has accomplished.   The poor do the hard labor but get very little pay.  It is SLAVE LABOR!  They make enough to put a roof over their heads and most are WORKING WOMEN with CHILDREN.  Now the GOP want to take the food out of those mouths.
@Texassenorita @SarahPalinUSA LOL, he worked hard at getting rid of someone who spoke their mind when they thought they could contribute to a better decision.  WOW, dunce.
@Texassenorita @SarahPalinUSA How many does that make, 3, 4, maybe?  There are millions out there who need help.  3 and 4 don't make it.
@realDonaldTrump Any time you have to fire as many people as you have had to fire in the last year, there is CHAOS in the White House.   It is good to have people to disagree with you.  Sometimes it helps you make the right decision.
@EricTrump @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson FAUX News (FOX if you didn't know what the FAUX news is) is the NEWS which spews out false news all the time.  Just watch and then some times they have to retract, you know, like Jimmy Carters Death reported last November?

@Texassenorita @SarahPalinUSA Rosemary, if he loved the American People he would have already done things to help all, not just those who all ready have.  Don't try to tell me he loves the poor because he doesn't.  The poor are the ones who do all the strenuous work for little money.

@politico TRUMP WAS TO  YELLOW BELLIED to join the military and go to Vietnam. Claimed he had a bone spur.  Well I had a bone spur, (scar to prove it) on my right foot in the late 60's.  It was removed in day surgery.  Never came back.
@CNN LOL, he was to scared to join the military and go to Vietnam OHHHHHH poor baby had a bone spur.  I also had one about the same time and I had it removed in day surgery.   Nothing to it.  Trump is a YELLOW BELLY CHICKEN.
@washingtonpost If he was to scared to join the military and go to war in Vietnam, he would not have gone into that school.  He would have resorted to the bone spur again.  Bone spur's are nothing, I had one removed from my right foot in day surgery so I should know.
@politico You are full of shit.  You didn't have the nerve to join the military and go to Vietnam.  A bone spur kept the poor baby out of war.  A bone spur in the 60's could be removed in day surgery with no problems.  I know, I had one removed.

@bender_string5 The Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act of 1994, more commonly known as the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, expired in 2004. It banned the manufacture or importation of certain semi-automatic firearms that it defined as "semiautomatic assault weapons,"
@bender_string5 By U.S. Army definition, a selective-fire rifle chambered for a cartridge of intermediate power. If applied to any semi-automatic firearm regardless of its cosmetic similarity to a true assault rifle, the term is incorrect. Assault Weapon. Any weapon used in an assault (see WEAPO
@bender_string5 It defined the rifle type of assault weapon as a semiautomatic firearm with the ability to accept a detachable magazine and two or more of the following: a folding or telescoping stock. a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon. a bayonet mount.
@bender_string5 Assault weapon is a term used in the United States to define some types of firearms. The definition varies among regulating jurisdictions, but usually includes semi-automatic firearms with a detachable magazine and a pistol grip, and sometimes other features such as a flash s
@bender_string5 Do you know who the "crazy" people are?  Some don't look are sound crazy.   I consider anyone who wants to have an assault weapon for hunting is crazy.   And yes, a semi-automatic weapon is an assault weapon.
@bender_string5 The more reason those weapons need to be taken off the streets.  If you want to shoot them then join the military and go to war.  That is what they are for.
@bender_string5 Yes, and anything that can destroy a child should be taken off the streets.
@bender_string5 Yes, and both should be taken off the streets and market.  The more you talk about murder weapons the worse you make it.
@bender_string5 There you go again with the childish name calling.    So childish and need to grow up.
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/HkqwzOarvA
https://t.co/HkqwzOarvA
@bender_string5 Trump is already calling for the ban on bump stock, so yes, there is something I can do about it.  I will just stay on his case about semi-automatic and automatic weapons.

@bender_string5 You origanally said semi-automatics and automatics weren't legal then changed what you said just as the LIAR Trump does.

@ironpublius @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump LOL, getting closer and closer to Donald Junior and that son n law.  Collusion, collusion, collusion of the Trump campaign.  That isn't saying that Trump himself colluded.
@bender_string5 Yeah, but how many and how fast does the bottom one shoot?   I say ALL semi-automatic and automatics should be taken off the streets.

@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Trump is such a hypocrite.  This is all publicity for him.
@bender_string5 @WhiteHouse Proved you wrong about the AR-15 but you seem to still want to believe the lie that semi-automatic and automatic weapons are illegal to buy.  The kid that did the killing in Florida was born in Florida.
@bender_string5 @WhiteHouse AR-15's are not antique.  In some states it is legal (such as Florida) for a 19 year old to buy an AR-15 semi-automatic weapon where in the same state they can't buy hand guns.
@bender_string5 @WhiteHouse Guess I proved you wrong when you say it is illegal to own an automatic weapon when you said you own a AR-15 which I know is a semi-automatic weapon easily transformed into an automatic rifle.

@bender_string5 @WhiteHouse Though it can be used for hunting, the AR-15 isn't really a hunting rifle. Its standard .223 caliber ammunition doesn't offer much stopping power for anything other than small game. ... A hunter does not need a semi-automatic rifle to hunt, if he does he sucks, and should go play
@bender_string5 @WhiteHouse GUESS WHAT The modern sporting rifle, based on the AR-15 platform, is widely misunderstood. ... They are today's modern sporting rifle. The AR in “AR-15” rifle stands for ArmaLite rifle, after the company that developed it in the 1950s.

@bender_string5 @WhiteHouse If those guns are illegal then how did that mentally ill 19 year old get his hands on a gun that could shoot 52 rounds?   Guess what, George Bush and the Republican congress let the laws that Clinton signed into law, lapse in G.W.B's first term as president so the guns are legal.

@HuffPost Why would we need people from Norway?  They have good government, your "shithole countries" don't and need our help.
@realDonaldTrump Unfortunately most people are being fooled in believing the tax cut is good.  In 2019, they are going to discover they are going to have to pay in more taxes than ever before because they didn't have the time to look at what their taxes should be.
@realDonaldTrump You need to grow up and get out of that kindergarden sandbox.  You tend to throw your friends to the wild dogs.  WOW, I am so glad I am not a friend of yours and that I have never met you.
@HardballChris @MichaelWolffNYC @hardball Because it isn't a work of fiction!
@realDonaldTrump LOL and you said the Collusion thingy was of the past.  LOL, fooled you, didn't he.
@realDonaldTrump Where is your compassion?  It certainly isn't with young people who actually grew up in the U.S.
@Soaper55 @realDonaldTrump You wish, don't you Debra.  It will be the Trumps who go down, down, down.   Seems the younger trump committed treason and so did the son in law
@realDonaldTrump same thing happened just before the crash of the market in 1929 and again in 2008.
@realDonaldTrump Donald, grow up, you of all people tell more lies than anyone on the face of the earth.  WOW
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/wIGq8gXJUX
@realDonaldTrump LOL, it has not been proven that it is a total hoax.  They are still working on it.  Your son and Son-n-law just might end up in prison.
@realDonaldTrump Wow, you really come down on your friends who helped get you elected, don't you?
@realDonaldTrump You can eat anything you want even if your doctor has said it was bad for you, then you go to the doctor to fix the problem caused by what you eat.  A person who is over weight and has diabetes eats like a bird and then loses insurance they had under Obamacare.

@realDonaldTrump The reason for the the transfer to other delivery services was because of the length of time it took for the post office to deliver.  Fedex and UPS started offering next day service and USPS had to follow.  HENSE the cost of USPS went up but the prices they charged didn't.
@realDonaldTrump WOW, just WOW The post office charging more will just run more and more people to Amazon, Fedex and any other delivery service.

@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews WOW, and you used money from your charity to fund your run for president.  Hypocrite.
@realDonaldTrump OH Crap, the tax cut isn't popular except with those that make over 250,000 a year.
⚡️ “Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's engagement photos are here 💍”		https://t.co/ZjQMly8sj7    Harry could easily be my son.  He favors my older son.  My mothers family came from England.
@politico Yeah, they will be fooled until the tax increases hit them either in 2019 or 2020.
@realDonaldTrump Yes and like in 2008 we are heading for another recession where people will have to be thrown out of their homes because they can't make the mortgage payment.  I was lucky to be able to file bankruptcy in 2009 after having surgery on my knees and being let go by where I worked.
@realDonaldTrump What do you call great?  An all White America.  I don't because it was blacks from Africa that helped make America Great.
@Thomorerancher1 @SarahPalinUSA Trump is the one who spews racist crap.  I don't believe in Santa Clause, never have never will.  I didn't even teach my boy's about Santa Clause.  I believe in Jesus Christ and what his beatitudes stand for.

@realDonaldTrump @SecretaryAcosta @USDOL Unemployment is always at it's lowest in Dec. when part timers are hired for shoppers.  It will all change when your tax changes take place and those who do the most shopping, (makes 30, to 100,000 a year) lose their money in tax increases.

@Thomorerancher1 @SarahPalinUSA what racism?  Trump has spewed more racism crap than anyone in the U.S. yet those on the right worship him as if he were their god.   That is why the white supremist are so much for Trump.  I know this because my oldest son became one and is extremely racist.  He worships Trump.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews You mean verses the lies that spew out of both sides of your mouth?  WOW, a liar (Kettle namely you) calling the pot black doesn't suit you.
