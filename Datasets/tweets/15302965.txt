@JAYk1226 and if you must ask congress to raise a debt to fund your priorities you must negotiate.  And ask, by definition, is just that.
@JAYk1226 there is no legal responsibility to approve additional debt for a president and congress who has refused to deal with rising debt
President Obama and Congress ought to remember that Democracies are built on compromise and negotiation not unilateral decree.

The #sotu speech is an arrogant "we know what's best for you" approach to governing.
His speech attempts to bolster his administration's agenda even in light of rejection at the ballot box and obvious public trepidation #sotu
From a political perspective the #sotu does not even pivot the Obama agenda, and barely acknowledges public sentiment against it.
I am thoroughly discouraged by the President's State of the Union address. I expected more, much more.
Prez:"I will not stop trying to change the tone of our politics" oh by the way this is all Bush's fault and the GOP is obstructing me. #sotu
So the Prez wants to make politics less divisive in one sentence, the next sentence he blames the GOP. Sounds like politics as usual #sotu
Prez says Supreme court decision will "open the flood gates for special interests" #sotu
"To do our work openly..." sounds exactly like all the special deals that were made behind closed doors for the health care bill #sotu
Oh...now I get it...the spending freeze will take effect next year....so spend now, spend freely.
It is a crime apparently to make over $250k #sotu
No President walks in the door in "easy" times, Mr. President. Your predecessor, within his first 9 months in office had 9/11 #sotu
"All of this was before I walked in the door.." At what point does Obama take responsibility? #sotu
Walk away! Walk away! Run away! #sotu
the #sotu makes me feel like I am in bizarro world... apparently the #sotu Chamber is a vortex of sensational thinking and fuzzy math
"Choose a competitive health care plan...?" No! More like force every American to buy a Gov't sanctioned HC plan. #sotu
Government workers get yet another perk- student loan forgiveness...yet another disgusting disincentive to go into the private sector #sotu
So much for private sector innovation Union #sotu
Government workers get yet another perk- student loan forgiveness...yet another disgusting disincentive to go into the private sector
Race to the Top is almost as bad as No Child Left Behind as far as I am concerned Union #sotu
Prez touts Race to the Top plan for education...he endorses school choice but only choice between government schools...not private ones
Obama apparently supports fair trade not necessarily free trade Union #sotu
Whenever the whole audience in congress gets excited and claps, I get nervous Union #sotu
RT @DougBenson: Obama is killing with slightly more than half the crowd. #SotU
Wow! Offshore oil and gas development and nuclear energy. Props to the Prez! Union #sotu
"How long should America put its future on hold?" Not long at all. But the future American's want doesn't include expansive government #sotu
Put more Americans to work, yet again, sounds like government employees Union #sotu
Everyone agrees on eliminating capital gains taxes for small businesses Union #sotu
"Jobs must be our number one focus in 2010.. I am calling on a new job bill".. probably government jobs that feed off taxpayers. Union #sotu
All of the strides Prez talks about sound very conservative: tax cuts etc Union #sotu
We cut taxes and we cut taxes and we cut taxes...and we spent more money....
RT @kathrynlopez: at least joe and nancy and michelle and harry are color coordinated
"I proposed a fee on the biggest banks..." AKA I am keen on taxing the biggest fish because it is politically easy to do Union #sotu
"Unemployment might be double without the bailout..." Prove it. 	Union #sotu
"We all hated the bank bail out..." Well why did you vote for it and sign it...?
Can't argue with the Prez so far, America's spirit is resilient and strong Union #sotu
Top of the #sotu is all about struggling Americans...what has congress done to help with those economic woes? Try to pass Gov't HC?
Obama calls for partisanship to by cast aside Union #sotu
#sotu I wonder if Joe Wilson has duct tape on his mouth?
#sotu Obama took office in such a tumultuous time.. "The worst of the storm has past but the devastation remains"...referring to economy
I wish Hillary were attending the #sotu, she is missed... ;)
Obama's #sotu should focus on the economy, job creation and the like. We shall see..
Obama's #sotu should be interested. Expect blame to be placed on the Bush admin and GOP
Michelle Obama looks great at the #sotu
Ok
@brookr Corporations are collections of individuals, that is really all they are, so their speech should be protected accordingly.
@carlosdavis @jasonedelman haha! true I slept through key games but I want to redeem myself this year and can't choose between mens / mixed
@brookr I am an opponent of activist courts, but I think this decision was constitutional. Free speech includes freedom to spend your money
@whitscott can you play on a mens and mixed team at Paga or are you limited to just one or the other?

Supreme Court made a good decision to overturn campaign spending limits. Citizens and business should be able to spend their $ as they like.
Good work today Supreme Court.
Americans seem to be rejecting the we-know-what's-best-for-you, "whether you like it our not" dictatorial political edicts coming from DC
@mollypalooza Oh yeah they are, interesting is an understatement!

#CAstateofstate guv calls on the legislature to work as a team for CA. Idealistic. Yes. Sentimental. Realistic. No.

#CAstateofstate Private prisons, that is a great idea, hard to accomplish with public employee union opposition though
#CAstateofstate guv has a point, we put too much money into CA prisons
#CAstateofstate a great way for guv to protect education is encourage use of private schools
#CAstateofstate here we go...budget overview!!
