@Donna71540867 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump That’s not entirely true. Also...Insurance doesn’t typically pay for contraception.  Keep in mind that every state has different rules regarding access to contraceptives.  You are fortunate to have had a health care provider who would always happily prescribe you birth control.
@Donna71540867 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Every (R) admin since 1980 has cut funding for actual birth control.  Look it up.  Makes no sense.

@jonswaine Bill Mitchell too....whoever he is.
@dworms86 @Rhiannon224 @marypankiw @JYSexton @fakegimel I am not okay with that behavior.  I find it abhorrent.  That being said, it is a far cry from sending someone explosive devices intended to maim and murder.

@Micwritermcleod @TitusNation Oregon is the same way.  But....no disrespect here....You know this isn’t a primary, right??
@tedcruz Civil like how last night you said Beto could share a cell with Hillary?  YOU are part of the problem.

@dangainor @Pattie79149997 @GOP Bullshit.

@dangainor You don’t get to have it both ways.
@sahluwal He’s not going to say anything. It’s all good because they’re his opposition.
@stephens_ben @wvjoe911 Just makes me sad. They want it both ways.  They want to be able to say these things and then turn around and call for civility from the other side.
@bellat1999 @wvjoe911 Sad, isn’t it. Just saying whatever will froth up the rabid ignorance most.
@realDonaldTrump You’re lying.
@WalshFreedom Bullshit.
@Bettysp71345 @MommaJacy @YesSirJames Just seems like such a bad idea to have the guy who is running for office also controlling the election.
@kylegriffin1 Shocker.
@WalshFreedom Bullshit.
@MommaJacy @YesSirJames Right??!!
@SassyKadiK Brainwashed cult members. It’s scary really
@lindeeloo_who They want to have it both ways.  Same way they believe that a bunch of weak minded women and beta male snowflakes can also be a dangerous angry mob.  Whatever fits their narrative.
@stucam7771 Fear.

@BillKristol I just want to see class and civility return. We should be better than this.
@GovHowardDean Love this idea!!! Oregon has done this for years.  Gives you time to think about your vote.
@MarcBrodyreal @canna_kelly @FoxNewsResearch We were talking about deficit trends.  You take issue with the ten trillion. I get that. It’s a shocking number. I take issue with it as well. But if you are only able to accept “alternative facts” spoon fed to you, and “blame it on the black guy” i’ll say it again: you bore me.
@MarcBrodyreal @canna_kelly @FoxNewsResearch The false narrative? You’re getting off topic. Never once said Obama wasn’t a war monger; I do not advocate for war. It is the bloody archaic means of the wealthy to profit at the cost of young lives. That being said, which admin took out Bin Laden? Seems that is worth some price
@retail_recruit @richardseverin1 @CoreyStewartVA Nope.  They don’t.
@funder He’s not a moron.
@MarcBrodyreal Fact:  one of the first things Obama did was to put the war on the books.  Made his numbers look terrible.  Again...math not so much your strong suit?
@MarcBrodyreal @FoxNewsResearch Duh. Trump got handed the lowest deficit in a decade. Did you not just read the fox news thingy they just posted??  You bore me ‘cause you’re slow, Jethro.  Catch up.
@MarcBrodyreal Fact: George W Bush did not include the Iraq war in his budget.
@MarcBrodyreal @FoxNewsResearch You bore me.
@MarcBrodyreal @FoxNewsResearch About half of that was booking W’s previously UNFUNDED IRAQ WAR. Plus GWB handed him a crashed market and an exponential deficit trend....your very own Fox shows how he decreased that trend.  What’s your Boy Trump spending the new 1.9 trillion on? Is it you? Are you the 1%?
@MarcBrodyreal @FoxNewsResearch So.  It is the defecit that adds to the debt, is it not??
@tribelaw How about logic and truth
@MarcBrodyreal @FoxNewsResearch Ummmmm.....I am thinking you might not understand the way math works.
@JanzforCongress @LillianVikingDK Some of us have worked for everything we have.  Still have some student debt myself.
@tab_beene @braxtonryn @FoxNewsResearch Ummmmm....really??  You do know how math works, right?
@tab_beene @SirHardHarry @FoxNewsResearch @realDonaldTrump Sweet Jesus you people are dense.  Wtf are you even saying?
@FoxNewsResearch So basically then....Obama got it way down and Trump’s balooning it up. Cool.

@TheAtlantic @zakijam So sad.
@ajmeader Yup. To the privileged, equality feels like oppression.
@goodoldcatchy I fully agree. Everyone’s a critic in the age of the interwebs. It is so very easy to do. My Dad would say, “There’s no talent in being a critic.” The Internet has shown us that we can pick anyone, anything, any statement apart.  Better to be positive. Better to act!

@karenireland16 @tarheel5423 @SenatorCollins Hah.  This was so far from due process, it’s criminal. And at least I can spell.
@tarheel5423 @karenireland16 @SenatorCollins That’s how ignorant you have to be to believe this bullshit.
@SenatorCollins Well. Guess you have served your purpose.  You disgust me that you would appoint that lying partisan monster to a lifetime position on the highest court of our nation. You are a disgrace.
@real_farmacist No shit.
@ASlavitt He’s not worried about the midterms because he knows Russia will fix them up for him.
@darsuec @jdawsey1 It utterly makes no sense.
@jdawsey1 @joshtpm Not really....did he?
@NefertitiVerita @mswjeff @rgoodlaw Lol.  Hmmmm....now that you mention it, his skin tone was kinda blotchy red.
@mswjeff @rgoodlaw Except he wasn’t even drunk.
@AnAdGuy @madasednam @coleyworld @BrettKavanaugh Yeah. Wow.
@AynRandPaulRyan @OrrinHatch It is time for him to go. He is an ugly old man with antiquated ideas.
@MrsRabbitResist I hate it. Everything is simplified to a binary argument starting with whether you’re a D or an R.
@tribelaw If he is confirmed it is a serious setback.
@Owenamy @Dasein90 @mmfa @benshapiro Thanks.
@rolandscahill Yep. He is.
@SoulStealer25 Whyyyy?
@BiasedGirl WTF.  No. Just no.
@Owenamy @Dasein90 @mmfa @benshapiro Who wrote that?
@leeleeb50 He’s their demi-god. He’s their savior.  He can do NO wrong in their eyes.

@David_Swanson @BradMossEsq @nytimes @realDonaldTrump Prolly just ONE reason why he didn’t.

@kevinrudy @SarahWFin @thomaskaine5 It is like the twilight zone to be sure.  WHO SAYS THAT at all, Let alone a world leader.

@HandsomeRandy2 @dddfaber @deckacards @Voter_2018 @snowbunnyCdn @PeterAlexander @naretevduorp correct. I have lost my sense of humor. It is not funny how this was handled, and it is my opinion that YOU are the one who should be feeling shame. That man is an entitled monster. It is clear that You and I will never agree on this point and that is okay.  Have a nice life.
@HandsomeRandy2 @dddfaber @deckacards @Voter_2018 @snowbunnyCdn @PeterAlexander @naretevduorp They kept Scalia’s seat open for over 400 days. So yeah. Dude needs to come clean... https://t.co/2r3joi7aId

@HandsomeRandy2 @DrEricStrong @dddfaber @deckacards @Voter_2018 @snowbunnyCdn @PeterAlexander @naretevduorp Hmmmm....so you are faulting Ms. Feinstein for following Senate rules and respecting the privacy of the alleged victim.

@HandsomeRandy2 @dddfaber @deckacards @Voter_2018 @snowbunnyCdn @PeterAlexander @naretevduorp Jury’s still out until ALL witnesses and allegations are heard. It would be madness to convict or acquit based on the testimony of the accused alone.
@HandsomeRandy2 @dddfaber @deckacards @Voter_2018 @snowbunnyCdn @PeterAlexander @naretevduorp So you have heard one side of the story and you are ready to go?
@HandsomeRandy2 @dddfaber @deckacards @Voter_2018 @snowbunnyCdn @PeterAlexander @naretevduorp And I only want it one way. An official FBI investigation into ALL the allegations against him.  The alleged victims are all willing to testify under oath. Why not the alleged perp? Clear his “fine reputation”
@HandsomeRandy2 @dddfaber @deckacards @Voter_2018 @snowbunnyCdn @PeterAlexander @naretevduorp Investigated by whom?
@HandsomeRandy2 @dddfaber @deckacards @Voter_2018 @snowbunnyCdn @PeterAlexander @naretevduorp You don’t get to have it both ways.
@Janet4OH Yes! County over Party.
@amvetsupport @HollywoodNobody He’s MORE than a man to them.  More Like a demi-god...
@HandsomeRandy2 @dddfaber @deckacards @Voter_2018 @snowbunnyCdn @PeterAlexander @naretevduorp It is too their job.  This is the FEDERAL SUPREME COURT we are talking about, not Baltimore Middle School.  Sooo....for clarity: you’re super okay with calling her a liar without investigation, but those who question whether he’s a fine man from a fine family are EVIL?
@Snowflake_Blitz @joanwalsh I read somewhere:  “To the privileged, equality feels like oppression.”
@HandsomeRandy2 @dddfaber @deckacards @Voter_2018 @snowbunnyCdn @PeterAlexander @naretevduorp You are in favor of the FBI investigating this then?

@aroguegardener @nloquendi @The_John_Powers @neeratanden @realDonaldTrump That is pretty astute, I think.  I agree.  It is self-protecting to hold that viewpoint.
@TeaPainUSA Seems legit.
@FaceLikeTheSun @MollyJongFast @tedcruz @adamcurry @THErealDVORAK Yeah. Most folks like their own comfortable opinions.  I imagine I’ve got plenty of those myself.
@HollywoodNobody Apparently no one.
@MusiciansCaring @DonaldJTrumpJr 😂🤣😂🤣. Yeah. He did say EXACTLY that.
@FaceLikeTheSun @MollyJongFast @tedcruz @adamcurry @THErealDVORAK I’ll check them out.  Twitter definitely displays all sides of an argument.  As long as someone doesn’t threaten me with kidnapping, torture and death simply because my opinion differs from theirs, I am pretty okay with hearing what both sides (or all six sides) have to say.
@HollywoodNobody Oh yes.  Let’s. That would be freaking HILARIOUS.
@FaceLikeTheSun @MollyJongFast @tedcruz I don’t actually watch the tv news. I haven’t the stomach for all that.
@nloquendi @The_John_Powers @neeratanden @realDonaldTrump So true. One lady on that jury said, “MY granddaughter is 11.  She would NEVER let this happen to her.  It’s not normal. She would run screaming from the room.”  She BLAMED an 11 year old girl for some creeper crawling into her very own bed at night.  Breaks my heart.
@The_John_Powers @neeratanden @nloquendi @realDonaldTrump They make excuses for the bad behavior. So yeah, it happened....but it was not his fault.  Boys will be boys.  Maybe this, maybe that.  Even, “Who bought the alcohol??” She shouts in the end.
@neeratanden @davidmweissman I was on a hung jury of a sex abuse case. Dude was “Mom’s Friend”; Victim was an 11 year old girl. The 5 men and I voted to convict the man. The six women voted to acquit. Their primary rationale? “Girls lie about such things.” (I live in a county that voted 67% for Trump.)
@FaceLikeTheSun @MollyJongFast @tedcruz Talking about race is not racism.
@FaceLikeTheSun @MollyJongFast @tedcruz First off, race relations are not a binary argument; very few issues are. I absolutely agree that Fox News created propaganda in this story by including the detail of the marijuana. They know their audience.  Fox knows how to profit by putting fear in their hearts and minds.
@RockOlaRaider @julievzwilson @MollyJongFast @jmkhill2004 @tedcruz Rotten at the core, I imagine.
@FaceLikeTheSun @MollyJongFast @tedcruz The line about the marijuana would have NEVER appeared in an article about a white person. Race is a factor here.
@julievzwilson @MollyJongFast @jmkhill2004 @tedcruz What kind of person must he be  to have his family come out so publicly against him like this?  Woof.

@they_cant_win @ReaIDonnaSiciIy @CajunRaz @catwiit @madmady69 @freddyatton @lordjohnalldis1 @realDonaldTrump Never once did I mention theMiddle East, people in their homes, etc.  Just simply the ACTUAL WORDS out of Trump’s mouth.  One lie of many many many many of his lies.
@they_cant_win @ReaIDonnaSiciIy @CajunRaz @catwiit @madmady69 @freddyatton @lordjohnalldis1 @realDonaldTrump He’s on video saying it. Also Super Classy to wish me dead because you lost this argument.

@they_cant_win @ReaIDonnaSiciIy @CajunRaz @catwiit @madmady69 @freddyatton @lordjohnalldis1 @realDonaldTrump Wow. No kiddin’?? THOUSANDS and THOUSANDS celebrating??

@PDXAngie I made the argument with a guy the other day that based on his anti-abortion logic of bodily protection of life, he would think that mandated blood and organ donations would be a great idea.  Once he’s a match, it would be HIS body saving a life. He didn’t much care for that. 😊

I’m sure a number of those men would have given that guys kudos for executing those murdering women. Just sayin’.
@AmyAtrebas @DTOMmom4 @tkwolfe1 @ghostant @FarleyDavenport @perlmutations I am dumbfounded by them. the disconnect of logic: being anti-abortion, but also anti-contraception and anti-comprehensive sex-ed. It boggles my mind. “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure”. Teach children prevention and you could virtually eliminate abortion.
@AmyAtrebas @DTOMmom4 @tkwolfe1 @ghostant @FarleyDavenport @perlmutations She probably thinks this guy was a hero.
@YeahYeahGoMe @logicalvulcan @OhNoSheTwitnt It’s kind of terrifying.
@mtfinnegan @OhNoSheTwitnt Pro-birth
@Quel_the_hell @OhNoSheTwitnt Pro-birth.
@logicalvulcan @OhNoSheTwitnt NOT funny.
@JNelsonLDF @Sifill_LDF So so true.
@SocialPowerOne1 Well of course it didn’t.
@TinaFL @marcorubio God hates a coward Marco. God hates a coward.
@coco_konski @real_farmacist Is that legal?
@JoshDoohen @perlmutations And I get that pregnancy can be prevented. Which takes me back to my first question...IT DOES MATTER: Do you support comprehensive sex-ed and easy access to birth control? If not...well then, again, you are simply pro-birth, NOT pro-life.
@JoshDoohen @perlmutations But, Your intentions would be irrelevant once it was known that you were a matched donor. At that point, it would be YOU and YOUR BODY alone who could either end or save that man’s life.  Just seems to me that maybe you ought to have a choice in how your body gets used.
@JohnFugelsang Love this!
@JoshDoohen @perlmutations It’s your argument dude....ALL life deserves protection.
@JoshDoohen @perlmutations If you have a kidney that will save your neighbor and you don’t give it...he died because of your selfishness.
@JoshDoohen @perlmutations Life is life.
@ghostant Wow! Why is the bread green??
@benFranklin2018 LOVE!
@JoshDoohen @perlmutations Have you tested and registered to donate your kidney or bone marrow? Based on your logic here, perhaps we should mandate blood and organ donation. I mean if the guy down the street needs a kidney and you have the match to save him, you better step up to save his dignified life.
@JoshDoohen @perlmutations No. It DOES matter. If you think society should protect precious life, but you do not support the things I listed, then you are NOT “pro-life”. If af the moment that those precious lives pop out, you say, “well kid, you’re on your own, have a nice life”, you are simply pro-birth.
@tkwolfe1 @ThomasMacIsaac1 @ghostant @AmyAtrebas @FarleyDavenport @perlmutations What is OP?
@ThomasMacIsaac1 @tkwolfe1 @ghostant @AmyAtrebas @FarleyDavenport @perlmutations What is condescending??

@KING5Seattle It was a truly excellent rendition.

@ghostant @AmyAtrebas @tkwolfe1 @FarleyDavenport @perlmutations True story.
@JesseFFerguson This is what guilty people do.
@JennisonNeal @perlmutations They’re also the same people, who despite the evidence push abstinence only sex-ed, are sanctimoniously anti-birth control, anti-maternity health care, anti-maternity leave, anti CHIP....you know, when I think about it, they’re anti-women &amp; children really.
@ALT_uscis @AP Because he’s guilty.  Guilty guilty guilty!
@Davey28car @Purpleswordpur3 @AmyAtrebas @tkwolfe1 @FarleyDavenport @perlmutations Go fuck yourself.
@atDavidHoffman @possumpig Um...yeah. Obviously.
@JoshDoohen @perlmutations Then you’re a BIG supporter of sex-ed, cheap accessible birth control, maternity insurance, paid maternity leave, CHIP, free lunch at school and all that?? NAH. I bet here you’ll scream, “Personal responsibility! I won’t “pay” for your choices! Keep your legs closed you sluts!”
@FarleyDavenport @perlmutations True statement because you sure cannot call these folks “pro-life”.

@JonSpreainde @SamuelFerris7 @SarahPalinUSA This makes me smile. I hope you have a wonderful day. Keep up the good fight!
@JonSpreainde @SamuelFerris7 @SarahPalinUSA But you’re right. It’s petty. In honor of you and my mother I will clean up my act. :)
@JonSpreainde @SamuelFerris7 @SarahPalinUSA As a rule...spelling errors are not humorous and I dislike grammar nazis. This one tho...idk. Maybe it was late, maybe it was beer.....maybe it’s just my Karama (🤣) and the fact that the user of said word will NOT get my comment one teensy tiny little bit that amused me.
@JonSpreainde @SamuelFerris7 @SarahPalinUSA Jesus. You sound like my mother. I GET IT. But I also REFUSE to lose my sense of humor through all this. Palin is irrelevant, and at any rate, we are on the same side here, my brother, but you want to waste your breath on me being flippant. Go pick a fight with someone else.

@LiberalPolitico @BillKristol Lol. Ain’t that the truth!
@WalshFreedom The conversation needs to STOP being about defining ourselves by party. The conversation needs to be about defining ourselves as Americans by the Constitution.
@JohnnyBlkshrt A guy was making the argument that the Lewinski BJ was a less consensual act than Trump’s pussy grabbing. I would not concede that point; He said he provided me with facts, said I reminded him of “a dog eating its own shit”, &amp; if replied to him, he would report ME for harassment.
@richardhine What an oaf! Embarrassing.
@coffee_minion @richardhine He doesn’t have a shred of shame.

@CharlesMBlow Opportunists.
@MrFilmkritik But they won’t.
@jdoublesquared @socalledsaul @Shirleyann27 @WalshFreedom Monica, the beautiful victim. I’d ACTUALLY say that was FAR MORE consensual than grabbing some chick I don’t know between the legs and ramming my tongue down her freaking throat. (Also, “proven rapist”? Big words. You wanna supply a source other than Alex Jones for that)
@Shirleyann27 @socalledsaul @WalshFreedom Based on my training and experience, only the sickest fucks outwardly brag about their crimes, which is precisely what your “boy” did. Oh...and *NEWSFLASH* in case you missed it, Clinton hasn’t been president for like 18 years now. Sad that all you have is a long dead argument.
@socalledsaul @Shirleyann27 @WalshFreedom Funny. Great point too! And last I checked, intern or not, that blowjob was a consensual act.  I bet dollars to donuts a lot of those pussies wish so much that they could return to their former “ungrabbed” states.
@Shirleyann27 @socalledsaul @WalshFreedom Yeah. Maybe....But none on tape braggin’ in his own words about how awesome it is to be grabbin’ those pussies.

@josh119872 @Stephen69054196 @davidmweissman @donlemon @KingJames @BarackObama You know....You’re trying to have a rational conversation with a “Q” truth believer.  🙄As far as I can tell, belief in that nonsense is positively schizophrenic and folks with Mental illness have very little ability for rational thought.

@marcorubio For the love of all that is actually holy, just resign and go be a preacher. You are clearly ill suited for politics.
@possumpig It is mental and as best as I can tell, goes: “Dark to light, learn the truth...The lord and savior DJT is being framed by about 90% of the world’s leaders who are also evil child trafficking pedophiles. Oh, and JFK. And the #17.” Then again, I only spent about 5 min reading.
@possumpig Schizophrenic conspiracy theory.
@CraigCaplan @SharonCoryell3 $250 million is PEANUTS!
@CraigCaplan Of course. NOW they play the “fiscal responsibility” card.
@shaines12 @AltUSPressSec @jack @Twitter @facebook As best as I can tell, it appears to be a schizophrenic conspiracy theory wherein the lord and savior DJT is being framed by 90% of the world’s leaders who are all evil child trafficking pedophiles. (Also it places some unknown significance on JFK and oddly enough, the number 17)
@RealMuckmaker That’s a whole lotta angry white folk. **Note how the “blacks for Trump” made sure their signs covered their faces.**
@_forlorn_hope @migueld10010 @NBCNews Ummmm...they want a threat assessment to see IF he is compromising national security BY using his personal phone. So.....you kinda just made my argument. &amp;Thanks for the lively debate without calling names. :)
@_forlorn_hope @migueld10010 @NBCNews Well. A superquick cursory google search and I find headlines stating EXACTLY that he uses a personal phone from the following: Time, The Hill, ABC, NBC, CNN, Politico, USA Today, Washington Times, Esquire....(I imagine this where you’re going to scream “FakeNews”?)
@SansMerci86 @realDonaldTrump I kinda like Donald Twitler.
@_forlorn_hope @migueld10010 @NBCNews I always forget that the rules don’t apply to him.
@_forlorn_hope @migueld10010 @NBCNews Didn’t say it was. He’s supposed to use the secured line.
@_forlorn_hope @migueld10010 @NBCNews This is such a DEAD argument.  Trump regularly uses his personal cell phone and what was that I read about this admin’s 22,000,000 emails that have gone through private servers....??
@AmandaS15866691 @jimv245 @MarkJKremer @NathanOHaraPhD Dollars to donuts, he won’t have a single citation for any of this. He’ll just call everyone names and say that we’re ignorant. The DT Cult members are all this way.
@CyndiGurley @TimRunsHisMouth Maybe they know something about what it is like to not have basic rights.
@Brandonrowe14 @PattyArquette Wow. Condescend much? Reports show it took some brainiacs like yourself about two hours to hack electronic voting software. I don’t trust it.

@DogginTrump Wanna know what is cool? I live in Oregon where we have mail in paper ballots and DMV voter registration. I am going to sit at my dining room table with a cup of coffee and vote at my leisure.
@krassenstein SHUTUP. He did NOT actually say that?!?
@Slate Is it true that 600,000 Georgia voters were purged from the system shortly before the election?
@MacMcKinseyIV #keepportlandweird
@REDMAN9001 @YouTube Hmmmmm
@realDonaldTrump Idk. Sounds like you’re ripping us off. I suppose it takes a thief to know a thief.
@TitusNation @facebook Hey now....Shrek is a good guy. :)
@alraczko @bigleaguepol Wow. Like...While Trump does the opposite or something?  🤣
@PattyArquette @realDonaldTrump @GOP @RonWyden Proud of my OR Senators. @RonWyden &amp; @JeffMerkley
@CNNPolitics Paper ballots!
@JeffMerkley There are a few. Thanks for representing! #oregonrocks
@agitpopworld @RonWyden @PattyArquette 🤮
@OMGno2trump Wow.
@DogginTrump  https://t.co/a8p96Bf4As
@TrumpStudents @jack Bots, dudes. You were infested with bot.
@emrazz Who the fuck is Ray O’Keefe and why would we give him a tweet’s-worth of time??
@BettyBowers Maybe we are into the re-run season?
@HollywoodNobody My state senator Jeff Merkley is.
@RealMuckmaker @Bennythesnitch Nothing. He’s not worth it.
@JohnFugelsang Brilliant...again...
@DeniLove1906 @Katheri67707560 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Sorry, Ms. “Walks IN Love”....What did I NOT comprehend? You called someone ignorant and told them to choose a different path. And now you question my ability to comprehend reading...does that mean I am stupid?? Just seems an awful funny dichotomy in your philosophy.
@DeniLove1906 @Katheri67707560 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Dear Ms. “Walks With Love”, perhaps you should rethink your “philosophy” and not tell others how to live their life. Just sayin’ it doesn’t seem very loving to me.
@TrueOregon @RonWyden Flawed perhaps, but much less “hackable” than computer votes. Citizenship is verified by the Or DMV. Undocumenteds cannot get an OR license and therefore cannot be registered to vote in OR. Seems like having a national standard would eliminate voting in multiple states.
RT @MillenPolitics: Your vote matters. 		If it didn’t, you wouldn’t have Republicans trying to suppress it. 		If it didn’t, you wouldn’t ha…
@RonWyden ABSOLUTELY!!!  Oregon mail-in ballot voting &amp; DMV voter registration is the BEST!!  I think a national standard needs to happen.
@MarkJKremer Oh. But they are.
@g8orb866 @denise_kandra @mrsdianek @seanhannity Well I disagree. But thanks for the lively debate.
@g8orb866 @denise_kandra @mrsdianek @seanhannity We don’t hand Americans over to hostile powers so they can “talk”. The “McConnell crap” really happened so “spare me” your GOP let’s blame Obama FOR EVERYTHING rhetoric. And let’s use your logic here: this has probably always been going on so whatevs here? Have I got that right?
@Steveeeees @soapboxsteve @thehill Idk...Russian cyberattacks to undermine U.S. democracy seem a lot like a traditional act of war. Trump seems to think it’s a great idea to have Russia help us look into all that. Oh...and then there’s this whole “let Russia interrogate U.S. citizens” thing.
@Steveeeees @thehill Wow. So you’re super okay with treason then? Nice.
@ciassou23 @David_J_Evans78 @CNN @cnnsport I hear Russia is nice. 🇷🇺
@CNN @cnnsport I can’t wait for football.
@g8orb866 @denise_kandra @mrsdianek @seanhannity And WTF is this latest bullshit about handing over American citizens to be interrogated by Russia?? Haven’t had time to make heads or tails of THAT nonsense, but it sure as shit doesn’t sound American.  “Banana Republican” perhaps, but not American.
@Goss30Goss Badge of honor.
@g8orb866 @denise_kandra @mrsdianek @seanhannity Russia Cyberattack to undermine US democracy seems awful close to a traditional act of war. Trump says it’s a fun idea to have Russia look into that for us.🙄 Remember how he called dems treasonous for not appreciating the SOTU? Guess that’s all cool &amp; civil cause he’s YOUR guy?
@denise_kandra @mrsdianek @seanhannity So you’re super okay with treason then?  Nice.
@RuiRodTweeter @THOMASBMALONE @seanhannity @trumps_feed Arugula! Everyone always freaking forgets about the arugula.
@TitusNation Me too
@BravenakBlog @realDonaldTrump These people are so simple...everything must be a binary argument.
@lisakitter @newtgingrich @POTUS Trump’s turned the swamp into a sewer....guess you sewer rats can’t smell it.
@ginageewebby @krassenstein I believe he gives them an easy and socially acceptable way to blame others for their misfortune. There need be no personal accountability for anything, everything wrong in their lives is because of some outside factor...liberals, democrats, immigrants, etc.
@whitehousegift I’d rather not 🤮 while trimming the tree....
@BlueGhost40_ Wow.
@JeffreyGuterman @SharonCoryell3 Everything is simplified to a binary argument with these people. 🙄😳🙄
@marcorubio And your guy was putty in his hands.
@PeterAlexander @SharonCoryell3 Just Barely.
@ManInTheHoody And they’d still give him a “pass”.
@n1845j @timratcliff @kk_kimster4life @brithume Lol. Wow.  So you’re super cool with treason then.
@timratcliff @kk_kimster4life @brithume Wow.  These people??  It’s kind of like EVERYONE now if even Newt Gingrich &amp; Brit Hume are. speaking out.
@ReelDancing @Lesismorre @PinkyDoo08 @realDonaldTrump She’d reply to you, but you used awfully big words
@oscaralozano1 @Kokomothegreat @JonLemire @richardhine 😳😳
@Kokomothegreat @JonLemire @richardhine 😳
@glynngirls @BrinaBrady @deanfv @WalshFreedom Why would you call me lazy? You know nothing about me. Again....what is your amazing source here....one link....one reputable source. You are simply spouting mad conspiracy theory. You pretty much have to discount every news outlet in the world to believe as you do.
@glynngirls @BrinaBrady @deanfv @WalshFreedom Sources? Bet you got nothing past Brietbart and your tin-foil hatted Alex Jones.
@JeffFlake It is! So DO SOMETHING!!!
@1AEDWM @TheMominatrixx @TeenVogue Hahahahaha...did you actually even read that article? A whole lot of superficial NOTHING she has done. ASPIRE to be like her? I think not. There are some fantastic female role models out there. This one, not so much.
@Acosta Well good. That settles it. 🙄
@D_Town_DannyB @hareme2 @SenWarren Well then sir, would you please enlighten us? Would you cite the  impeccable sources to backup your viewpoint? Thanks!
@TitusNation Like their fearless leader, they’re doubling down. They’re sticking to their original narratives.  Trump’s fixing shit. Any problems? Blame the black guy and the woman; tell anyone who disagrees that they’re clueless; call names. Done.
@DuaneSmith5 @D_Town_DannyB @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump WE are there supervisors!  Come on people!!  I thought you said you were Americans!!!
@RexMeridian @D_Town_DannyB @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump 1. Yes. This meeting is unprecedented. There should be an aide...at minimum.  An American verified record, as Blind faith in a leader shows great  ignorance. 2. Nice #civility and #tolerance you show to me, a person with a differing opinion!! Thanks for restoring my faith.
@Jigheadda2 Oh...riiiight.  Let the name calling begin.
@marcorubio Quit your job and go be a preacher already!! You clearly missed your calling going into politics.
@baby_b_a @Kennix1451Nix @D_Town_DannyB @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Well shit! It had no impact?? Guess everything’s just peachy keen then!! Hey...I KNOW....Let’s give them another crack at it....maybe they learned some new tricks last time...practice makes perfect after all.
@Timenem22 @iamLucretiaMott @realDonaldTrump Don’t feed the trolls. 🙂
@realDonaldTrump Those were criminal indictments, not “stories”.
@D_Town_DannyB @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Yeah. Nervous that your guy is selling this nation out in his UNSUPERVISED meeting with the Russian dictator.
@cryborg @JohnFugelsang @BGHeaven He infects everything, yet nothing seems to stick to him.
@2020fight I’m going with D.D. on the first and surprisingly less offensive quote.
@christinawilkie @SharonCoryell3 He’s so f-in’ classy.
@bubbagump324 Wow. Tough choice. But I have to go with the Brits.
@JohnFugelsang Brilliant.
@RobertMaguire_ Oh come on....how is that disrespectful?  🤣
@Q13FOX Doh!
@JeffMerkley No. It is not funny.
@BillKristol Do you really have to ask that question??  I can’t get over how many people are somehow okay with this!!
@DeniseRemy233 @isa97 @camelloma @GeorgeTakei You must have missed the 12 indictments this morning???
@TeaPainUSA Man, you follow this stuff and sum up it up so nicely!
@davidhogg111 #civility
@Stonekettle So true!
@TheRynheart  https://t.co/2HahCiCo5N
@washingtonpost Paper ballots!!
@GirvanSue @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump But that is only because he is a brutal dictator who kills those who dissent. I bet you’d be clapping your hands with glee had the UK protested Obama in such a way. Our essential freedoms (like free speech in this instance) protect us ALL, not just those who agree with us.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Wtf is actually happening in this country??
@arlenemiles @SanWren @perlmutations I’d kinda like to know the 47 he follows.
@Alyssa_Milano It’s like an horrifying echo of the past.
@LouDobbs Not sure I even understand what you’re asking....

@BillKristol Well at least you have the gumption to call it what it is.
@jorg_kitchen @jilltew57 @FoxNews Nope. I didn’t. But for fun let’s use your logic: “by all intents and purposes” you called me clueless and told me I would be imprisoned for my opinions. You therefore must also lack tolerance and character. But I suppose that’s an okay thing to say because I disagreed with YOU.
@DisabledResist All of a sudden, I am getting so many of those things myself.
@JeffFlake Actions speak louder than words.
@stonecold2050 @PattyArquette That old man’s day has passed.
@DanRather Good! Because your earlier post made me cry.
@SenSchumer @GrayMattersTwit You are absolutely correct. Isn’t there something that you can do about that?
@DonaldJTrumpJr Yeeah....no.  No, he’s not.
@REDMAN9001 @YouTube 💀💀💀
@JeffMerkley Integrity?? Surely you jest. Time to Fight fire with fire, I say 🔥
@bridget_joy_ @HollywoodNobody I have a real problem with those who voted for him as the “lesser of two evils” and then looked away....that means you 52% of white women....

@prgalloway26 @jilltew57 @FoxNews Yeah. Me and the rest of the world. We are all dumb as fuck....oh wait...that’s YOU.
@jorg_kitchen @jilltew57 @FoxNews Did I say we live in a totalitarian society, you jackbooted moron?
@MattBiks @FoxNews I wrote that backwards. Double negative. :)
@MattBiks @FoxNews I do not! It’s incredible and a little terrifying how so many Americans are showing blind faith in the current American “President”.
@GeorgeTakei I’d just join them. :)
@jilltew57 @FoxNews Duh. Always accuse others of what you are “secretly” doing. Typical totalitarian tactic. Your guy’s dirty dirty dirty.  Dirty as a Russian bomb.
@FoxNews You people and your blind faith in Trump is TERRIFYING.
@FoxNews This is unacceptable! An unsupervised meeting with Putin?? It is UNPRECEDENTED to not have at least an aide in with them.
@dawnresist @Bornabrit1 @RolndKarl Well I am sorry to the whole freaking world that morons in my country got him elected.
@kylegriffin1 @real_farmacist How does that work?
@BillKristol And yet....here we are.
@morten @realDonaldTrump Awww...but but....FACTS.
@Amy_Siskind By executive order....yeah. It’s only just a little terrifying.
@dawnresist @Bornabrit1 @RolndKarl I’m not sorry for him.  Not one tiny bit. He’s a monster.
@politvidchannel @SharonCoryell3 What a rude piece of human garbage.
@MerryGhouled @carriecoon @MrJonCryer Right!?!
@emrazz I have NO words. What a monstrous opinion to hold.

@DearAuntCrabby I’m gonna go with 40 Year Old Virgin....streaming on Netflix.
@DogginTrump You are expecting a rational human response from a sociopath.  Winning is all there is for his dead soul
@DogginTrump His dead soul cannot sense the hypocrisy.
@SocialPowerOne1 Well of course he did. https://t.co/h87APGyvyo
@ItllBeAiight @DonaldJTrumpJr Damn. You’re an optimist. Who’d have thunk it??! 😝
@ItllBeAiight @DonaldJTrumpJr Understand...his dead soul doesn’t give one tiny little fuck. Winning is all that matters to these sociopaths.
@TomiLahren Tomi, your argument here is NOT logically flawed. This is NOT a decision to be placed with the government.
@realAliTweets PRECISELY. Such a meeting is unprecedented.
@coleyworld Idk...sounds like Some jackwad who doesn’t think presidents should ever be indicted....cowinkydink??  I think not.
@JeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump As a lifelong Eastern Oregonian, I call BULLSHIT.
@edrowell Sometimes I think the same thing...I’ve got a few years to go....Do it!

@keyzpleez @ItllBeAiight @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Sir, it was you who said precisely that, in this thread, just above. And then you called me sheltered.  But whatevs.
@chargerlynn @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Hahahanaha.....Either you don’t follow Trump on Twitter (or listen to him speak) or you’re trying to make a funny joke...
@clae48 We are. Truly.
@wordsmithviv @SharonCoryell3 Nah. They’re fine. Money makes you above the law.
@ZachBarlow3 @rendale @FoxNews Wow. You have a link to that article?? Fox must have covered that story!
@jordanwfisher_ So so very wrong.
@grommitstoad @GrayMattersTwit @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump What in the word salad are you trying to say?
@keyzpleez @ItllBeAiight @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump I’m just so tired of everything being a binary argument
@keyzpleez @ItllBeAiight @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump *past*
@chargerlynn @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Oooooooh....OR - Don’t forget.....you could also call me a name or insult my intelligence.
@chargerlynn @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Yup. Only 83.  They don’t even make the top 10 list of Scary Latin Gangs...not to mention the Asian gangs. Just seems a bit anti-climactic for a full on national panic.  Immigration is not a binary argument.  But Let’s have some Fun!  No more valid arguments? Let’s blame Obama.
@keyzpleez @ItllBeAiight @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Never said they didn’t exist. Said nobody’d ever heard of them until recent tweets of our SCROTUS (so called ruler of the US).
@ZachBarlow3 @rendale @FoxNews ‘Cause I thought Obama was an African Muslim...I’m so FREAKING CONFUSED now!!!
@ZachBarlow3 @rendale @FoxNews Shitfire! Really?! Obama went to Russia when he wasn’t president? Come on Fox!! Where’s the story? You’ve been holding out on us!
@JohnFugelsang @blu_state 😂. Seriously though, that is freaking scary. I actually thought it was a joke the first time I saw it.
@rendale @FoxNews No kidding!  Hey Fox News....what do you say to that?? I sure would like to see a transcript of that meeting.
@FoxNews What does THAT mean?  I’m confused.
@keyzpleez @ItllBeAiight @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Sir, may I humbly suggest:   https://t.co/Jj71naWzu8
@FoxNews @NancyPelosi What’s the problem?  I mean, she’s only using TRUMP’S very own language here.
@AgentFinderorg @GrayMattersTwit @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump FACT: I am far more terrified by the “president” meeting COMPLETELY UNSUPERVISED with Vladamir Putin than I am of some gang which accounts for an average of 83 arrests a year.
@jeremiah_r_cook @imwithher61 @realDonaldTrump Nah. I mostly follow school shootings, but I guess that is a whole ‘nother issue.
@chargerlynn @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Yes. Although an average of 83 arrests a year since 2012 hardly seems like a call for national hysteria....
@jeremiah_r_cook @imwithher61 @realDonaldTrump Who got beaten and gunned down? I missed that story!
@realDonaldTrump You know...I’d get freaking FIRED from my job If I spent half as much time on Twitter as you do.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Wait...just to be clear....so while the mexican drug dealers and rapists are getting all our fancy jobs, we are being taken over by some gang that NOBODY ever heard of before Trump?? Have I got that right?
RT @TheAtlantic: A century ago, the 1918 flu pandemic killed five percent of humanity. This week, @mthomps asks science writers @EdYong209…
@UN @Refugees @antonioguterres @facebook He should be saying, “War is unacceptable in the 21st Century; Then we wouldn’t have to talk about rape as a weapon of war. “
@AllenCMarshall Yup.
@tedlieu @RepGoodlatte Yeah. That Tom Delay thing pissed me off.
@Stonekettle @BravenakBlog Complacency.  Gen X-ers.  We are the complacent generation.
@MichaelAvenatti @azcentral In other words, stop tweeting and fucking get to work.
@KING5Seattle Sadness. They probably pay $6,000 a month to live there too.
@mrsbrg60 @shna23 @lyndajorn2 @missmayn @MonteAJP23 Who said a man lost his wife? I thought a woman lost her friend.
@mrsbrg60 @shna23 @lyndajorn2 @missmayn @MonteAJP23 Hmmm....seemed like a full on “pro-choice” tweet in the beginning....just sayin’.
@mrsbrg60 @lyndajorn2 @missmayn @MonteAJP23 Not all women have super strong child rearing bodies. The risk is very great to some.
@HoarseWisperer Wait. What is this actually? A transcript?
@DogginTrump check out Oregon’s system. Stress free/computer free mail-in paper ballots and identity verified DMV voter registration. A win/win.
@JebBush Come on, Mr. Bush....it is a little MORE than disappointing, don’t you think?
@Stonekettle @GrayMattersTwit A commonsense solution!  Love it.
@JacksonianTexan @TortieMom @MBH222 @Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump Y’all = The World - Fox News.

@bigleaguepol A national embarrassment Hated by the whole world....gee how sad. I wonder why..... https://t.co/Om9Y5DzUU8
@NBCNews @SharonCoryell3 “APPEARS to mock”?? No. That was full on mocking.
@JordanUhl @MrJonCryer Disgusting.
@ananavarro  https://t.co/9audVyqjS7
@DemsOfState @chuckwestover We’ve had mail-in ballots in Oregon for 20 years or so now. Voter registration through the DMV. No stress voting.  So easy.  And unlike a computer program, less susceptible to hacks.
@ananavarro @GMSarli Oh I so so so hope he sees it.
@RealDonaldTrFan Damn, dude. You get me every time with these.
@fortyforfour @coleyworld Just DO IT!
@fortyforfour @HollywoodNobody Vote. If it didn’t matter they wouldn’t make it so hard to vote!
@Stonekettle Yeah.   What’s the score?
@Bennythesnitch @FoxNews He needs his new marching orders.
@lgt117 @thehill With all he has to do....LOL....perhaps he should STOP TWEETING then!!
@MillenPolitics Alone and off the record....that has NEVER happened before.
@cromas @CaptainComput3r @Alyssa_Milano Yes. From ACTUAL Court transcriptions.
@CaptainComput3r @Alyssa_Milano A re-enactment based off of Court transcripts. I read a child in Portland actually crawled up on the table.
@Alyssa_Milano Insanity.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP So the dudes who GOT elected are chatting it up with the dudes who helped them get elected.  Go figure...
@Georgecolevet @DeeplorableRick @ChelseaClinton #forcedabortion
@JoanneAa @DeeplorableRick @ChelseaClinton Repugnant is closer to the truth
@BernadineJoel @realelysetaylor @DeeplorableRick @ChelseaClinton It also means that they aren’t denied access to birth control either.  Which kind of helps out with the whole abortion thing.
@DeeplorableRick @ChelseaClinton What an uncouth thing to say. Mind your manners!

@Manuel82682848 @ItllBeAiight @thehill Perhaps you should climb down from your high horse and refrain from lecturing me on what I should and should not do with my emotions.

@Manuel82682848 @ItllBeAiight @thehill Yes, yes. We know. Be civil. 🙄Only “Your President” gets to speak like that with his patented blend of “Cruelty and Dickishness”
@benshapiro Wow.  I thought you were smarter than that false equivalency.  Guess not.
@giftedgirl727 @BlueJayResist @dthomicide @realDonaldTrump 🤢🤮
@jcut15 @mariashriver @WhiteHouse @Twitter @SenWarren @SenKamalaHarris I see.  You haven’t got an intelligent or well reasoned response so you resort to shaming and name-calling. Typical.  Not to mention I don’t give a flying fuck whether or not you find me or my opinions “becoming”.
@jcut15 @mariashriver @WhiteHouse @Twitter @SenWarren @SenKamalaHarris It is a tactic of a dictator to use official government resources to publicly attack political opponents.
@mariashriver @WhiteHouse @Twitter @SenWarren @SenKamalaHarris How DARE anyone disagree with him. He says that “the other side better take it easy....They better take it easy”.
@MyDogNose @funder @Readiculous Love my man Jon Stewart. :)

@Windows Thanks.
@UKUS411 I love this so much.
@funder 💜600 BRAVE women! 💜
@LeanneWheat @CBSNews Awwww....and now you call me names. Typical. Does it make you feel superior?
@LeanneWheat @CBSNews Rudeness does scratch nerves. That was your intention with your original rude tweet was it not? Calling out my “common sense” for questioning why the First Lady of the U.S. would wear such a classless, tacky and insulting jacket when she has an army of stylists at her fingertips. https://t.co/2GpyveIuZU
@LeanneWheat @CBSNews She doesn’t care about you either.

@JamesSm14244357 @DavidsonKL @FoxNews @FoxFriendsFirst @TomFitton @JudicialWatch @MaxineWaters I think you meant to say this about your violence inciting president. The most uncivil of them all.
@philing99 @PattyArquette @BabyGirlMcKenna Why don’t you go find out.
@AndBussey @delila_cain @emrazz Yes. What a fantastic solution that is. Wow. What a backwards little mind you have.
@JustLuthien @KamalaHarris NOT like this. Clinton got a blowjob.

@dougie1894 @notheretoplease @sweatergoddtx @TalbertSwan @ThatBOL_Fox You babble.
@dougie1894 @sweatergoddtx @TalbertSwan @ThatBOL_Fox Oh....But Trump cares?? 😆🤣 The delusion of folks like you astounds me.
@dougie1894 @notheretoplease @sweatergoddtx @TalbertSwan @ThatBOL_Fox Simply put: Your leader is an embarrassment to this nation.
@sweatergoddtx @notheretoplease @dougie1894 @TalbertSwan @ThatBOL_Fox They have no logic. They cannot face their own hypocrisy.
@Ocasio2018 Well done. Congratulations from Oregon!!
@KamalaHarris Not to mention the president is under investigation.
@SenFeinstein Not to mention the Muller investigation is not finished. Letting a potential criminal appoint a supreme court justice seems wrong to me.
@adamcbest @eugenegu ABSOLUTELY!! That is so so very true!
@Windows I’ve never had more trouble with viruses that are unfindable and unfixable.  The “bloatware” is super annoying and useless. I should have just paid extra to get Windows 7. *sigh* now i am stuck
@Windows I hate the rearranging of everything after 20 years of it being relatively similar throughout different systems. I am somehow logged into Facebook and other useless stuff in the background so there are hundreds of notifications each week.
@Windows Wow. Thanks for caring. I think Windows 7 is the best ever. Windows 10 is so “noisy” with all the apps, Cortana is USELESS (have a phone for all that). It updates CONSTANTLY and takes so so long to do that it hurts the functionality of the machine and my ability to get to work
@JohnnyBlkshrt Grapes of Wrath changed me. Also Fahrenheit 451.
@drmrs121 @bigleaguepol Do you even read Trump’s tweets?? He’s the rudest of them all.
@carold501 @nxtmrssmoltz @bigleaguepol True. Lefties are held to a MUCH higher standard.

@JadedCreative @kim @MichaelAvenatti @jimmyfallon Dude, whyyyyy??? 🤢 I did NOT need that mental image.
@Thrilho505 @Firehorsegirly @realDonaldTrump @jack @TwitterSupport So....it’s okay for Trump to do, but no one else? #wow
@JustinJBernard @LOLGOP @foonhammer They’re trying to remove the protection for pre-existing conditions.  NOT the same thing.
@djonzey64 @realDonaldTrump @jimmyfallon That is such an offensive thing to say about 12 year old girls!
@kumailn No. They don’t.
@angrymcflooby @pragmaticNYC @johnbates207 @deusregem @RoamingMil @DonCheadle @realDonaldTrump Noted.  And Well then, we agree on that point.
@angrymcflooby @pragmaticNYC @johnbates207 @deusregem @RoamingMil @DonCheadle @realDonaldTrump While I have no doubt that immigration housing was federally ordered in prior administrations, it was your ol’ “Sheriff Joe” who presided over and WAS DAMN PROUD of the horrid squalid conditions of those “death” camps.
@angrymcflooby @DonCheadle Oh, How very inconvenient for you and your argument. Sad. My little tiny local newspaper in a town of 10,000 has online archives.  Maybe you should write a letter to the editor about that!
@angrymcflooby @pragmaticNYC @johnbates207 @deusregem @RoamingMil @DonCheadle @realDonaldTrump Hmmmm....seems like I remember good ol’ “Sheriff Joe” getting into pretty hot water for some of HIS “death” camps.
@angrymcflooby @DonCheadle Oh!! There’s this cool new thing called Google!! It’s neat-o. You should check it out!!
@angrymcflooby @pragmaticNYC @johnbates207 @deusregem @RoamingMil @DonCheadle @realDonaldTrump OMG. Your Fox and your Breitbart and your InfoWars would have CRUCIFIED Obama if he had been running Tent Camps in the desert at $780 per head per day.
@RebelPatriot4 @ValkyrieToGlory @thehill Yeah. I know. For 8 years....Like two decades ago. Maybe I am just a “dumb libtard” but.....What’s your point here?
@PDXJulia @CardsFanTX @DonCheadle It is such a complex issue.  I Agree it is not fixed.  ABC is now reporting that ICE is asking for $15,000 new beds. I read $780 a day at newly constructed camp. Do the math on that...I think it is about $350 Million a month.
@CBSNews And we can afford this how, exactly? I see figures that say $780 per person per night in these camps. That’s $11 million a day, $351 million a month. Over $4 billion for a year.
@RebelPatriot4 @ValkyrieToGlory @thehill Hillary is not the president.
@ValkyrieToGlory @thehill 😂
@Gsquare9 @JohnMFMclane @DonCheadle I like it when they block me.
@CardsFanTX @DonCheadle I have no doubt that families were separated under prior administrations. I would think it would have had to happen. The issue here is the sheer magnitude of the numbers since the April implementation of zero tolerance.
@AmericanAsIs @TalbertSwan @Bkcharlie @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy *you’re*
@TalbertSwan @GMSarli @RCamposDuffy Aww...they’re just trying to help their older, mildly racist viewers sleep at night.
@HALLMARKMYDBOOK @FoxNews Or she is just as tone deaf and out of touch and horrible as he is.
@JacksJeanine @FoxNews Ah, name calling. What a great argument that is for you all.  And how very like the right to point media attention to a fashion choice while your party quietly works to GUT medicare, so the rich can get richer.
@UPYOURS555 @JuliaLeedy @KathyDa81258360 @FoxNews Wow.  REALLY? If Fox told you to think it was ok, you’d be good with her going to a state funeral in a jacket that says I DON’T CARE in all caps?? Now tell us true: What if Hillary had shown up in public in that jacket? What would Fox say? What argument would you be making then?
@jenjaemickmars @Spelmanite88 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @flouts The bigger picture.  I could not care less about her attire or tho attire of any other woman in politics.  BUT That jacket. How many $39 jackets do you suppose MRS TRUMP owns? I don’t care WHAT the “message” was “supposed” to be that jacket was disgraceful and tone deaf.

@robinlecronesco @GrayMattersTwit Obama deported record numbers of undocumented. Keywords here: “Family Detention”.  No baby jails...oh sorry.... I meant “tender age facilities”.  Try to keep up.
@robinlecronesco 😪
@GrayMattersTwit @robinlecronesco I have to stop.  This is just too easy. Plus she cites INFOWARS as her news source for this. I mean Alex Jones....now there’s another shining intellect for ya.

@robinlecronesco @GrayMattersTwit Me too!  After reading this thread I am concerned that I might come down with it.  Tell me please....what are the symptoms??
@robinlecronesco @GrayMattersTwit PLEASE I do not deny cases of minors being held in detention centers over the last 20 years. HOWEVER, if, due to his own NEW policy our BLACK president had been keeping THOUSANDS of kids in hastily built tent camps your Fox and Breitbart folks would have absolutely crucified him.
@cturtle31 @GrayMattersTwit @my2twh @berriojo1 @danpfeiffer I sure hope not!
@GrayMattersTwit @miguel_joiada @HollywoodNobody @Jeff424V @my2twh @berriojo1 @danpfeiffer It is all so convoluted; I surely wouldn’t presume to know how it is all going to play out.
@emmmmmm_____ @notreallyachola @Terrapintaco93 @hippiehomemakr Then don’t sugar coat it. Tell it how it was. Our ancestors stole this land. Murdered for it.
@miguel_joiada @GrayMattersTwit @HollywoodNobody @Jeff424V @my2twh @berriojo1 @danpfeiffer I think perhaps he is referring to the Flores Settlement?
@IMJuanted The article said it was due to the new temporary facilities and services. It cites a 2014 estimate that full family housing in more permanent structures was more like $298 a day.  https://t.co/1BpimPsML3

@misterbumface @jzanier468 @TheRealDRaff WOWW
@sararesistencia @GrayMattersTwit @my2twh @berriojo1 @danpfeiffer @realDonaldTrump @GOP Yep. But there is “no money” for higher education or healthcare....amongst other things.
@TheRightDefense @AnnieOakley2015 @GrayMattersTwit @Jeff424V @HollywoodNobody @my2twh @berriojo1 @danpfeiffer My cursory understanding is the Flores Settlement only applies to unaccompanied minors. Additionally, according to the DOJ it was never really enacted by INS. Wasn’t until 2003 when it became ICE that real changes were implemented. I imagine it will however become an obstacle.
@cirras_bane @RVAwonk @AlaskaLadyDee @IvankaTrump @POTUS Let me have this shred of hope...but yes. Agreed...
@thehill Fine by me. Keep that propaganda squarely where it belongs.
@BryanDawsonUSA The apple does not rot far from the tree.

@grasshoppr93 @GrayMattersTwit Is is real.  And sometimes...but not very often.....it is even instant.
