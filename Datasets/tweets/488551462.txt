@AviKaner She has no idea how many jobs in addition to the Amazon jobs that her constituents lost.
@tolmanbrett The area would need more cops, firefighters, sanitation workers. They’ll be more newsstands, shoe shine booths, etc. Nevermind the never ending construction that comes with all of these projects.
@tolmanbrett And new hotels would mean jobs for housekeepers, front desk personnel, security, and hotel restaurants.
@tolmanbrett She is clueless. If she wants mom and pop jobs, this project was a great way. With 25,000 new workers, the area would need bars, restaurants, coffee shops, and food trucks.
