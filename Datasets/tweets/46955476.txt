@Philip_T_Gray Oh, no worries, I didn't!
@kristoncapps Amen
@kristoncapps #slatepitch
Forgive me, Father, for I have tweetstormed about my feature, committing the most cliche sin of political journalism
@Philip_T_Gray Oh yes! Every time I told someone I was working on this story, this was the first thing they'd bring up.
Well, some. Lucianne Goldberg told me, "We chopped him alive. He never was the same. I don’t care whether he got impeached or not." I'm not sure that would have seemed true in 1999 or 2000 or 2005 or 2010 or 2015. But today, it's far more convincing. 	-30- (until I remember more)
Despite the serious acrimony at the time, I was struck by how many of the ex-Clinton partisans and ex-Clinton antagonists are now on friendly, even sort of buddy-buddy terms. Time heals all wounds!
It was striking how many of them still firmly believe they did the right thing, even knowing what happened—including James Rogan, who was an impeachment manager, then lost his next reelection campaign some guy named @RepAdamSchiff.
Another thing is just how early many Republicans grasped that impeachment was going to be a political loser. Maybe they didn't get how big—but they knew that the idea of impeaching was unpopular. They had polling.
This is not an especially novel insight, but it's just impossible to imagine this playing out today the way it did. Given that Democrats forced Al Franken out for much less than what Bill Clinton did, it's hard to imagine him surviving today (tho partisanship is a powerful drug)
The Starr report is a wild, wild document! even in the age of Trump, it's bizarre to know that much about the intimate details of the life of the president of the United States.
I was alive and probably more conscious than most people my age during the Clinton impeachment... but I was also still in middle school. Getting up to speed on it was fascinating.

@TheBigFoxx We can drop it, but you'll note we haven't even gotten to the question of who they've influenced so far... which I feel would be a Kanye rout.
@TheBigFoxx Love to say "agree to disagree" when you're losing the argument
@TheBigFoxx You keep coming back to sales. I think sales are a bad, or at least woefully incomplete, metric. If we were just going to rely on numbers, there'd be nothing to discuss.
@TheBigFoxx Lol only as influential as sly stone? I consider the point conceded. Gaga was to “standards records with Tony Bennett” by her fourth album. At 4, Kanye was still warming up
@TheBigFoxx MBDTF will go down as far more influential than any Gaga record to date.

@yeselson @AlexParkerDC @TheAtlantic No apology necessary! I'm just saying, only one of us in that thread was getting snippy.
@yeselson @AlexParkerDC @TheAtlantic Don't both-sides me, Rich.
@AlexParkerDC I conceded I misunderstood what you wrote. I didn't put words in your mouth; and in any case, did you like when I did that? You're just being snippy and wasting both of our time.
@zengerle @jmartNYT @TheWillHobson @DukeChronicle Painfully true
@AlexParkerDC @yeselson @TheAtlantic Perhaps instead of telling me what I think, you should spend some time on Spotify rectifying your oversight.
@AlexParkerDC @yeselson @TheAtlantic That's not what I'm saying at all, but thanks for speaking for me! I'll say this once more, and if you don't get it then, I can't help you: I believe that people don't know these songs, but I find it weird and disheartening.
@jmartNYT @TheWillHobson It was a major cultural event on campus when 808s came out. We ran a two-page spread in @DukeChronicle
@AlexParkerDC @yeselson @TheAtlantic My point is that Even The Fusty Atlantic is hip to Kanye. Comparing Mozart to a literal pop musician is risky territory but uh I bet a lot of people know "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"
@AlexParkerDC @yeselson I am obviously here to stan for @TheAtlantic but we are not always exactly at the cutting edge of culture and we called him an "American Mozart," on the cover, in 2012 https://t.co/U7zQIm9wW0
@KralcTrebor @mollyesque Surely not!
@AlexParkerDC @yeselson No, you can listen to what you want. I think it's strange to be so blithely unaware of one of the most important artists of the moment. YMMV.
@AlexParkerDC @yeselson If you want to get snarky, fine: Yes, I'm sorry you did too.
@yeselson @AlexParkerDC Certainly, that is true. And Kanye was, I thought, one of the few figures who was able to transcend it.
@AlexParkerDC You don't have to like it.
@AlexParkerDC I tend to think broad cultural knowledge and curiosity about the most important artists of the era are good assets for reporters and for members of society
@AlexParkerDC Ok
@AlexParkerDC And is that a good thing?
@gavinohara Sure
@AlexParkerDC No, I accept your argument, *and* I think it's weird.
@AlexParkerDC Ok, fine. But I'm saying I think it's weird not to have even a glancing familiarity. I mean, the top 40 is mostly composed of songs that are, or are partly, rap.
@AlexParkerDC It's literally what you said. Feel free to scroll up and re-read it.
@AlexParkerDC I think this sort of writing off as "Oh, it's rap" is an excuse that underestimates the music's reach. I am not nearly as rap literate as I ought to be, but...
@AlexParkerDC They should.
@AlexParkerDC Nah. My point is that a certain amount of basic cultural knowledge is something I assume... and no one would ask such a Q about Roth, because it would seem callow

When I profiled Eskamani earlier this year, I noted that millennials tend to swear, and that tends to lend itself into attack ads. Here's an interesting approach to dealing with that: https://t.co/gXoWNipx35 https://t.co/ouTXbzhpQf
@pcgstl Sure. What's notable is that Kavanaugh *denied* any difficulty, whereas Trump is seeing it in what he said.
@mahavishnu_can @TheAtlantic NAFTA was negotiated by George H.W. Bush and signed by Clinton, though.
Trump, noting he's a teetotaler, says Kavanaugh "said he had difficulty as a young man with drink." That seems to overstate what the judge said.
Trump: "I watched him. I was surprised at how vocal he was about the fact that he likes beer."
Trump says FBI should interview Kavanaugh
Ah, there we go, "Dr. Ford"
Seems noteworthy that Trump won't name Christine Blasey Ford. Calls her "the doctor"
Is Trump accusing Democratic senators of sexual misconduct?		"I watched those senators on the Democrat side and I thought it was a disgrace, and partially because I know them. I know them too well. They are not angels."
Trump ratifies the partisan nature of the FBI Kavanaugh probe: "I want them to do a very comprehensive investigation. Whatever that means according to the senators and the Republicans and the Republican majority."

@YanceyMc Maybe, but I don't know how you'd make that binding enough to comfort anyone
So that even if Kavanaugh felt he were innocent but didn't want to put himself/his family through more of an ordeal, he might hesitate to pull out.
This is a really interesting piece, and I think points to one reason Kavanaugh would resist withdrawing: Withdrawal might seem like admission, and admission would make it hard to stay on the DC Circuit https://t.co/YVSV4Gwbaf

@ahrensf Read the rest of the thread—I would not be surprised if his grandfather and Erskine Hawkins share something.
This concludes my best stab at imitating @YAppelbaum on Twitter
It's interesting to me that at that time, Ramsay, who was based in Alabama, was offering that money to African American parents, like Hawkins's, as well as white ones. Anyway, it's an interesting antecedent to this KFC stunt. /fin
As it turns out, from the Alabama mining magnate Erskine Ramsay. His name is Scottish in origin, as was he. In the early 20th C., it seems, he was offering savings accounts to parents who'd name their children Erskine. /3
Hawkins is most famous for writing the standard "Tuxedo Junction." But what an unusual name—Erskine! Where would that come from? /2
This is not entirely new—thought it might be a stretch to call it venerable. This story reminds me of the great bandleader Erksine Hawkins. /1 https://t.co/WuYWHo8AsU

I find it very hard to say that Trump was saying "no" to whether Russia interfering now, but @HallieJackson is right to ask why, given repeated White House reversals, anyone should afford them the benefit of the doubt.
Peter Doocy tried to serve up a softball to Sanders on forcing Trump's interpreter to testify, and instead she slapped it away and said it was a State Department Q. Hilarious.
Sanders again with Trump's favorite straw man. No one is saying better relations with Russia are a bad thing per se.
How can Sanders say the White House takes seriously election interference when he repeatedly calls the Mueller investigation into interference a witch hunt, including blasting it while standing alongside Putin?

@EdAsante77 I just think Sully's argument here is unpersuasive as political strategy
@EdAsante77 I am also not convinced that building the wall and then saying, "That's it, we're done" would be a particularly political successful strategy for Democrats. I think Repubs wouldn't buy it and many liberals would be upset. Do you disagree?
@EdAsante77 https://t.co/YzB1eioYGx	Is it your view that the wall is why Trump won?
Sullivan's point about mandates is fine as far as it goes, but if the idea is that giving Trump the wall is going to be politically advantageous to Dems, I don't see it.
