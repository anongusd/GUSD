Many have been saying "stay safe" to people in Hawai‘i because of the hurricane not realizing in Hawaiian Pidgin English "stay safe" is a question.
I'm prepared are you? https://t.co/sZO7Attzkr
Caution: This post may create a brain tattoo. Damn, every time I read about the wind speed of hurricane Lane I hear the Eagle's "Life In The Fast Lane" in my head.
There is no truth to the report of the Puna community on the Big Island of Hawai‘i air dropping bails of marijuana on hurricane Lane in an effort to slow it down.
With so many schools and businesses closing because of hurricane Lane why haven't we heard "Lane closures" more?
First world Hawai‘i hurricane problems:		How will I charge my electric toothbrush?		Will Starbucks drive thru also close at 4pm?		Why is it every time I have my car detailed there’s a hurricane?		Lava, Hurricane, AND I’m having a bad hair day.

@JadeMoon1 Thanks Jade.
Worried about North Korea? Just imagine Kim Jong-un on Letterman and Dave saying "I think you misunderstand what 'slaying the babes' means."
I don't think Kim Jong-un would be trying so hard to make a name for himself if that gangnam style video hadn't been so popular.
I believe North Korea has nuclear capabilities because if they didn't, by now, someone would have told them their military uniforms suck.
Poor North Korea.  This is what happens when your country is run by the guy who was always picked last for basketball.
