Midlothian Police were called on 12/22 towed my vehicle for medical reasons. Discriminating against #autistic #handicapped mother of a son who was taken from her by the Department of Children and Family Services. The @FBI mentioned they had my car in custody. Who's MO? @zachbraff
@Travon @pattonoswalt At least we're funding a wall around our country like other country do. North Korea does it. Why can't we? You got some four walls in your bedroom to separate the bathroom from your rec room. No?! Okay, let's do an #openconcept then.	@realDonaldTrump what are your thoughts?
@realDonaldTrump The midwest has lakes so we have our own built-in global warming system. Tell them to read some books about stuff and weather. &lt;3

@zachbraff @edsheeran When do we get to make out. You've had two piano lessons already. You're not gonna play Norah Jones at our wedding. We can call Rachel and ask her the #reasonwhy She'll prob know

@zachbraff I promise I'll do anything you ask #thistime
How's @Disney doing today? Have you sent out quarterly residuals for last quarter because #medicaid just canceled my insurance and now I'm six weeks pregnant #Howdoesthathappen #questionmark #dictation Wait, am I typing too fast #Twitter Friends. Thank God for Twitter.
@carybrothers @NorthwesternU Good, now I don't have to go to my Neuroscience of the Auditory system class. Oh wait, that's online so nevermind. Thanks Evanston Shuttle Service and all the #bluelights on our campus keeping everything secure. You're doing a fine job #NSA

@zachbraff Dude, NU is closed this week. What did you do blow at the festival or is that just hail. Wait, I'm guessing it's an avalanche down a double black diamond. #ZachBraff
@realDonaldTrump This reminds me of the entertainment industry. They write scripts with make-believe people and fictitious accounts of random circumstances no one cares about. &lt;3 How are the book sales going?
