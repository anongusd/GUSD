@JoeNBC You critique Palin for speaking out and critique other R's for not speaking out. You should join forces and get something done.
@pochelp we all get to have our own opinion enough said on all this enjoy your day.
@pochelp as for Palin why are the boys and libs so fearful of her? Doubt she will run for Pres anyway. Do not get why she upsets people.
@pochelp does he have to say last place would earn more than winning LET? Why insult the LET or Kaymer's (cont) http://tl.gd/783hp1
@JasonSobel It was an obvious attempt at a joke rather than say something decent. I saw your followup. How dumb do you think people are?
@JasonSobel I cannot DM you but it was in reply to your comment about Kaymer needing cash.
@JasonSobel don't say something nice when you can say something stupid.
@suzannpettersen who is @TPCreamer?
@KellyTilghman we should not have golf in the Olympics. There is enough global competition.
@DraftJoe2012 this is from Sept. You really are trying to hurt Palin. What are the boys afraid of?
@DraftJoe2012 this laughable. You cannot even get 300 followers to this twitter feed. I like Joe but too much time at MSNBC is showing now.
@WestwoodLee twitter for iPhone is best. In upper right corner click pencil then the 140 and it will give you choices like camera.
@Aflanny lockout will make no difference I think Floyd and Rudolph will be back at ND. Rudy for sure to play with Crist and go to BCS.

@TheChristinaKim NBC
@cbrennansports why are USA players in Euro powder blue? Mrs Pavin had no clue with this. Red white and blue are the colors to build around
@ronsirak too bad USA is in Euro blue. What was Mrs Pavin thinking? Worst USA uni's ever. PGA should be ashamed for letting this happen.
@MattGolf365 at least Overton and Bubba have on red and white rather than Euro powder blue. Euros don't even wear that. Mrs Pavin no clue
@rydercup why is USA in Euro powder blue? Mrs Pavin has NO clue with the uniforms. Bubba and Overton look good with white hats red sweaters
@JasonSobel Mrs Pavin has no clue why are we in Euro powder blue. Glad Bubba and Overton are in Red w/white hats. Uniforms a disaster.
@PaulAzinger why are we wearing powder blue that is a Euro color. Glad to see Bubba and Overton with white hats on. We need you back as Capt
