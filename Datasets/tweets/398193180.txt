@AdamA_inLA There is no new progressive Caucus. There is only one. And anyone who is a progressive is part of it. Even the new members.
5. And no matter what happens, I will fight for Medicare-for-All, Equity in environmental policy, a üíØ percent clean energy future, protecting a Women‚Äôs Right to Choose, A complete &amp; accurate census, Comprehensive Immigration Reform and much more.
A few facts to keep in mind regarding my decision: 1. No one is running against Pelosi. (Not even Barbara Lee) 2. Most MoC trying to block Pelosi are considered centrists. 3. So far two of the anti-Pelosi MoC have flipped &amp; will vote for her. 4. I predict more will follow.

Senator McCain led by example by teaching us that representing your constituents means working across the aisle and that is only done by having respect for each other even when we don‚Äôt agree with one another.
Being a newbie to Congress I never really got to know Senator McCain as a colleague, but the time during the 2008 Presidential campaign where he defended then Senator Obama is a moment I will never forget. A moment that all elected officials should watch and aspire to be like.
Carry on my sweet survivor, carry on my lonely friend	Don't give up on the dream, and don't you let it end.	Carry on my sweet survivor,	Though you know that something's gone	For everything that matters carry on. #RIP
Thank you Senator McCain.
