The Senate voted 83-16, the House 300-128, to authorize $1.375 billion in public money to be spent for more physical barrier on the southern border. Nothing in the National Emergencies Act gives Trump any power to spend a dollar more than the $1.375 billion Congress appropriated

Why do so many people think that Trump directing his LAWYER to lie to CONGRESS about Trump‚Äôs Moscow project would end his presidency while lying to all 320 million Americans about the same thing is no big deal? Only because of the myth that criminal law holds the key! It doesn‚Äôt.

Those who say it‚Äôs unconstitutional to do X only if a court would forbid X have forgotten the political question doctrine. Eg, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs unconstitutional to impeach a president without a high crime or misdemeanor, even though no court wd intervene if one impeached for bad hair

Sort of. But the political pressure wd be incomparably greater to try an impeached POTUS &amp; either convict or clear him. And it‚Äôs arguable that the Senate can ‚Äúadvise‚Äù by withholding its ‚Äúconsent‚Äù w/out holding any hearing. It can‚Äôt ‚Äútry‚Äù someone without holding any trial at all. https://t.co/Ms9nEUWCMI
This is among the constitutional duties enforced only by political pressure, not judicial decree. Just like the Senate‚Äôs duty to remove a president upon convicting him of a high crime although no court would overrule a lawless Senate verdict of ‚Äú67 vote guilty ‚Äî but never mind.‚Äù https://t.co/iQpeC8q9uz
The structure, history, function, and logic of the Constitution‚Äôs Impeachment Power makes clear that it would be unconstitutional for the Senate simply to abdicate its ‚Äúsole Power to try ALL Impeachments‚Äù ‚Äî which isn‚Äôt a power to try ‚Äúsuch impeachments as it chooses to try.‚Äù
That McConnell wrongly refused to give Merrick Garland any consideration for SCOTUS is being used by some to argue that the Senate would have no constitutional duty to try Trump even if the House impeaches him. That‚Äôs bootstrapping on steroids. One wrong doesn‚Äôt justify two.
This seems to be why Mueller decided to get people to chill about the Buzzfeed bombshell. Note that Mueller‚Äôs rare statement did NOT deny that Cohen lied to Congress about the Moscow project at the direction of Individual 1. Congress must begin investigating this NOW. https://t.co/xi7IxXDyAH
1. All but unthinkable with an impeached president, who would surely demand a Senate trial rather than attempt to govern as an impeached but not cleared POTUS.	2. That something has been done before without judicial intervention doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs consistent with the Constitution. https://t.co/zzz8atsxRU
See the Senate rules: https://t.co/VIiDeEZNoL
Advice &amp; Consent covers a continuum from no meetings to pro forma meetings to a full confirmation hearing and floor vote. Holding a trial or not doing so is a binary choice.

To be clear, Bob Bauer didn‚Äôt overlook an explicit, judicially enforceable command in Art. I.

HAS NOBODY NOTICED? By keeping government shut down and not paying military, TSA &amp; other ‚Äúessential‚Äù fed workers, Trump violates spirit of the 13th Amendment, banning forced labor, and of Sec 4 of the 14th, demanding that the US pay all its legally authorized debts. Just sayin.
Barr on 1/15: ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not going to indict someone, you don‚Äôt . . . unload negative information about the person. That‚Äôs not the way the department does business.‚Äù Problem: Barr thinks you CAN‚ÄôT indict a sitting president. So he‚Äôs saying (in code) he‚Äôll bury the Mueller report!

Barr seems to believe that the special counsel regs mean that a  Mueller decision not to indict Trump (by virtue of the 2000 OLC memo) would justify Barr‚Äôs bottling up any report about Trump‚Äôs criminal or impeachable offenses! That‚Äôs legally dubious and constitutionally horrible

Now that we understand how presidential obstruction can be part and parcel of collusion with Russia, someone must ask Barr how he can say he hasn‚Äôt opined on Mueller‚Äôs collusion inquiry while writing in his 6/8/18 memo that ‚ÄúMueller‚Äôs obstruction theory is fatally misconceived‚Äù?

Some people talk as though there‚Äôs a spectrum from being (1) indictable while POTUS, to being (2) impeachable &amp; removable. But there‚Äôs actually a broad range that‚Äôs BOTH, where considerations of prudence control how DOJ &amp; Congress should proceed and what should come first.
That was my recollection. @marty_lederman @PhilipBobbitt @walterdellinger @benjaminwittes. My own view is that a sitting POTUS can *definitely* be indicted and, unless the statute of limitations clock is stopped and pardon possibilities are shut down, can be prosecuted as well. https://t.co/4Dqh6hhFlZ

All Trump wants is to look stubborn in the eyes of his base. Since declaring a ‚Äúnational emergency‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt build a single mile of wall anyway, maybe he should just SAY he‚Äôs declared an emergency and count on his base believing him, as it always does.

The fact that 10 U.S. Code ¬ß 2663 authorizes seizure of land for a list of purposes (eg ‚Äúmilitary training camps‚Äù &amp; ‚Äúcoast defenses‚Äù) that doesn‚Äôt include building walls to keep immigrants out would be treated under the Steel Seizure decision as akin to a congressional ban.

FWIW, @chrislhayes, not even a declaration of ‚Äúnational emergency‚Äù would enable Trump to seize the private property needed for his wall without specific authorization from Congress.

Maybe Judge Emett Sullivan casually used the word ‚Äútreason‚Äù because the redacted material suggested that Flynn was working with Trump to help Turkey and Russia carve up Syria, which would give ‚Äúaid and comfort‚Äù to ISIS, our ENEMY. Note Trump‚Äôs sudden withdrawal from Syria today.

@marty_lederman Marty, you did indeed say ‚Äúwe'd do well to keep our eyes focused on the real danger--not possible minor offenses Trump committed in 2016.‚Äù How can that not encompass his direction of that whole conspiracy?
@marty_lederman Of course you‚Äôre right that Trump‚Äôs kompromat is hugely more dangerous than his hush money stuff, but I think you‚Äôre way off the mark to treat those Cohen/AMI campaign finance felonies as ‚Äúminor.‚Äù

@armandodkos When the first attacks on the ACA were filed, I was overly dismissive of their prospects. By the time SCOTUS briefs were being written, I warned ACA defenders that its best hope rested on the tax power. The SG took heed and I rightly predicted the CJ‚Äôs vote and tax rationale.

@Only4RM Absolutely. I wrote an op-ed explaining that conclusion some time back.
@pleyel1848 @Lawrence No. It‚Äôs the fact that he CAN be pardoned then that establishes my argument. If he has been indicted and put on trial while still president, the odds of Art I Sec 3 Cl 7 being frustrated by a pardon from the new POTUS go way down. The preclusion of that option is unconstitutional
In the event McConnell and his GOP troops tell Trump he‚Äôll be convicted by the Senate unless he resigns soon, we need to deter a  pardon by Pence of an ex-POTUS Trump.

@JoyceWhiteVance Right. So Senators need to extract a commitment from Barr that he‚Äôd permit Mueller AND/OR SDNY to indict POTUS while still sitting
Saying that a criminal president can be impeached &amp; removed and indicted LATER is NO ANSWER:		1. That option depends on his base in Congress turning on him. 		2. It also lets his VP PARDON him right after becoming POTUS.		So depending ONLY on impeachment puts him ABOVE THE LAW.
I just don‚Äôt get it. If Trump shot someone, he‚Äôd be indicted in a New York minute. Nothing in the Constitution prevents his indictment for directing a criminal conspiracy to steal the presidency. Certainly not a DOJ ‚Äúpolicy.‚Äù
That‚Äôd be my bet as well ‚Äî unless Trump resigns or is removed sooner.		https://t.co/qK8gppkhZo via rawstory

What people need to get is that it‚Äôs not ‚Äúthe money, stupid,‚Äù it‚Äôs that Trump illegally pulled the wool over your eyes to rig the election in his own favor. Are you gonna let him get away with a crime that tricked you and that would land anyone else in jail? https://t.co/tcoxkq1hqs
@KenDilanianNBC I‚Äôm sure they (and you) are right ‚Äî as a matter of construing the relevant federal criminal law statutes. But, as pretty much all con law experts agree, impeachable offenses needn‚Äôt be federal crimes as such. Only Alan Dershowitz argues the contrary.

Trump isn‚Äôt the brightest bulb on the tree, but even he must‚Äôve figured out that actually PARDONING Manafort would hurt Trump more than it could possibly help him.

Right, @marty_lederman.

HELLO!! Even defenders of an ‚Äúabsolute‚Äù &amp; ‚Äúunbounded‚Äù pardon power admit (as they must) that OFFERING a pardon IN EXCHANGE for a big favor to POTUS would be a federal crime (BRIBERY) and an impeachable offense. Manafort‚Äôs pipeline from Mueller to Trump was one HUGE favor. QED.
Great reporting, weak legal analysis: The shocking installation of Manafort as a Trump mole inside the Mueller probe wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúhighly unusual.‚Äù It was blatantly illegal. Witness tampering and obstruction of justice are serious federal crimes. 		https://t.co/6lRQt5OEfr
I know. That‚Äôs one of the reasons I‚Äôm spelling all of this out in such detail. https://t.co/slxXbwrmHx
It‚Äôs also highly suspicious that all of this is becoming visible only in the wake of Whitaker‚Äôs unlawful installation to oversee the Mueller investigation. Could it reveal that Whitaker is already facilitating the obstruction of justice that Trump put him in place to ensure?
Dangling the prospect of a presidential pardon in return for a co-conspirator‚Äôs pretending to flip so as to become the president‚Äôs secret eyes and ears in the office of the special counsel investigating the president is blatant obstruction of justice and witness tampering.
My sense has been that Mueller cut Manafort loose on learning that the similarity of his lies and Trump‚Äôs was no coincidence but a result of illicit cooperation between them and part of a scheme in which Manafort would later be pardoned. I note that @maddow had a similar thought

@NickKramarev @museabuse1 True

@padenpur Possibly
@museabuse1 If the 5th Am double jeopardy ban were construed in Gamble to preclude successive state &amp; fed prosecution for the same act,  it might follow that someone who pleaded guilty to an act that simultaneously violates federal law X &amp; state law Y wd need only a pardon under X.
Not clear this would expose Manafort to sentencing under state criminal law for acts pardoned by Trump under federal law if Gamble v. U.S. were to overrule Bartkus v. U.S. and Abbate v. U.S. Would his state guilty pleas still hold despite double jeopardy? https://t.co/aeyEUycQXl
A firm commitment to following precedent would suggest retaining the 1959 rulings (thus limiting the reach of presidential pardons), while concern for fairness to defendants and coherence in the law would suggest overturning those precedents (thus broadening the pardon power).
@Augustus709 Right!
Ironically, DOJ is arguing FOR retaining the double sovereignty doctrine, which would LIMIT the reach of presidential pardons, while Senator Hatch, as amicus, is urging the Court to OVERRULE its 1959 double sovereignty precedents, something most ‚Äúliberals‚Äù would likely favor.
Why are people just *assuming* Manafort is pardon-proof vis-a-vis state charges for the conduct he‚Äôs charged with in federal court?  Gamble v. U.S., to be argued in SCOTUS this Dec. 5, urges the Court to end that weird ‚Äúseparate sovereigns‚Äù exception to the double jeopardy ban.
Why mince words? Manafort is probably scared Putin‚Äôs goons will do to him or his family what the Saudi Crown Prince did to Khashoggi if he tells all about Putin‚Äôs collusion with Trump. https://t.co/XZIUb34Zkm

Touch√© @JoshuaMatz8! BTW, having read the Act of Congress that Trump defied with his ‚Äúonly at ports of entry‚Äù order, I have no doubt that *any* judge, regardless of ideology, would‚Äôve ruled the same way Judge Tigar did. Congress couldn‚Äôt have been clearer. https://t.co/OysJYogkl7
Read this totally devastating shredding by @steve_vladeck of Trump‚Äôs imbecilic (and threatening to the very idea of an independent judiciary) attack on the asylum ruling against his clearly lawless order and on the Ninth Circuit. https://t.co/aXA181obht
@Vynotwillplay He sure did!
In 1966, SCOTUS Justice Brennan hired Mike Tigar (Jon‚Äôs dad) to serve as his law clerk but rescinded the offer at the last minute under pressure on CJ Warren from J. Edgar Hoover just because of Tigar‚Äôs student activism at UC Berkeley. Brennan, a great Justice, later regretted it
Curious Fact re a prior Chief Justice: Judge Jon Tigar, whose ruling vs Trump‚Äôs asylum order Trump slammed as the action of an ‚ÄúObama judge,‚Äù is the son of courageous retired UC law professor and defense attorney Michael Tigar, whose career CJ Warren once unfairly hindered
I have to wonder whether Trump is trying to provoke the Chief Justice into a mudfight on the way to a showdown over a subpoena or worse. My bet is with the Chief and the rule of law, but we‚Äôve underestimated Trump before. Stay tuned. https://t.co/zVo717Xclx

The 36 state AGs who‚Äôre trying to stop this suit make the desperate and silly claim that the ACA is unconstitutional now that the purchase mandate is gone (so tax penalty = 0). Who will challenge Whitaker‚Äôs authority to side with those 36 and against Md?		https://t.co/FIQpG0dNl1

.@JillWineBanks just said that, if Mueller is prevented by DOJ policy (or by the acting AG) from indicting Trump, the hollowness of House impeachment followed by certain Senate acquittal leaves only state criminal prosecution to hold Trump accountable. Would SCOTUS intervene?
More on #Whitaker‚Äôs crackpot ideas. Not relevant to the (il)legality of his appointment but jaw-dropping anyway:		https://t.co/qBGGDFjl6J
Trump‚Äôs threat to investigate and wage war on the House investigators if they dare investigate him comes dangerously close to impeachable obstruction of justice and violates the Speech or Debate Clause (Art. I, Sec. 6, Cl. 1) by putting House members on trial for doing their jobs
I‚Äôll confess I didn‚Äôt see the magnitude of this loss for Trumpism until days after the midterms. The #BlueWave was there, after all. It just didn‚Äôt crash loudly enough on the beach of cynicism, shrouded in the fog of 2016, to register with me at first. 		https://t.co/oyQQEgbc6L

Whitaker flunks the crackpot test. He‚Äôs also constitutionally illiterate. See Art. III and Art. VI, Clause 3 (‚ÄúNo religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States‚Äù). https://t.co/i7TzmBmbyW

Nice to have bipartisan company on this, but the best companions by far are common sense; constitutional text, structure and purpose; and SCOTUS precedent. https://t.co/bAgwvpW00I
Aha. The 1898 US v. Eaton ruling must be the one @mayawiley had in mind.

@petersagal @RepCohen @Lawrence He can and should be declared a lawless pretender to the position of acting AG by the first federal court in which he seeks to subpoena or indict or prosecute anyone or in which he seeks to enforce any limit on Mueller.

I agree with @neal_katyal that lots of folks have standing to get a judicial ruling that Whitaker‚Äôs installation as acting AG is unconstitutional.

This is way too mechanistic a view. Relying on the time limit on Whitaker‚Äôs tenure as acting AG ‚Äî given the vast powers he‚Äôd be entrusted with and the irreversible damage to the nation he could do in the interim ‚Äî makes hash of the Constitution‚Äôs design.@neal_katyal @gtconway3d https://t.co/nvb2KtrmMO

*Anyone* against whom DOJ takes legal action requiring the AG‚Äôs approval has standing to challenge the legality of Whitaker‚Äôs appointment as Acting Attorney General. See NLRB v. Noel Canning (2014)(9-0).

Any US Senator would have standing under Blumenthal v. Trump to sue Trump and Whitaker in DC district court under Art II sec 2 cl 2 to challenge bypassing Senatorial advice and consent.

Mueller would have standing to ask the US district court in DC to declare that it‚Äôs still Rosenstein, not Whitaker, whose authorization is both necessary and sufficient ‚Äî assuming Mueller has decided to subpoena POTUS. https://t.co/UFs0jktL2E
This op-ed by @neal_katyal and @gtconway3d makes the same argument I made on @KatyTurNBC and @camanpour on PBS and CNNi today. Senators have standing to sue under Art II sec 2 cl 2 just as in Blumenthal v. Trump, even if others with standing opt not to:		https://t.co/KhrmW5v6bS

I‚Äôll be talking with @KatyTurNBC on MSNBC around 2:30 today about whether Trump‚Äôs installation of #Whitaker to run DOJ and undermine the #Mueller probe is legal. 		Spoiler alert: NO. It‚Äôs illegal. It violates both federal law and the U.S. Constitution, Art. II, Sec.2, Clause 2.
If Whittaker‚Äôs appointment today had been legal, he‚Äôd have to recuse. But because it‚Äôs illegal, the issue of recusal shouldn‚Äôt even arise. First things first. https://t.co/RGtokcY6Pv
Your disbelief is justified @chrislhayes. This dude‚Äôs purported appointment is clearly illegal and, if a proper party sued, a federal district court in the DC Circuit would so declare. https://t.co/jhAdoIrEGN
Makes it even clearer that he was fired. https://t.co/09Z97jwxWB
In addition, putting a mere staffer in the role of Attorney General ‚Äî not to meet a temporary emergency but to oversee a special counsel‚Äôs ongoing probe of Russia‚Äôs attack on our presidential election ‚Äî is inconsistent with the Appointments Clause of Art. II of the Constitution.
This is an unprecedented threat by an American president to obstruct an entire branch of the national government in the performance of its investigatory and oversight functions. Astonishing, @SteveSchmidtSES! https://t.co/XExaQybjXB
@BradMossEsq Or Rosenstein.
The Vacancy Reform Act bars Trump‚Äôs installation of the unconfirmed Matt Whitaker to act as attorney general to control Robert Mueller unless Sessions truly ‚Äúresigned‚Äù rather than being fired. A federal district court could be asked to see through the ruse and hold he was fired.
Yet another reason Whitaker must recuse ‚Äî that, or accept the role of co-conspirator with Trump and Trump Jr in criminal obstruction of justice. https://t.co/2gArdzNHvk
Whitaker revealed his likely MO over a year ago. He was auditioning for the job of Trump‚Äôs fixer ‚Äî the Roy Cohn he always wanted as AG. https://t.co/EehGBb4f14
Still more prejudgment by Whitaker. https://t.co/izWJf9TV7W
More evidence that Trump picked Whitaker to trim Mueller‚Äôs sails and cover up any report. If Whitaker goes along, he‚Äôs conspiring with Trump to obstruct justice. https://t.co/wkXBIbNWaO
Whitaker = whitewash. He has clearly prejudged the case and is Trump‚Äôs tool. Unless he recuses at once and puts Rosenstein back in charge of Mueller‚Äôs probe, he‚Äôs conspiring with POTUS to obstruct justice, an impeachable offense. https://t.co/SGFz7IOTAW
This! https://t.co/UgsgHKRdsc
Sessions was just forced out. His chief of staff will take over right now as acting AG. That displaces Rosenstein as Mueller's supervisor. Matt Whitaker will supervise. He'll likely be Trump's puppet. A clever Wednesday afternoon massacre by Trump.

I‚Äôm pleased to have joined this statement ‚Äî one that unites scholars across the ideological spectrum ‚Äî opposing Trump‚Äôs brazen attack on the 14th Amendment‚Äôs protection of birthright citizenship https://t.co/BtRlMPhrLu
In Snyder v. Phelps (2011), SCOTUS ruled funeral picketing is protected by the 1st Amendment. But that doesn‚Äôt make it right for Trump to defy the plea of Pittsburgh city officials that he delay his visit till the dead have been buried so funeral security is sufficient.
In the 14th Am‚Äôs text, the phrase ‚ÄúAND SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION THEREOF‚Äù qualifies the category of ‚ÄúAll persons born or naturalized in the United States,‚Äù NOT the category of those non-citizens TO WHOM such ‚Äúpersons [are] born.‚Äù So Trump‚Äôs effort to invoke that phrase flunks.
The superthin reed on which Trumpsters hang their argument that babies born in the US to ‚Äúillegals‚Äù can be declared noncitizens w/out amending the Constitution is that they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúsubject to the jurisdiction‚Äù of the US.  Even if the PARENTS cd be so described, the BABIES can‚Äôt!
Like all Borowitz columns, there‚Äôs a serious point: Even if Trump had authority to mess with the 14th Amendment to go after babies born in the USA to undocumented immigrants ‚Äî which he doesn‚Äôt ‚Äî drawing the lines his EO wd demand wd be a legal nightmare 		https://t.co/OC8ieNeDoR

Trump‚Äôs admitted use of government cellphones compromises our national security daily because ALL cell towers are vulnerable.The White House ‚Äúdefense‚Äù that he can‚Äôt leak any vital information because he knows too little to matter isn‚Äôt exactly reassuring 		https://t.co/BXvQ6PdC8X
Trump‚Äôs new threat to seal the southern border to ALL entrants ‚Äî including legal immigrants like asylum seekers ‚Äî is obviously illegal. It can only be a cynical ploy to distract attention from the real issues and toss red meat to his base. Don‚Äôt let him get away with it.
Correcting this one flagrant LIE ‚Äî a lie that nearly every Republican candidate is now shamelessly repeating ‚Äî would do more than almost anything else to flip Congress from Red to Blue.

This is a huge, blatant LIE.

.@JohnWDean‚Äôs theory doesn‚Äôt require ALL the targets to be obscure prior to Trump‚Äôs targeting‚Äî only some of them.

It‚Äôs well past the point where asking Trump to clean up his act makes sense. What he sees when he looks in the mirror bears no resemblance to reality.

Of course Trump‚Äôs abuse of power over the GSA wrt the FBI bldg to enrich himself at federal expense didn‚Äôt *literally* draw cash out of the US Treasury, but it demonstrably if indirectly cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. That makes it no less serious &amp; lots sneakier
Art. II‚Äôs ban on POTUS getting more than his congressionally set salary out of the Treasury is absolute. Unlike Art. I‚Äôs ban on foreign emoluments, the Art. II ban can‚Äôt be lifted by Congress. It‚Äôs this ban that Trump has effectively violated with the GSA and the FBI bldg in DC.
A president‚Äôs abuse of his official power to suck vast sums out of the US Treasury for his own financial benefit is more than an ordinary violation of the Domestic Emoluments Clause ‚Äî bad as that is ‚Äî but out-and-out robbery from American taxpayers.

When only one victim speaks up, the accused and his defenders argue the victim isn‚Äôt believable because nobody else has come forward. When others come forward, defenders claim politically motivated conspiracy. Heads, we lose; tails, they win. NO WAY!!!
As the cascade of accusations against the nominee mounts, expect the GOP to argue that just points to a conspiracy to get Kavanaugh. Don‚Äôt believe it. Long-suffering victims often feel liberated to speak up once others have broken their silence. History proves it.

Trump again demonstrates both his contempt for victims of sexual assault and his abject ignorance of American law and government: rape and attempted rape are STATE, not FEDERAL, crimes. The FBI had no role to play before Kavanaugh became a nominee for a federal judgeship. https://t.co/1TorxLU9lU
The deans of Harvard Law School and Yale Law School are prevented by their respective universities from publicly joining such political efforts, so no inference can be drawn from the absence of Dean  @GerkenHeather‚Äôs name from a letter about the allegations against the nominee. https://t.co/nbhjLSOOyY

When Grassley tells Dr. Christine Blasey that it‚Äôs up to the Committee majority to say who‚Äôll question her, he‚Äôs forgetting that she‚Äôs not just an ACCUSER. She‚Äôs also ACCUSED of being a mixed-up liar with partisan motives. Our tradition is that you get to confront your accusers.
It‚Äôs dumb of DJT, McConnell &amp; Grassley to resist the standard reopening of the FBI‚Äôs background investigation re Kavanaugh. It exposes their fear of getting at the truth, their desperation to get a Trump-protector on the SCt right away, and the phoniness of their ‚Äúcan‚Äôt wait‚Äù BS.

@TeriPDC @ECMcLaughlin Yes
@RandallFrench14 @MissingNothin It turns out to be more complicated than that.
Sen. Grassley wants to hire a woman lawyer not to investigate the facts (oh no, anything but that) but to question Dr. Blasey Ford so the 11-MAN GOP contingent needn‚Äôt face her directly. She has every right to object. It‚Äôs the Senators who doubt her that she wants to confront.
Turns out @EdWhelanEPPC had a specific ‚Äúdouble‚Äù in mind, but Dr. Ford said tonite that she knew and socialized with BOTH Brett AND the supposed look-alike and that there‚Äôs ‚Äúzero chance‚Äù she could‚Äôve confused the two: her assailant, she clearly recalls, was Brett Kavanaugh. https://t.co/s8p8VimcfM
Note this overlooked point: The statute of limitations issue on attempted rape is clouded by an ex post facto issue under Stogner v. Calif (2003) because pre-2002 Md law was unclear about the limitations period for sexual assault by one minor against another @Lawrence @11thHour https://t.co/LAUwYY7Cta
I stress kidnapping ‚Äî dragging victim into bedrm, having accomplice block her exit, turning music up to muffle her cries for help, covering her mouth to block outcry, putting her in fear of death ‚Äî because it‚Äôs the crime to which no Md statute of limitations applied even in 1980.
I‚Äôve been saying for days that, if Judge K becomes Justice K, Dr. Blasey Ford could file a criminal complaint against him in Md for felony attempted rape and felony kidnapping at any time. Glad to hear @maddow make just that point tonite ‚Äî though she omitted kidnapping.
While FBI investigates threats to kill Dr. Blasey Ford if she testifies that Judge Kavanaugh tried to rape her, surely they‚Äôre looking into who did what to whom at the time ‚Äî as would be usual whenever a new accusation emerges against a nominee. Or is Grassley saying NOT to look?
As ever more people see that Dr. Blasey Ford had no motive to make up a story about Judge Kavanaugh sexually assaulting her with Mark Judge‚Äôs help, some resort to a theory that white guys all look alike ‚Äî or maybe the real assailant happened to be a dead ringer for poor Brett. üôÉ

OPEN CHALLENGE TO JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH: 		Brett, if you‚Äôre really chomping at the bit to testify that you‚Äôre innocent, then insist that Trump &amp; Grassley tell FBI to REOPEN its BACKGROUND CHECK to learn all it can about what happened at that party ‚Äî and then TESTIFY UNDER OATH.

I disagree with those saying she has a moral DUTY to appear, given the ridiculously unfair terms set by the GOP. Reporting an attack, however many years later, creates no duty to enter a lion‚Äôs den on your opponents‚Äô terms. I‚Äôm just voicing my advice. It‚Äôs her decision to make.
Of course the RIGHT thing wd be for FBI to reopen its background check now, with either DJT or Grassley asking it to do so, and to investigate the witness tampering even without an ask. But odds are huge that the right thing WON‚ÄôT HAPPEN. Why shd Dr. Blasey Ford have to gamble???
@MsDebbieKingKe1 Demanding? No!! I‚Äôm urging, pleading, NOT ‚Äúdemanding.‚Äù
Dr. Blasey would enter the hearing with the wind at her back and history on her side if she accepts Senator Grassley‚Äôs obviously unfair terms under principled protest, saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be there Monday morning to speak truth to power and to my power-seeking attacker, Brett Kavanaugh.‚Äù

Any FBI investigation of efforts to deter an alleged sexual attack victim from testifying at an upcoming Senate hearing ‚Äî a federal crime under 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1512 ‚Äî would have to look into the substance of the alleged attack. No WH request needed! @chrislhayes @maddow @AriMelber https://t.co/SyVIh4LjW2
Maybe. Or maybe Mark Judge, later the author of ‚ÄúWasted,‚Äù bragged about the event at the time to his drinking buddies. What‚Äôs clear is that this cries out for investigation beyond a Senate committee‚Äôs capacity to undertake BY MONDAY, JUST 5 DAYS FROM NOW. https://t.co/YfqPlakx4C

The FBI clearly has jurisdiction, without any referral from the WH, to investigate the death threats, the hacking, and the harassment designed to prevent the alleged victim from appearing to testify before the US Senate. That would lead to investigating the alleged arrack itself
This letter absolutely needs to be followed up by the Senate Judiciary Committee, the FBI, and the WH.

"If she shows up and makes a credible showing that will be very interesting and we‚Äôll have to make a decision." ‚Äî Trump on Christine Blasey Ford. This strongly supports the view that, even if Grassley arbitrarily refuses to pause for preparatory investigation, she should testify
You‚Äôre right, @SRuhle, but the stakes are so enormous for the future of all women and the country as a whole that I want to see leading journalists like you leave no legal stone unturned. https://t.co/ESO9VhwcS1
If the hearing were postponed another week, or even just till Friday, both the FBI AND Maryland authorities (no SoL for sexual assault in Md, I believe) could investigate and lay the ground for a non-sham hearing. WHAT IS THERE TO LOSE? THIS IS A LIFETIME SEAT ON THE SUPREME CT.
Not a bad middle ground ‚Äî much better than giving Grassley and McConnell the argument that she was invited but ‚Äúpersisted‚Äù in ducking cross-examination under oath . . .

The argument that because sexual assault isn‚Äôt a federal crime FBI can‚Äôt investigate, its only role being to ensure a nominee isn‚Äôt a security risk, doesn‚Äôt work. A justice confirmed under this cloud could be blackmailed if evidence of perjury were to emerge later
No, so she can make them reveal their pathetic sexist fangs and can triumph over them through her credible, humanly sympathetic testimony. Not as good as having FBI investigate first, but far better than letting Grassley, Hatch, Cornyn, Cruz, et al, say she was exposed as a liar! https://t.co/9P5sSYj4yw
GOP game is clear: They‚Äôll go ahead &amp; vote Wednesday with no Monday hearing, blaming Dr. Blasey for declining her chance to testify. It‚Äôs disgusting but might work. Blasey must either cave and testify Monday or call their bluff and hope they‚Äôll blink. I‚Äôd reluctantly urge caving.

Good point. Maryland has no statute of limitations for rape or for assault, so it seems that both Brett Kavanaugh and Mark Judge remain potentially criminally liable for what Christine Blasey Ford alleges they did to her in high school. Nobody seems to be taking that into account https://t.co/b3Zf1IGXD4
It appears that Mark Judge says he won‚Äôt voluntarily testify under oath. If that‚Äôs true, the Senate Judiciary Committee must subpoena him. He has no criminal exposure (unless he has lied to the FBI), so he can‚Äôt take the 5th.

The legitimacy of a S.Ct. nominee‚Äôs refusal to say whether he or she regards a prior case (eg, Roe) as rightly decided and fully settled evaporates when the president has said he would nominate only someone who would overrule that case.

@GailHorn @ChrisCoons Of course. The issue for personal testimony remains undecided.
Replying to Sen. @ChrisCoons, Judge Kavanaugh established persuasively that his prior suggestion that US v. Nixon ‚Äúmay have been wrongly decided‚Äù did NOT mean he doubted the core holding that a sitting president MAY, in appropriate circumstances, be subpoenaed for WH documents.
Kavanaugh‚Äôs account of why he deleted text saying it‚Äôs ‚ÄúWIDELY ACCEPTED by legal scholars . . . that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land‚Äù fails. That not ‚ÄúALL legal scholars refer to Roe‚Äù that way is clear but is no explanation. 		https://t.co/KktUGVelKX
@janssenjliston Not at all strange. I was just taking the NYT editors‚Äô (possibly unintended) gender leak that came out late last night.
@ElstunL Mostly because that‚Äôs what a NYT editorial office post initially said.

In addition to being impeachable, Trump‚Äôs election law offenses were FEDERAL CRIMES committed when he was a private citizen in Trump Tower.

No amount of bad-mouthing of Mueller and his team can touch what happened in SDNY today when Trump‚Äôs longtime personal attorney and fixer turned on him by pleading guilty to criminally doing Trump‚Äôs bidding to cover up scandals that could‚Äôve cost him the election.
But Russia‚Äôs collusion remains on the table. The evidence of its role in Trump‚Äôs victory is rapidly mounting and will further establish the illegitimacy of Trump‚Äôs win in 2016. My point below is just that there is now a massive offense even without Putingate. https://t.co/h28FFnScg6

Today‚Äôs guilty pleas by Trump‚Äôs personal fixer Michael Cohen directly implicate the very legitimacy of his election as president. This is hardly the time to hold hearings on confirming a lifetime Justice. It‚Äôs the time to hold hearings on the election and whether Trump stole it.
Note well: This DOESN‚ÄôT DEPEND ON RUSSIAN COLLUSION or on OBSTRUCTION: @Lawrence @maddow @chrislhayes @AC360 https://t.co/IZGZXv8fua
Dear Congress: Cohen‚Äôs sworn allocution in SDNY in support of his pleas of guilty to having feloniously manipulated the 2016 election at Trump‚Äôs direction point directly to impeachable ‚Äúhigh crimes and misdemeanors‚Äù by Trump entirely apart from Russiagate and Obstructiongate.
They would be and were crimes by Trump, @LannyDavis. The remaining questions all relate to what remedies are realistically available and when. https://t.co/ZrtC3xssdx
In his West Virginia rally a couple hours from now, Trump is bound to try putting non-Russian lipstick this squealing pig. He‚Äôll make as much as he can of the fact that none of today‚Äôs pleas or convictions related to Russian collusion or obstruction of justice. Small consolation
No way Cohen would‚Äôve entered guilty pleas to eight felony counts in NYC today without either a sealed cooperation agreement or a confidential understanding with Mueller, which the plea agreement in SDNY expressly left open. So he still has key information on Trump to share.
@esglaude It certainly shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äî but it probably will.
Whether or not *called* an unindicted co-conspirator, that‚Äôs what the sitting president IS as of close of business today, August 21, 2018, a day that will live in legal infamy. That‚Äôs the import of two of Michael Cohen‚Äôs guilty pleas.
The mob family is coming unglued today with Trump‚Äôs campaign chairman Manafort convicted on 8 felony counts, and Trump‚Äôs personal fixer Cohen pleading guilty on 8 felony counts directly implicating Trump in campaign violations. 		https://t.co/r6kZY1SUY4

How Trump‚Äôs Outburst Over Security Clearances Harms the Presidency https://t.co/qjeHiFRr4k
By calling Manafort‚Äôs trial unfair and Paul a good man, Trump is tampering with the unsequestered jury, obstructing justice vis-a-vis Manafort, and hinting to Manafort that he‚Äôs in for a pardon unless he now starts cooperating with Mueller, thereby obstructing the Russia probe.
@JCBua Yes ‚Äî to tamper with the jury, obstruct justice vis-a-vis Manafort, and hint Manafort that he‚Äôs in for a pardon unless he now starts cooperating with Mueller.
Brennan‚Äôs security revocation, as part of an orgy of revocations and threats overtly designed to punish and gag Trump‚Äôs critics and cripple those investigating him, is an unconstitutional and impeachable abuse of power endangering our national security.		https://t.co/HgpqJvyEIe
May I assume Vladimir Putin would be bcc‚Äôd on all of Viceroy Erik Prince‚Äôs reports? https://t.co/9dLs998wya
Trump says punishing critics like former CIA Director Brennan gives their voices more, not less, reach and grows their earning power. That doesn‚Äôt cancel the 1st Am violation. And it sure doesn‚Äôt apply to lower-level employees like DOJ‚Äôs Bruce Ohr, who could become unemployable.
Trump‚Äôs reported interest in privatizing the Afghanistan war (using Blackwater, of course) isn‚Äôt surprising. After all, he has all but privatized the presidency.
@reynolds9047 @ProudResister I was being ironic
You‚Äôre complaining? I‚Äôd gladly trade places with you, @ProudResister! Being blocked by THIS president, especially in defiance of a federal court order, would be an honor. https://t.co/lWRakxKeDZ
Anybody who says former CIA Directors have no ‚Äúright‚Äù to retain their security clearance is totally missing the point. It‚Äôs the *American people and their intelligence officers* who have a right to include former directors as needed in decisions involving top secret information.
@SojournerNow @realDonaldTrump No
Mr. Trump: 		The classic way to commit a ‚Äúhigh Crime or Misdemeanor‚Äù is to ABUSE ‚Äî i.e., to use for an illegitimate purpose (like obstructing justice or punishing critics) ‚Äî a unilateral presidential power like the power to deny access to information or to dangle a pardon. 		LT
This sober bipartisan critique of Trump‚Äôs stripping of Brennan‚Äôs classification by 13 leading intel officers will predictably be dismissed by Trump as ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù self-defense. That dismissal will, like the claim of witchhunt, be pure hogwash. 		https://t.co/SccD4tLDcu
@bergerbeebs It‚Äôs ALL a species of abuse of power
@goreadalready I‚Äôm not, but it‚Äôs likely and Mueller can‚Äôt assume the contrary
I‚Äôve reluctantly concluded Mueller should proceed w/out subpoenaing Trump and gambling on how Justice Kavanaugh would vote only to have Trump take the 5th. The evidence already available almost certainly supports a report finding conspiracy with Russia and obstruction of justice

@tcsorr @RepSwalwell The whole operation was designed and directed by a conservative guy named John Brennan

Well said ‚Äî and exactly right ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/UXBDrYgegu
Any Commander in Chief who would deprive his intelligence agencies of the wisdom and experience of past CIA directors like Brennan by stripping them of security clearance is either an idiot or someone ready to endanger Americans to punish his critics ‚Äî or both. https://t.co/tUp3DZznnU
As @RepSwalwell says, Trump‚Äôs political manipulation of security clearances directly harms our nation‚Äôs security. John Brennan led the effort that killed Osama bin Laden. Most successful covert ops rely partly on advice from guys like Brennan. We‚Äôre hurt when they‚Äôre handicapped.
@TimInHonolulu @RudyGiuliani @ProudResister That could be different
.@RudyGiuliani may well be obstructing justice in a technical sense, @ProudResister, but to his credit Mueller isn‚Äôt wasting his time on clowns playing the role of lawyers.
