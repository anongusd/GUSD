@TheMattComer @Dennis_Peterson Well. While I don't find that you accused all GOPers of being racist, etc., I can understand how GOPers might be experiencing a bit of trauma right now -- I mean, the Grand Ole Party now has among its masses those you listed. That must be horrifying. With that, I get the comment.
@Dennis_Peterson @TheMattComer 3: The GOP, as it exists in this current moment, courts the KKK, neo-Nazis,  other white supremacists, xenophobes and other radical extremist  beliefs. Self-described white supremacists have literally grown in  numbers and taken up arms to defend this GOP and this president.
@TheMattComer @Dennis_Peterson The quote, in Tweet 8 of the thread is this: "Those opposed to the RNC because they are being violently targeted by  the GOP's fringe supporters have every right to be afraid.
