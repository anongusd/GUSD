@ThatElJefe Dude. I saw that movie and still can’t get over how much I hated it.
@OneFineJay Literally didn’t understand any of that. Lol. Admittedly I only watch reality tv and This Is Us.
@OneFineJay I dunno, but that gal’s last name is Cohan. So I might check it out. 🤣
Admittedly I only saw two of the Best Picture nominees, Green Book being one of them. Thought it was a phenomenal film.
So Charlize Theron hangs out at a townie bar drinking Bud? Huh.
Been waiting all night for a speech that authentic. https://t.co/q33OA8xMTn
@mchastain81 Happy happy birthday!
The Titanic theme still gets me every time. #90skid
I am already tired of the 2020 elections and it’s not even March of 2019 yet.
@OneFineJay Because Disney is out of ideas and they need to have some revenue that comes from somewhere other than the theme parks? In any event, I am giddy excited about it and every other remake.
Okay I correct myself. Mike Myers and Dana Carvey should have hosted the Oscars.
@1975jetsfan4 Good to know! I hadn’t seen it yet, but honestly Judy’s version is my favorite and I kind of want it to stay that way. Lol.
Is the new Star is Born worth seeing if you’ve seen all the other versions of it?
Well I guess now we know what a waste of time Oscar hosts are.
@KenShepherd But then again as a follower of Christ, there are churches in this country that won’t allow me to take communion. Each church has their own hiccups.
@KenShepherd I think people shouldn’t say things just to say them if they don’t believe them.
@KenShepherd No, that’s done personally not corporately. I have personally always found that portion of traditional services creepy rather than comforting. But I know everyone has their own preference in that department.
@KenShepherd No, we don’t do corporate recitation in that way. We memorize a verse a week with the kids, as I did when I was a child. We stand and read God’s Word together before the pastor teaches on that section of scripture.
@KenShepherd It’s nice to know the Creed and all, but I take the most pride of having memorized hundreds of verses from Scripture, and also memorizing a few of Paul’s letters in their entirety. All done in my non-denom churches. My kids memorize a verse a week at church.
@KenShepherd Zero because we are busy reading directly from Scripture?
@KenShepherd I memorized it at my evangelical Christian college for a class that was part my required courses in biblical theology. 🤷🏻‍♀️
@bethanyshondark That’s what my kids call it too! These kids are all onto something...
@marcaross It’s a Michael W Smith classic. He and Amy Grant sang it together at the memorial for the Columbine victims.
Even Michael W Smith choked up at the end of that one. It’s super dusty in my house all of a sudden.
@andylancaster This friend was played at my best friend’s dad’s funeral. He and Amy sang it at their Christmas I went to last year, too. #classic
I can never listen to this song without crying. It is one of my all-time favorites.
