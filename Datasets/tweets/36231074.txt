Remember, Pate chased fraud for years, only to admit last weekend that we don't have a voter fraud problem in IA. Now, thanks to him, the only problem we have is a voter ID law that is confusing, complicated, and a barrier to the ballot box.

IA is rolling back time with increased barriers to voting that will impact students, seniors &amp; our disabled community. Honoring Dr. King‚Äôs legacy means more than talking about that work done 50 years ago ‚Äì we must commit to fight against injustice every single day.
50 yrs ago, we lost a true champion for voting rights, equality, and justice. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.‚Äôs legacy is long reaching and runs deep across our country; however, it was his work to expand access to the ballot box for all eligible voters that is most on my mind today.

@andersoncooper "I was told not 2 communicate with them" He was also told not 2 pursue TM. He doesn't care what he is told. He's egocentric.

#redtails I was so excited for this effort...but let down...and learned nothing. Could have done a 2 hour CBS special and spent less $$$
#redtails we're Howard and gooding asked to play 21st century Tuskegee airmen on wall street. I saw no authenticity in their roles.
#redtails the character development was shallow...not to mention Robert Downey jr. Played a better black man than Howard and gooding.
#redtails I must have watched a different movie than everyone else. Did Lucas finish the movie...it seemed to me to be a 2 hour preview
Go to sleep...Deidre! But I need to find more people to follow!
So u heard of that movie redtails, right...right so ummm....ummm...dang! I can't bring myself to say it...
Im....im just...well...dang
