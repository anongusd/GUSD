They didn‚Äôt ask about climate change tonight, but let‚Äôs talk about it: Let‚Äôs talk about how we only have 12 years to make a change before we start to see catastrophic effects across the planet that will change the way we live. #KRQEDebate #nmpol #nmsen
Martin‚Äôs priorities are New Mexico‚Äôs priorities: an economy that works for everyone, affordable health care, protecting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, addressing climate change, and bringing more opportunity to our state. #krqedebate #Nmpol #nmsen
Actually, Martin has brought home the bacon ‚Äî he has worked to secure over a billion dollars in investments for our bases, so they will always be here and continue to be at the forefront of our national security. #KRQEDebate #nmpol #nmsen
Our minimum wage has fallen behind, and with it, our workers. It‚Äôs time to bring our federal minimum wage to a livable wage of $15/hour. #FightFor15 #KRQEDebate #nmpol
Martin is proud of his vote for the ACA ‚Äî it protected over 800,000 New Mexicans with pre-existing conditions for the first time ever. #KRQEDebate #nmpol #nmsen https://t.co/hidDtjTxcR
We have a gun violence epidemic in this country. We need to take action ‚Äî that‚Äôs why Martin supports banning bump stocks, as well as enforcing universal background checks and limiting magazine capacity. #KRQEDebate  #nmpol #nmsen
Sexual assault is a crime. Calling it high school misbehavior or inappropriate is insulting to survivors and a dangerous message to send to all of our young people. #BelieveSurvivors #KRQEDebate #nmpol
Republicans dug us into a deficit hole with their tax cuts for millionaires. Instead of cutting Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security for the rest of us, we should undo the tax cuts for the 1%. #KRQEDebate #nmsen #nmpol
Accusing refugees of charging our border is despicable and only sows more divisions in our already divided country. We should be focused on real solutions and comprehensive immigration reform. #KRQEDebate #nmpol #nmsen

But there is more to do. In his next term, Martin will keep fighting to make sure every New Mexican has a shot at a fair deal.
Martin defended Medicaid against Republican attacks that would have closed rural hospitals, and he made it easier for veterans to get health care at home.
Martin worked to improve education through reform that focuses on teaching, not testing, and promoting STEM education for our kids.
As New Mexico has become a leader in solar and wind energy, Martin has championed a renewable energy transmission line that will allow New Mexico to export that energy out of state.
Martin negotiated a deal to extend federal renewable energy tax credits, leading to a boom in renewable energy jobs and investments, and projects like Sagamore Wind Farm in Roosevelt County.
Martin has made it easier for small businesses to partner with our labs to commercialize the tech developed there and create successful spin-off companies like @PajaritoPowder.
