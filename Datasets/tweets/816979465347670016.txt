Basically the Democrats resist the American President at every turn with impunity. I wonder if they would continue if North Korea started shooting rockets towards their constituents? Democrats, Soros, Steyer, Bloomberg Et al have no concept of what being real a American is about.
@HARRISFAULKNER @BretBaier I think it would be very difficult for @realDonaldTrump to make a deal with North Korea when you have wall to wall coverage from media for the month prior to the meeting. The Democrats scheduled the meeting so Trump wouldn‚Äôt WIN. Dems say it was a loss.
The American people should feel safe about the people in our most important positions in government. These people are lawmakers.
Does everyone have an equal chance?		Are we performing background checks of people running for Congress? FBI should have mandatory investigations of any federal election primary winners. This should be known. Soros keeps spending money with his buddy Steyer &amp; Bloomberg. Unsafe!!

What else did Stormy ‚õà get out of the deal? Trump said it never happened. Cohen already knew Trump would just pay. He knew Trump would just nod. Democrats plan this stuff long in advance. Remember Blasey? They knew the list of SCOTUS Trump had. Back to Cohen with the Lanny Davis
How many of the personal checks? Does it add up to $130,000? Why did Stormy settle at such a low amount? Trump was a billionaire. I think she settled because it had to be a DONE DEAL. That was another insurance policy? I think they searched pics of Trump online &amp; made decision.
@Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows @CongressmanHice One thing to think about, yesterday Cohen said he was on retainer. I think he said he would pickup a check that the CFO would sign &amp; Jr. How much was the retainer. Then he showed the check that President signed from the Whitehouse.
