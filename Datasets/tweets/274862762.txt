@JoeCro and what about judicial estoppel? how can he argue that his sentence was too light to win on appeal, then argue he's innocent?!
@JoeCro and, I don't remember evidence well enough but... the evidence of his guilty plea won't be allowed in, will it?
@JoeCro saw this today - makes no sense. QUITE the gamble he's taking... if he wins on appeal then loses at trial... goodbye, life.
@bbrowndotcom no way, he thought it was hilarious. I bet he hates those rent-a-cops too.
